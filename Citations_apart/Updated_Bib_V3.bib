	abstract = {Robots are having an important growing role in human social life, which requires them to be able to behave appropriately to the context of interaction so as to create a successful long-term human-robot relationship. A major challenge in developing intelligent systems, which could enhance the interactive abilities of robots, is defining clear metrics and benchmarks for the different aspects of human-robot interaction, like human and robot skills and performances, which could facilitate comparing between systems and avoid application-biased evaluations based on particular measures. The point of evaluating robotic systems through metrics and benchmarks, in addition to some recent frameworks and technologies that could endow robots with advanced cognitive and communicative abilities, are discussed in this technical report that covers the outcome of our recent workshop on current advances in cognitive robotics: Towards Intelligent Social Robots - Current Advances in Cognitive Robotics, in conjunction with the 15th {IEEE}-{RAS} Humanoids Conference - Seoul - South Korea - 2015 (https://intelligent-robots-ws.ensta-paristech.fr/). Additionally, a summary of an interactive discussion session between the workshop participants and the invited speakers about different issues related to cognitive robotics research is reported.},
