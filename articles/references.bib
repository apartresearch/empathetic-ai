The {CM} refers to the study of how individuals cognitively process social stimuli and the relation between the cognitions of individuals and sociocultural representations. Ethical considerations may have been involved in the shift to the {CM}. Because artifact challenges focused attention of Ss' thoughts and perceptions, the crisis literature directly promoted the {CM}. Artifact research has also shaped the direction of research with the {CM}. Results indicate the need for greater attention to instructions to Ss; continued improved techniques for accessing Ss' cognitions; increased sensitivity to Ss' phenomenological experiences as research participants; and a broadening of a narrow methodological and substantive focus.

	abstract = {Previous research on pandemics and emergencies has shown that such events often widen health inequalities in society and have a greater impact on socially disadvantaged groups. No review has so far looked at the impact of inequality factors on mental health outcomes during the novel coronavirus outbreak ({COVID}-19). The aim of the current review was therefore to assess the impact of inequality factors on mental health outcomes during {COVID}-19. After registration on {PROSPERO}, a systematic review was conducted for papers published up to July 31, 2020, using the databases Google Scholar, {PsycINFO}, {PubMed} ({MEDLINE}), and Web of Science. The following inequality factors were considered: education, income, employment, occupation, material and social deprivation, age, immigrant status, sexual orientation, functional health, cultural/racial background, sex, gender, and place of residence. Out of 1,931 references, 117 studies (300,061 participants) were included. Female sex, being of a younger age, financial insecurity, lack of access to clear messaging/information about the pandemic, proximity to large infection sites, having existing physical and/or psychological health conditions, and being subjected to abuse/stigma because of one’s identity as a member of an ethnic or sexual marginalized group predicted mental health inequalities. More research is required on how inequality affects mental health in less studied vulnerable populations, such as ethnic, sexual, and gender marginalized participants, as well as how inequality factors interact to affect mental health in the long term. Recommendations for researchers, mental health practitioners, and public health authorities for mitigating adverse mental health outcomes in vulnerable populations are outlined.

It then examines how these inequalities in {COVID}-19 are related to existing inequalities in chronic diseases and the social determinants of health, arguing that we are experiencing a syndemic pandemic. It then explores the potential consequences for health inequalities of the lockdown measures implemented internationally as a response to the {COVID}-19 pandemic, focusing on the likely unequal impacts of the economic crisis.

Yet, persisting digital inequality suggests that not everyone will be equally able or disposed to increasing digital communication during a public health crisis. Using survey data from a national sample of U.S. participants (N = 2,925) that we collected during the early months of the pandemic, we analyzed how sociodemographics, living arrangements, and Internet experiences and skills relate to increases and decreases in various digital communication methods. We find that people privileged in their socioeconomic status, their Internet skills and online experiences are more likely to increase and less likely to decrease digital communication during the pandemic. The findings illustrate how digital inequalities can put already disadvantaged groups at greater risk of diminished social contact during a public health crisis. We discuss the theoretical implications of our findings for digital inequality research, the practical implications for inclusive crisis responses, and directions for future research.},

It ranks as the fourth most popular source for accessing emergency information. Many studies have explored social media data to understand the networks and extract critical information to develop a pre- and post-disaster mitigation plan. The 2016 flood in Louisiana damaged more than 60,000 homes and was the worst U.S. disaster after Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Parishes in Louisiana actively used their social media to share information with the disaster-affected community − e.g., flood inundation map, locations of emergency shelters, medical services, and debris removal operation. This study applies social network analysis to convert emergency social network data into knowledge. We explore patterns created by the aggregated interactions of online users on Facebook during disaster responses. It provides insights to understand the critical role of social media use for emergency information propagation. The study results show social networks consist of three entities: individuals, emergency agencies, and organizations. The core of a social network consists of numerous individuals. They are actively engaged to share information, communicate with the city of Baton Rouge, and update information. Emergency agencies and organizations are on the periphery of the social network, connecting a community with other communities. The results of this study will help emergency agencies develop their social media operation strategies for a disaster mitigation plan.},

	abstract = {The past two decades have seen an upsurge of interest in the collective behaviors of complex systems composed of many agents entrained to each other and to external events. In this paper, we extend the concept of entrainment to the dynamics of human collective attention. We conducted a detailed investigation of the unfolding of human entrainment—as expressed by the content and patterns of hundreds of thousands of messages on Twitter—during the 2012 {US} presidential debates. By time-locking these data sources, we quantify the impact of the unfolding debate on human attention at three time scales. We show that collective social behavior covaries second-by-second to the interactional dynamics of the debates: A candidate speaking induces rapid increases in mentions of his name on social media and decreases in mentions of the other candidate. Moreover, interruptions by an interlocutor increase the attention received. We also highlight a distinct time scale for the impact of salient content during the debates: Across well-known remarks in each debate, mentions in social media start within 5–10 seconds after it occurs; peak at approximately one minute; and slowly decay in a consistent fashion across well-known events during the debates. Finally, we show that public attention after an initial burst slowly decays through the course of the debates. Thus we demonstrate that large-scale human entrainment may hold across a number of distinct scales, in an exquisitely time-locked fashion. The methods and results pave the way for careful study of the dynamics and mechanisms of large-scale human entrainment.},

	abstract = {With the rapid growth of the Web, users easily get lost in the rich hyper structure. Providing the relevant information to users to cater to their needs is the primary goal of Website owners. Therefore, finding the content of the Web and retrieving the users' interests and needs from their behavior have become increasingly important. Web mining is used to categorize users and pages by analyzing user behavior, the content of the pages, and the order of the {URLs} that tend to be accessed. Web structure mining plays an important role in this approach. Two page ranking algorithms, {HITS} and {PageRank}, are commonly used in Web structure mining. Both algorithms treat all links equally when distributing rank scores. Several algorithms have been developed to improve the performance of these methods. The weighted {PageRank} algorithm ({WPR}), an extension to the standard {PageRank} algorithm, is introduced. {WPR} takes into account the importance of both the inlinks and the outlinks of the pages and distributes rank scores based on the popularity of the pages. The results of our simulation studies show that {WPR} performs better than the conventional {PageRank} algorithm in terms of returning a larger number of relevant pages to a given query.},

These highly interconnected systems have recently been the focus of a great deal of attention that has uncovered and characterized their topological complexity. Along with a complex topological structure, real networks display a large heterogeneity in the capacity and intensity of the connections. These features, however, have mainly not been considered in past studies where links are usually represented as binary states, i.e., either present or absent. Here, we study the scientific collaboration network and the world-wide air-transportation network, which are representative examples of social and large infrastructure systems, respectively. In both cases it is possible to assign to each edge of the graph a weight proportional to the intensity or capacity of the connections among the various elements of the network. We define appropriate metrics combining weighted and topological observables that enable us to characterize the complex statistical properties and heterogeneity of the actual strength of edges and vertices. This information allows us to investigate the correlations among weighted quantities and the underlying topological structure of the network. These results provide a better description of the hierarchies and organizational principles at the basis of the architecture of weighted networks.},

Both algorithms are extremely sensitive to their input parameters: m (length of the data segment being compared), r (similarity criterion), and N (length of data). There is no established consensus on parameter selection in short data sets, especially for biological data. Therefore, the purpose of this research was to examine the robustness of these two entropy algorithms by exploring the effect of changing parameter values on short data sets. Data with known theoretical entropy qualities as well as experimental data from both healthy young and older adults was utilized. Our results demonstrate that both {ApEn} and {SampEn} are extremely sensitive to parameter choices, especially for very short data sets, N ≤ 200. We suggest using N larger than 200, an m of 2 and examine several r values before selecting your parameters. Extreme caution should be used when choosing parameters for experimental studies with both algorithms. Based on our current findings, it appears that {SampEn} is more reliable for short data sets. {SampEn} was less sensitive to changes in data length and demonstrated fewer problems with relative consistency.},

	abstract = {As users interact via social media spaces, like Twitter, they form connections that emerge into complex social network structures. These connections are indicators of content sharing, and network structures reflect patterns of information flow. This article proposes a conceptual and practical model for the classification of topical Twitter networks, based on their network-level structures. As current literature focuses on the classification of users to key positions, this study utilizes the overall network structures in order to classify Twitter conversation based on their patterns of information flow. Four network-level metrics, which have established as indicators of information flow characteristics—density, modularity, centralization, and the fraction of isolated users—are utilized in a three-step classification model. This process led us to suggest six structures of information flow: divided, unified, fragmented, clustered, in and out hub-and-spoke networks. We demonstrate the value of these network structures by segmenting 60 Twitter topical social media network datasets into these six distinct patterns of collective connections, illustrating how different topics of conversations exhibit different patterns of information flow. We discuss conceptual and practical implications for each structure.},

Here, we fill this gap of knowledge by developing a classical framework for networks based on finding an optimal trade-off between the information content of a compressed representation of the ensemble and the information content of the actual network ensemble. In this way not only we introduce a novel classical network ensemble satisfying a set of soft constraints but we are also able to calculate the optimal distribution of the constraints. We show that for the classical network ensemble in which the only constraints are the expected degrees a power-law degree distribution is optimal. Also, we study spatially embedded networks finding that the interactions between nodes naturally lead to non-uniform spread of nodes in the space, with pairs of nodes at a given distance not necessarily obeying a power-law distribution. The pertinent features of real-world air transportation networks are well described by the proposed framework.},

Integrating these approaches offers unique opportunities to gain insights into human behaviour that neither the evaluation of social networks nor agent-based models alone can provide. There are many intriguing examples that demonstrate this potential, for instance in epidemiology, marketing or social dynamics. Based on an extensive literature review, we provide an overview on coupling {ABM} with {SNA} and evaluating the integrated approach. Building on this, we identify current shortcomings in the combination of the two methods. The greatest room for improvement is found with regard to (i) the consideration of the concept of social integration through networks, (ii) an increased use of the co-evolutionary character of social networks and embedded agents, and (iii) a systematic and quantitative model analysis focusing on the causal relationship between the agents and the network. Furthermore, we highlight the importance of a comprehensive and clearly structured model conceptualization and documentation. We synthesize our findings in guidelines that contain the main aspects to consider when integrating social networks into agent-based models.},

	abstract = {Background
Artificial intelligence has recently attained humanlike performance in a number of gamelike domains. These advances have been spurred by brain-inspired architectures and algorithms such as hierarchical filtering and reinforcement learning. {OpenAI} Gym is an open-source platform in which to train, test, and benchmark algorithms—it provides a range of tasks, including those of classic arcade games such as Doom. Here we describe how the platform might be used as a simulation, test, and diagnostic paradigm for psychiatric conditions.
Methods
To illustrate how active inference models of game play could be used to test mechanistic and algorithmic properties of psychiatric disorders, we provide two exemplar analyses. The first speaks to the impact of aging on cognition, examining game-play behaviors in a model of aging in which we compared age-dependent changes of younger (n = 9, 22 ± 1 years of age) and older (n = 7, 56 ± 5 years of age) adult players. The second is an illustration of a putative feature of anhedonia in which we simulated diminished sensitivity to reward.
Results
These simulations demonstrate how active inference can be used to test predicted changes in both neurobiology and beliefs in psychiatric cohorts. We show that, as well as behavioral measures, putative neural correlates of active inference can be simulated, and hypothesized (model-based) differences in local field potentials and blood oxygen level–dependent responses can be produced.
Conclusions
We show that active inference, through epistemic and value-based goals, enables simulated subjects to actively develop detailed representations of gaming environments, and we demonstrate the use of a principled algorithmic and neurobiological framework for testing hypotheses in psychiatric illness.},

	abstract = {Humanoid social robots have an increasingly prominent place in today’s world. Their acceptance in social and emotional human–robot interaction ({HRI}) scenarios depends on their ability to convey well recognized and believable emotional expressions to their human users. In this article, we incorporate recent findings from psychology, neuroscience, human–computer interaction, and {HRI}, to examine how people recognize and respond to emotions displayed by the body and voice of humanoid robots, with a particular emphasis on the effects of incongruence. In a social {HRI} laboratory experiment, we investigated contextual incongruence (i.e., the conflict situation where a robot’s reaction is incongrous with the socio-emotional context of the interaction) and cross-modal incongruence (i.e., the conflict situation where an observer receives incongruous emotional information across the auditory (vocal prosody) and visual (whole-body expressions) modalities). Results showed that both contextual incongruence and cross-modal incongruence confused observers and decreased the likelihood that they accurately recognized the emotional expressions of the robot. This, in turn, gives the impression that the robot is unintelligent or unable to express “empathic” behaviour and leads to profoundly harmful effects on likability and believability. Our findings reinforce the need of proper design of emotional expressions for robots that use several channels to communicate their emotional states in a clear and effective way. We offer recommendations regarding design choices and discuss future research areas in the direction of multimodal {HRI}.},

For example, a model with a backdoor always identifies a face as Bill Gates if a specific symbol is present in the input. Backdoors can stay hidden indefinitely until activated by an input, and present a serious security risk to many security or safety related applications, e.g. biometric authentication systems or self-driving cars. We present the first robust and generalizable detection and mitigation system for {DNN} backdoor attacks. Our techniques identify backdoors and reconstruct possible triggers. We identify multiple mitigation techniques via input filters, neuron pruning and unlearning. We demonstrate their efficacy via extensive experiments on a variety of {DNNs}, against two types of backdoor injection methods identified by prior work. Our techniques also prove robust against a number of variants of the backdoor attack.},

	abstract = {In machine learning Trojan attacks, an adversary trains a corrupted model that obtains good performance on normal data but behaves maliciously on data samples with certain trigger patterns. Several approaches have been proposed to detect such attacks, but they make undesirable assumptions about the attack strategies or require direct access to the trained models, which restricts their utility in practice.This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a Meta Neural Trojan Detection ({MNTD}) pipeline that does not make assumptions on the attack strategies and only needs black-box access to models. The strategy is to train a meta-classifier that predicts whether a given target model is Trojaned. To train the meta-model without knowledge of the attack strategy, we introduce a technique called jumbo learning that samples a set of Trojaned models following a general distribution. We then dynamically optimize a query set together with the meta-classifier to distinguish between Trojaned and benign models.We evaluate {MNTD} with experiments on vision, speech, tabular data and natural language text datasets, and against different Trojan attacks such as data poisoning attack, model manipulation attack, and latent attack. We show that {MNTD} achieves 97\% detection {AUC} score and significantly outperforms existing detection approaches. In addition, {MNTD} generalizes well and achieves high detection performance against unforeseen attacks. We also propose a robust {MNTD} pipeline which achieves around 90\% detection {AUC} even when the attacker aims to evade the detection with full knowledge of the system.},

	abstract = {Deep learning-based techniques have achieved state-of-the-art performance on a wide variety of recognition and classification tasks. However, these networks are typically computationally expensive to train, requiring weeks of computation on many {GPUs}; as a result, many users outsource the training procedure to the cloud or rely on pre-trained models that are then fine-tuned for a specific task. In this paper we show that outsourced training introduces new security risks: an adversary can create a maliciously trained network (a backdoored neural network, or a {\textbackslash}emph\{{BadNet}\}) that has state-of-the-art performance on the user's training and validation samples, but behaves badly on specific attacker-chosen inputs. We first explore the properties of {BadNets} in a toy example, by creating a backdoored handwritten digit classifier. Next, we demonstrate backdoors in a more realistic scenario by creating a U.S. street sign classifier that identifies stop signs as speed limits when a special sticker is added to the stop sign; we then show in addition that the backdoor in our {US} street sign detector can persist even if the network is later retrained for another task and cause a drop in accuracy of \{25\}{\textbackslash}\% on average when the backdoor trigger is present. These results demonstrate that backdoors in neural networks are both powerful and---because the behavior of neural networks is difficult to explicate---stealthy. This work provides motivation for further research into techniques for verifying and inspecting neural networks, just as we have developed tools for verifying and debugging software.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2204.06974},
	abstract = {Given the computational cost and technical expertise required to train machine learning models, users may delegate the task of learning to a service provider. We show how a malicious learner can plant an undetectable backdoor into a classifier. On the surface, such a backdoored classifier behaves normally, but in reality, the learner maintains a mechanism for changing the classification of any input, with only a slight perturbation. Importantly, without the appropriate "backdoor key", the mechanism is hidden and cannot be detected by any computationally-bounded observer. We demonstrate two frameworks for planting undetectable backdoors, with incomparable guarantees. First, we show how to plant a backdoor in any model, using digital signature schemes. The construction guarantees that given black-box access to the original model and the backdoored version, it is computationally infeasible to find even a single input where they differ. This property implies that the backdoored model has generalization error comparable with the original model. Second, we demonstrate how to insert undetectable backdoors in models trained using the Random Fourier Features ({RFF}) learning paradigm or in Random {ReLU} networks. In this construction, undetectability holds against powerful white-box distinguishers: given a complete description of the network and the training data, no efficient distinguisher can guess whether the model is "clean" or contains a backdoor. Our construction of undetectable backdoors also sheds light on the related issue of robustness to adversarial examples. In particular, our construction can produce a classifier that is indistinguishable from an "adversarially robust" classifier, but where every input has an adversarial example! In summary, the existence of undetectable backdoors represent a significant theoretical roadblock to certifying adversarial robustness.},

Pre-trained {AI} models may contain back-doors that are injected through training or by transforming inner neuron weights. These trojaned models operate normally when regular inputs are provided, and mis-classify to a specific output label when the input is stamped with some special pattern called trojan trigger. We develop a novel technique that analyzes inner neuron behaviors by determining how output activations change when we introduce different levels of stimulation to a neuron. The neurons that substantially elevate the activation of a particular output label regardless of the provided input is considered potentially compromised. Trojan trigger is then reverse-engineered through an optimization procedure using the stimulation analysis results, to confirm that a neuron is truly compromised. We evaluate our system {ABS} on 177 trojaned models that are trojaned with various attack methods that target both the input space and the feature space, and have various trojan trigger sizes and shapes, together with 144 benign models that are trained with different data and initial weight values. These models belong to 7 different model structures and 6 different datasets, including some complex ones such as {ImageNet}, {VGG}-Face and {ResNet}110. Our results show that {ABS} is highly effective, can achieve over 90\% detection rate for most cases (and many 100\%), when only one input sample is provided for each output label. It substantially out-performs the state-of-the-art technique Neural Cleanse that requires a lot of input samples and small trojan triggers to achieve good performance.},

To further our understanding of the impact of scale on few-shot learning, we trained a 540-billion parameter, densely activated, Transformer language model, which we call Pathways Language Model {PaLM}. We trained {PaLM} on 6144 {TPU} v4 chips using Pathways, a new {ML} system which enables highly efficient training across multiple {TPU} Pods. We demonstrate continued benefits of scaling by achieving state-of-the-art few-shot learning results on hundreds of language understanding and generation benchmarks. On a number of these tasks, {PaLM} 540B achieves breakthrough performance, outperforming the finetuned state-of-the-art on a suite of multi-step reasoning tasks, and outperforming average human performance on the recently released {BIG}-bench benchmark. A significant number of {BIG}-bench tasks showed discontinuous improvements from model scale, meaning that performance steeply increased as we scaled to our largest model. {PaLM} also has strong capabilities in multilingual tasks and source code generation, which we demonstrate on a wide array of benchmarks. We additionally provide a comprehensive analysis on bias and toxicity, and study the extent of training data memorization with respect to model scale. Finally, we discuss the ethical considerations related to large language models and discuss potential mitigation strategies.},

	abstract = {We build a rigorous bridge between deep networks ({DNs}) and approximation theory via spline functions and operators. Our key result is that a large class of {DNs} can be written as a composition of max-affine spline operators ({MASOs}), which provide a powerful portal through which to view and analyze their inner workings. For instance, conditioned on the input signal, the output of a {MASO} {DN} can be written as a simple affine transformation of the input. This implies that a {DN} constructs a set of signal-dependent, class-specific templates against which the signal is compared via a simple inner product; we explore the links to the classical theory of optimal classification via matched filters and the effects of data memorization. Going further, we propose a simple penalty term that can be added to the cost function of any {DN} learning algorithm to force the templates to be orthogonal with each other; this leads to significantly improved classification performance and reduced overfitting with no change to the {DN} architecture. The spline partition of the input signal space opens up a new geometric avenue to study how {DNs} organize signals in a hierarchical fashion. As an application, we develop and validate a new distance metric for signals that quantifies the difference between their partition encodings.},

In order to create empathy between human-robot, a robot must be able to estimate the emotion of human and reflect the same emotion on its expression. In general, emotion can be estimated based on observable expressions such as facial expression, or unobservable expressions such as biological signals. Although there are many methods for measuring emotion from both facial expression and biological signals, few studies have been done on the comparison of estimated emotion. In this paper, we investigate whether emotion estimated from facial expression or biological signals could lead to empathy toward a robot. Using our proposed emotion estimation system, we performed two experiments and found that higher impression was rated on sociability elements with significant when the reflected emotion is estimated from uncontrollable emotion.},

	abstract = {We propose a benchmark to measure whether a language model is truthful in generating answers to questions. The benchmark comprises 817 questions that span 38 categories, including health, law, finance and politics. We crafted questions that some humans would answer falsely due to a false belief or misconception. To perform well, models must avoid generating false answers learned from imitating human texts. We tested {GPT}-3, {GPT}-Neo/J, {GPT}-2 and a T5-based model. The best model was truthful on 58\% of questions, while human performance was 94\%. Models generated many false answers that mimic popular misconceptions and have the potential to deceive humans. The largest models were generally the least truthful. This contrasts with other {NLP} tasks, where performance improves with model size. However, this result is expected if false answers are learned from the training distribution. We suggest that scaling up models alone is less promising for improving truthfulness than fine-tuning using training objectives other than imitation of text from the web.},

The loss scales as a power-law with model size, dataset size, and the amount of compute used for training, with some trends spanning more than seven orders of magnitude. Other architectural details such as network width or depth have minimal effects within a wide range. Simple equations govern the dependence of overfitting on model/dataset size and the dependence of training speed on model size. These relationships allow us to determine the optimal allocation of a fixed compute budget. Larger models are significantly more sample-efficient, such that optimally compute-efficient training involves training very large models on a relatively modest amount of data and stopping significantly before convergence.},

More specifically, we assess {GPT}-3's decision-making, information search, deliberation, and causal reasoning abilities on a battery of canonical experiments from the literature. We find that much of {GPT}-3's behavior is impressive: it solves vignette-based tasks similarly or better than human subjects, is able to make decent decisions from descriptions, outperforms humans in a multi-armed bandit task, and shows signatures of model-based reinforcement learning. Yet we also find that small perturbations to vignette-based tasks can lead {GPT}-3 vastly astray, that it shows no signatures of directed exploration, and that it fails miserably in a causal reasoning task. These results enrich our understanding of current large language models and pave the way for future investigations using tools from cognitive psychology to study increasingly capable and opaque artificial agents.},

	abstract = {Social network analysis provides a broad and complex perspective on animal sociality that is widely applicable to almost any species. Recent applications demonstrate the utility of network analysis for advancing our understanding of the dynamics, selection pressures, development, and evolution of complex social systems. However, most studies of animal social networks rely primarily on a descriptive approach. To propel the field of animal social networks beyond exploratory analyses and to facilitate the integration of quantitative methods that allow for the testing of ecologically and evolutionarily relevant hypotheses, we review methodological and conceptual advances in network science, which are underutilized in studies of animal sociality. First, we highlight how the use of statistical modeling and triadic motifs analysis can advance our understanding of the processes that structure networks. Second, we discuss how the consideration of temporal changes and spatial constraints can shed light on the dynamics of social networks. Third, we consider how the study of variation at multiple scales can potentially transform our understanding of the structure and function of animal networks. We direct readers to analytical tools that facilitate the adoption of these new concepts and methods. Our goal is to provide behavioral ecologists with a toolbox of current methods that can stimulate novel insights into the ecological influences and evolutionary pressures structuring networks and advance our understanding of the proximate and ultimate processes that drive animal sociality.},

This task is often facilitated by the use of dedicated, specialized frameworks. For almost thirty years, many such agent platforms have been developed. Meanwhile, some of them have been abandoned, others continue their development and new platforms are released. This paper presents a up-to-date review of the existing agent platforms and also a historical perspective of this domain. It aims to serve as a reference point for people interested in developing agent systems. This work details the main characteristics of the included agent platforms, together with links to specific projects where they have been used. It distinguishes between the active platforms and those no longer under development or with unclear status. It also classifies the agent platforms as general purpose ones, free or commercial, and specialized ones, which can be used for particular types of applications.},

Analysis of the long-time behaviour of the null models reveals a simple trade-off in the role of the parameters of the metric, suggesting methods to calibrate parameters and to adapt to temporal variations in the network properties. The null models introduced address two main classes of temporal networks (contact sequences and interval graphs), and their predictions are compared and contrasted with results coming from real-world telecommunications data.},

However, we prove the surprising result that, under realistic conditions, for any graph topology, the stronger virus completely wipes-out the weaker one, thus not merely 'winning' but 'taking it all'. In addition to the proofs, we also demonstrate our result with simulations over diverse, real graph topologies, including the social-contact graph of the city of Portland {OR} (about 31 million edges and 1 million nodes) and internet {AS} router graphs. Finally, we also provide real data about competing products from Google-Insights, like Facebook-Myspace, and we show again that they agree with our analysis.},

These highly interconnected systems have recently been the focus of a great deal of attention that has uncovered and characterized their topological complexity. Along with a complex topological structure, real networks display a large heterogeneity in the capacity and intensity of the connections. These features, however, have mainly not been considered in past studies where links are usually represented as binary states, i.e., either present or absent. Here, we study the scientific collaboration network and the world-wide air-transportation network, which are representative examples of social and large infrastructure systems, respectively. In both cases it is possible to assign to each edge of the graph a weight proportional to the intensity or capacity of the connections among the various elements of the network. We define appropriate metrics combining weighted and topological observables that enable us to characterize the complex statistical properties and heterogeneity of the actual strength of edges and vertices. This information allows us to investigate the correlations among weighted quantities and the underlying topological structure of the network. These results provide a better description of the hierarchies and organizational principles at the basis of the architecture of weighted networks.},

	abstract = {A great variety of systems in nature, society and technology–from the web of sexual contacts to the Internet, from the nervous system to power grids–can be modeled as graphs of vertices coupled by edges. The network structure, describing how the graph is wired, helps us understand, predict and optimize the behavior of dynamical systems. In many cases, however, the edges are not continuously active. As an example, in networks of communication via e-mail, text messages, or phone calls, edges represent sequences of instantaneous or practically instantaneous contacts. In some cases, edges are active for non-negligible periods of time: e.g., the proximity patterns of inpatients at hospitals can be represented by a graph where an edge between two individuals is on throughout the time they are at the same ward. Like network topology, the temporal structure of edge activations can affect dynamics of systems interacting through the network, from disease contagion on the network of patients to information diffusion over an e-mail network. In this review, we present the emergent field of temporal networks, and discuss methods for analyzing topological and temporal structure and models for elucidating their relation to the behavior of dynamical systems. In the light of traditional network theory, one can see this framework as moving the information of when things happen from the dynamical system on the network, to the network itself. Since fundamental properties, such as the transitivity of edges, do not necessarily hold in temporal networks, many of these methods need to be quite different from those for static networks. The study of temporal networks is very interdisciplinary in nature. Reflecting this, even the object of study has many names—temporal graphs, evolving graphs, time-varying graphs, time-aggregated graphs, time-stamped graphs, dynamic networks, dynamic graphs, dynamical graphs, and so on. This review covers different fields where temporal graphs are considered, but does not attempt to unify related terminology—rather, we want to make papers readable across disciplines.},

Here we show how the widely used community finding technique of modularity maximization can be generalized in a principled fashion to incorporate information contained in edge directions. We describe an explicit algorithm based on spectral optimization of the modularity and show that it gives demonstrably better results than previous methods on a variety of test networks, both real and computer generated.},

Here we point out that weighted networks can in many cases be analyzed using a simple mapping from a weighted network to an unweighted multigraph, allowing us to apply standard techniques for unweighted graphs to weighted ones as well. We give a number of examples of the method, including an algorithm for detecting community structure in weighted networks and a simple proof of the maximum-flow–minimum-cut theorem.},

Frequently cited examples include the cell, a network of chemicals linked by chemical reactions, and the Internet, a network of routers and computers connected by physical links.

This article reviews the recent advances in the field of complex networks, focusing on the statistical mechanics of network topology and dynamics. After reviewing the empirical data that motivated the recent interest in networks, the authors discuss the main models and analytical tools, covering random graphs, small-world and scale-free networks, the emerging theory of evolving networks, and the interplay between topology and the network’s robustness against failures and attacks.},

Similar ideas have been used to construct statistical models of nervous systems, and these have been applied by J. S. Coleman and others to the spread of information and other social phenomena. The study of social networks by anthropologists has been based, knowingly or unknowingly, on the basic notions of graph theory, as has the identification and analysis of social cliques. There is little consensus among mathematicians about terminology, and social scientists have drawn fortuitously on various mathematical vocabularies as well as inventing their own technical terms. Applied to social networks, the words `connectedness' and `connectivity' may refer to properties of the distance between persons, the number of paths between them, whether there is a path at all, or the proportion of possible paths actually in existence. These different usages are contrasted by restating them all in the terminology set out in Structural models (1965) by Harary, Norman and Cartwright.},

	abstract = {Research on social networks has grown considerably in the last decade. However, there is a certain amount of confusion about network theory—for example, what it is, what is distinctive about it, and how to generate new theory. This paper attempts to remedy the situation by clarifying the fundamental concepts of the field (such as the network) and characterizing how network reasoning works. We start by considering the definition of network, noting some confusion caused by two different perspectives, which we refer to as realist and nominalist. We then analyze two well-known network theories, Granovetter's strength of weak ties theory [Granovetter, M. S. 1973. The strength of weak ties. Amer. J. Sociol.78(6) 1360–1380] and Burt's structural holes theory [Burt, R. S. 1992. Structural Holes: The Social Structure of Competition. Havard University Press, Cambridge, {MA}], to identify characteristic elements of network theorizing. We argue that both theories share an underlying theoretical model, which we label the network flow model, from which we derive additional implications. We also discuss network phenomena that do not appear to fit the flow model and discuss the possibility of a second fundamental model, which we call the bond model. We close with a discussion of the merits of model-based network theorizing for facilitating the generation of new theory, as well as a discussion of endogeneity in network theorizing.},

Recently, researchers have become increasingly interested in high-status youth. A distinction is made between two groups of high-status youth: those who are genuinely well liked by their peers and engage in predominantly prosocial behaviors and those who are seen as popular by their peers but are not necessarily well liked. The latter group of youth is well known, socially central, and emulated, but displays a mixed profile of prosocial as well as aggressive and manipulative behaviors. Research now needs to address the distinctive characteristics of these two groups and their developmental precursors and consequences. Of particular interest are high-status and socially powerful aggressors and their impact on their peers. The heterogeneity of high-status youth complicates the understanding of the social dynamics of the peer group, but will lead to new and important insights into the developmental significance of peer relationships.},

Here we lay out fast and stable computations for {LOO} and {WAIC} that can be performed using existing simulation draws. We introduce an efficient computation of {LOO} using Pareto-smoothed importance sampling ({PSIS}), a new procedure for regularizing importance weights. Although {WAIC} is asymptotically equal to {LOO}, we demonstrate that {PSIS}-{LOO} is more robust in the finite case with weak priors or influential observations. As a byproduct of our calculations, we also obtain approximate standard errors for estimated predictive errors and for comparison of predictive errors between two models. We implement the computations in an R package called loo and demonstrate using models fit with the Bayesian inference package Stan.},

Debate about the implementation of informed consent is constricted and polarised, centring on the right of individuals to be fully informed and to freely choose versus an autocratic, paternalistic practice that negates individual choice. A bioethical framework, based on a principle-led form of reductive/deductive reasoning, dominates the current model of informed consent. Such a model tends to abstract the process of consent from its clinical and social setting. By fleshing out the social process involved when patients and healthy volunteer subjects consent to take part in clinical drug trials, this paper attempts to address the problem arising from the current ‘empty ethics’ model. My arguments are substantiated by qualitative interview data drawn from a study I conducted on the process of consent as experienced by participants in clinical drug trials.},

A popular hypothesis states that networks with many clustered ties and a high degree of separation will be less effective for behavioral diffusion than networks in which locally redundant ties are rewired to provide shortcuts across the social space. A competing hypothesis argues that when behaviors require social reinforcement, a network with more clustering may be more advantageous, even if the network as a whole has a larger diameter. I investigated the effects of network structure on diffusion by studying the spread of health behavior through artificially structured online communities. Individual adoption was much more likely when participants received social reinforcement from multiple neighbors in the social network. The behavior spread farther and faster across clustered-lattice networks than across corresponding random networks.
An online experiment shows how network structure affects the spread of health behavior.

	abstract = {All major on-line social networks, such as {MySpace}, Facebook, {LiveJournal}, and Orkut, are built around the concept of friendship. It is not uncommon for a social network participant to have over 100 friends. A natural question arises: are they all real friends of hers, or does she mean something different when she calls them "friends?" Speaking in other words, what is the relationship between off-line (real, traditional) friendship and its on-line (virtual) namesake? In this paper, we use sociological data to suggest that there is a significant difference between the concepts of virtual and real friendships. We further investigate the structure of on-line friendship and observe that it follows the Pareto (or double Pareto) distribution and is subject to age stratification but not to gender segregation. We introduce the concept of digital personality that quantifies the willingness of a social network participant to engage in virtual friendships.},

	abstract = {Background: The coronavirus disease ({COVID}-19) pandemic led to substantial public discussion. Understanding these discussions can help institutions, governments, and individuals navigate the pandemic.
Objective: The aim of this study is to analyze discussions on Twitter related to {COVID}-19 and to investigate the sentiments toward {COVID}-19.
Methods: This study applied machine learning methods in the field of artificial intelligence to analyze data collected from Twitter. Using tweets originating exclusively in the United States and written in English during the 1-month period from March 20 to April 19, 2020, the study examined {COVID}-19–related discussions. Social network and sentiment analyses were also conducted to determine the social network of dominant topics and whether the tweets expressed positive, neutral, or negative sentiments. Geographic analysis of the tweets was also conducted.
Results: There were a total of 14,180,603 likes, 863,411 replies, 3,087,812 retweets, and 641,381 mentions in tweets during the study timeframe. Out of 902,138 tweets analyzed, sentiment analysis classified 434,254 (48.2\%) tweets as having a positive sentiment, 187,042 (20.7\%) as neutral, and 280,842 (31.1\%) as negative. The study identified 5 dominant themes among {COVID}-19–related tweets: health care environment, emotional support, business economy, social change, and psychological stress. Alaska, Wyoming, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, and Florida were the states expressing the most negative sentiment while Vermont, North Dakota, Utah, Colorado, Tennessee, and North Carolina conveyed the most positive sentiment.
Conclusions: This study identified 5 prevalent themes of {COVID}-19 discussion with sentiments ranging from positive to negative. These themes and sentiments can clarify the public’s response to {COVID}-19 and help officials navigate the pandemic.},

Using a statistical physics approach the Internet is viewed as a growing system that evolves in time through the addition and removal of nodes and links. This perspective permits us to outline the dynamical theory required for a description of the macroscopic evolution of the Internet. The presence of such a theoretical framework appears to be a revolutionary and promising path towards our understanding of the Internet and the various processes taking place on this network, including, for example, the spread of computer viruses or resilience to random or intentional damages. This book will be of interest to graduate students and researchers in statistical physics, computer science and mathematics studying in this subject.},

Recently, however, a new Network Science has been developed, providing insights into the emergence of global, system-scale properties in contexts as diverse as the Internet, metabolic reactions, and collaborations among scientists. Today, the inclusion of network theory into Cognitive Sciences, and the expansion of complex-systems science, promises to significantly change the way in which the organization and dynamics of cognitive and behavioral processes are understood. In this paper, we review recent contributions of network theory at different levels and domains within the Cognitive Sciences.},

Thus, we provide multiple types of communication networks expressed in a single, large population with high temporal resolution, and over a period of multiple weeks, a fact which makes the dataset shared here unique.

	abstract = {Many countries have passed their first {COVID}-19 epidemic peak. Traditional epidemiological models describe this as a result of nonpharmaceutical interventions pushing the growth rate below the recovery rate. In this phase of the pandemic many countries showed an almost linear growth of confirmed cases for extended time periods. This new containment regime is hard to explain by traditional models where either infection numbers grow explosively until herd immunity is reached or the epidemic is completely suppressed. Here we offer an explanation of this puzzling observation based on the structure of contact networks. We show that for any given transmission rate there exists a critical number of social contacts, {DcDc}{\textless}mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/{MathML}"{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:msub{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mi{\textgreater}D{\textless}/mml:mi{\textgreater}{\textless}/mml:mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mi{\textgreater}c{\textless}/mml:mi{\textgreater}{\textless}/mml:mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}/mml:msub{\textgreater}{\textless}/mml:math{\textgreater}, below which linear growth and low infection prevalence must occur.

When calibrating our model to empirical estimates of the transmission rate and the number of days being contagious, we find Dc∼7.2Dc∼7.2{\textless}mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/{MathML}"{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:msub{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mi{\textgreater}D{\textless}/mml:mi{\textgreater}{\textless}/mml:mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mi{\textgreater}c{\textless}/mml:mi{\textgreater}{\textless}/mml:mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}/mml:msub{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mo{\textgreater}∼{\textless}/mml:mo{\textgreater}{\textless}mml:mn{\textgreater}7.2{\textless}/mml:mn{\textgreater}{\textless}/mml:math{\textgreater}. Assuming realistic contact networks with a degree of about 5, and assuming that lockdown measures would reduce that to household size (about 2.5), we reproduce actual infection curves with remarkable precision, without fitting or fine-tuning of parameters. In particular, we compare the United States and Austria, as examples for one country that initially did not impose measures and one that responded with a severe lockdown early on. Our findings question the applicability of standard compartmental models to describe the {COVID}-19 containment phase. The probability to observe linear growth in these is practically zero.},

Methods This study employs social network analyses based on 2,864 Twitter users and 2,775 communications of Twitter. Results This study finds that President Trump plays the most important role in social networks among the top 20 key players for both in-degree centrality and content in tweets. Second, Donald Trump and Barak Obama show the opposite result for the in-degree centrality and follower analysis. The result shows that the topic-based networks and the person-based networks play a different role in social networks. This study demonstrates that the presidents, the World Health Organization ({WHO}) and its regional offices, the Centers for Disease Control, and news channels play a crucial role in the news of {COVID}-19 for people. Key players, such as Donald Trump, Barack Obama, and {BBC}, are located in the central networks. In contrast, U.S. news channels and {WHO} and its regional offices have independent channels. Conclusions Governments should understand the characteristics of public key players to provide information for {COVID}-19 in a timely manner.},

	abstract = {Social distancing and isolation have been widely introduced to counter the {COVID}-19 pandemic. Adverse social, psychological and economic consequences of a complete or near-complete lockdown demand the development of more moderate contact-reduction policies. Adopting a social network approach, we evaluate the effectiveness of three distancing strategies designed to keep the curve flat and aid compliance in a post-lockdown world. These are: limiting interaction to a few repeated contacts akin to forming social bubbles; seeking similarity across contacts; and strengthening communities via triadic strategies. We simulate stochastic infection curves incorporating core elements from infection models, ideal-type social network models and statistical relational event models. We demonstrate that a strategic social network-based reduction of contact strongly enhances the effectiveness of social distancing measures while keeping risks lower. We provide scientific evidence for effective social distancing that can be applied in public health messaging and that can mitigate negative consequences of social isolation.},

In addition, the arguments that they use focus on possible harmful effects and the distrust of pharmaceuticals, promoting the use of social networks as a resource for finding health-related information. The anti-vaccine groups are able to use social networks and their resources to increase their number and do so through controversial arguments, such as the economic benefit of pharmaceuticals or personal stories of children to move the population without using reliable or evidence-based content.},

              Background:
              Robots have evolved from continuous human-controlled master–slave servomechanisms for handling nuclear waste to a broad range of robots incorporating artificial intelligence for many applications and under human supervisory control.
            
            
              Methods:
              This mini-review describes {HRI} developments in four application areas and what are the challenges for human factors research.

	abstract = {Abstract
            There is increasing attention given to the concept of trustworthiness for artificial intelligence and robotics. However, trust is highly context-dependent, varies among cultures, and requires reflection on others’ trustworthiness, appraising whether there is enough evidence to conclude that these agents deserve to be trusted. Moreover, little research exists on what happens when too much trust is placed in robots and autonomous systems. Conceptual clarity and a shared framework for approaching overtrust are missing. In this contribution, we offer an overview of pressing topics in the context of overtrust and robots and autonomous systems. Our review mobilizes insights solicited from in-depth conversations from a multidisciplinary workshop on the subject of trust in human–robot interaction ({HRI}), held at a leading robotics conference in 2020. A broad range of participants brought in their expertise, allowing the formulation of a forward-looking research agenda on overtrust and automation biases in robotics and autonomous systems. Key points include the need for multidisciplinary understandings that are situated in an eco-system perspective, the consideration of adjacent concepts such as deception and anthropomorphization, a connection to ongoing legal discussions through the topic of liability, and a socially embedded understanding of overtrust in education and literacy matters. The article integrates diverse literature and provides a ground for common understanding for overtrust in the context of {HRI}.},

Recent meta-analyses focusing on empathy for pain for example reliably identified a network comprising anterior insula and anterior midcingulate cortex. Moreover, recent studies suggest that the generation of empathy is flexibly supported by networks involved in action simulation and mentalizing depending on the information available in the environment. Further, empathic responses are modulated by many factors including the context they occur in. Recent work shows how this modulation can be afforded by the engagement of antagonistic motivational systems or by cognitive control circuits, and these modulatory systems can also be employed in efforts to regulate one's empathic responses.},

Sentiments of users that are expressed on the web has great influence on the readers, product vendors and politicians. The unstructured form of data from the social media is needed to be analyzed and well-structured and for this purpose, sentiment analysis has recognized significant attention. Sentiment analysis is referred as text organization that is used to classify the expressed mind-set or feelings in different manners such as negative, positive, favorable, unfavorable, thumbs up, thumbs down, etc. The challenge for sentiment analysis is lack of sufficient labeled data in the field of Natural Language Processing ({NLP}). And to solve this issue, the sentiment analysis and deep learning techniques have been merged because deep learning models are effective due to their automatic learning capability. This Review Paper highlights latest studies regarding the implementation of deep learning models such as deep neural networks, convolutional neural networks and many more for solving different problems of sentiment analysis such as sentiment classification, cross lingual problems, textual and visual analysis and product review analysis, etc.},

While total childcare is not yet being promoted, there are indications that it is ‘on the cards’. We examine recent research and developments in childcare robots and speculate on progress over the coming years by extrapolating from other ongoing robotics work. Our main aim is to raise ethical questions about the part or full-time replacement of primary carers. The questions are about human rights, privacy, robot use of restraint, deception of children and accountability. But the most pressing ethical issues throughout the paper concern the consequences for the psychological and emotional wellbeing of children. We set these in the context of the child development literature on the pathology and causes of attachment disorders. We then consider the adequacy of current legislation and international ethical guidelines on the protection of children from the overuse of robot care.},

have died due to Breast cancer. However, in the initial stage, the diagnosis of breast cancer
can save women\&\#039;s life. To diagnose cancer in the breast tissues, there are several techniques and
methods. The image processing, machine learning, and deep learning methods and techniques are

detect the breast masses, microcalcifications, and malignant cells,different techniques are used in
the Computer-Aided Diagnosis ({CAD}) systems phases like preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction,
and classification. We have reported a detailed analysis of different techniques or methods
with their usage and performance measurement. From the reported results, it is concluded that for
breast cancer survival, it is essential to improve the methods or techniques to diagnose it at an initial
stage by improving the results of the Computer-Aided Diagnosis systems. Furthermore, segmentation
