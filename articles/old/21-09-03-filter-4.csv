Among the smart objects, the social robot cannot be distinguished by precise and well defined technical or morphological cues. Even though no serious and discriminative attributes can be given by any science knowledge -- even the movement attribute, and the ""autonomous'' cognitive attribute are not clearly defined -- in order to understand how an object becomes, perceptively, a subject (social robot), it is a fact that the automatons and the talking artefacts are now named robot, which is particularly attractive for general public, for scientists and engineers. However, is it a socio-cultural desire or a technical need to add the augmentation of the social space to the ""augmented self'' (self body and self environment abilities)? In this talk we will explore some social space perturbations in ecological conditions, such as elderly people suffering from isolation and interacting with a robot that can emit solely non-verbal speech primitives. Long term interactions were collected and analysed using the concepts of the Dynamic Affective Network for Social Entities (D.A.N.S.E.) theory. We will try to show that non-verbal speech primitives, organised in the D.A.N.S.E.'s ""glue'' paradigm, permit to predict the relations with the robot perceived by elderly as oriented inside or outside dominance, but also to explore in particular an empathic dimension. Through a Living Lab method, evaluation of these hypotheses and building of an empathic socio-affective HRI were conducted together, within strong ethical constraints. In particular the development of frail robots for frail people will be proposed as possible ethical perspective.",0,1,1,0,1,1,conferencePaper,2019,"Aubergé, Véronique",Proceedings of the 9th International on Audio/Visual Emotion Challenge and Workshop,978-1-4503-6913-8,,5UJRNGXU,10.1145/3347320.3357687,https://doi.org/10.1145/3347320.3357687,2019-10-15T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T21:20:47Z,2021-02-15T21:20:47Z,2021-02-15T00:00:00Z,1,,,,,,The Socio-Affective Robot,AVEC '19,,,,Association for Computing Machinery,"New York, NY, USA",,,,,,ACM Digital Library,,,,,,engagement; frail person; hri; living lab; social robot; socio-affective speech,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ACM,the socio-affective robot: aimed to understand human links?,the socioaffective robot aimed to understand human links

As Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are given increasingly sensitive and impactful roles in society, it is important to enable AI to wield empathy as a tool to benefit those it interacts with. In this paper, we work towards this goal by bringing together a number of important concepts: empathy, AI planning, and plan recognition (i.e., the problem of inferring an actor's plan and goal given observations about its behavior). We formalize the notions of Empathetic Planning and Empathetic Plan Recognition which are informed by the beliefs and affective state of the actor, and propose AI planning-based computational approaches.

Experiments with a Health Advice Chatbot,"When we ask a chatbot for advice about a personal problem, should it simply provide informational support and refrain from offering emotional support? Or, should it show sympathy and empathize with our situation? Although expression of caring and understanding is valued in supportive human communications, do we want the same from a chatbot, or do we simply reject it due to its artificiality and uncanniness? To answer this question, we conducted two experiments with a chatbot providing online medical information advice about a sensitive personal issue. In Study 1, participants (N = 158) simply read a dialogue between a chatbot and a human user. In Study 2, participants (N = 88) interacted with a real chatbot. We tested the effect of three types of empathic expression - sympathy, cognitive empathy, and affective empathy - on individuals' perceptions of the service and the chatbot. Data reveal that expression of sympathy and empathy is favored over unemotional provision of advice, in support of the Computers are Social Actors (CASA) paradigm.

Advances in artificial intelligence enable people to perceive the intellectual mind of a robot through their semantic interactions. Conversely, it has been still controversial whether a robot has an affective mind of its own without any intellectual actions or semantic interactions. We investigated pain experiences when observing three different facial expressions of a virtual agent modeling affective minds (i.e., painful, unhappy, and neutral). The cold pain detection threshold of 19 healthy subjects was measured as they watched a black screen, then changes in their cold pain detection thresholds were evaluated as they watched the facial expressions. Subjects were asked to rate the pain intensity from the respective facial expressions. Changes of cold pain detection thresholds were compared and adjusted by the respective pain intensities. Only when watching the painful expression of a virtual agent did, the cold pain detection threshold increase significantly. By directly evaluating intuitive pain responses when observing facial expressions of a virtual agent, we found that we 'share' empathic neural responses, which can be intuitively emerge, according to observed pain intensity with a robot (a virtual agent).",1,1,0,0,0,1,journalArticle,2020,"Sumitani, Mizuho; Osumi, Michihiro; Abe, Hiroaki; Azuma, Kenji; Tsuchida, Rikuhei; Sumitani, Masahiko",Applied Sciences-Basel,,,EQ946ZWH,10.3390/app10186531,,2020-09-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-11T01:55:23Z,2021-02-11T01:55:23Z,,6531,,18,10,,Appl.

Providing appropriate responses by interactive virtual agents requires the ability to perceive users’ emotional states. In this paper, we study and analyze behavioral cues that indicate an opportunity to provide an empathetic response. Emotional tone in language in addition to facial expressions are strong indicators of dramatic sentiment in conversation that warrant an empathetic response. To automatically recognize such instances, we develop a multimodal deep neural network for identifying opportunities when the agent should express positive or negative empathetic responses. We train and evaluate our model using audio, video and language from human-agent interactions in a wizard-of-Oz setting, using the wizard’s empathetic responses and annotations collected on Amazon Mechanical Turk as ground-truth labels. Our model outperforms a text-based baseline achieving F1-score of 0.71 on a three-class classification.

In this study, the communication patterns and prosocial outcomes of interactions with voice assistants were investigated. Children between 5 and 6 years (N ¼ 72) of age solved a treasure hunt in either a human or voice assistant condition. During the treasure hunt, the interaction partner supplied information either about their knowledge of or experience with the objects. Afterwards, chil­ dren were administered a sharing task and a helping task. Results revealed that children provided voice assistants with less information than humans and that only the type of information given by a human interaction partner was related to children’s information selection. Sharing was influenced by an interaction between type of in­ formation and interaction partner, showing that the type of information shared influenced children’s decisions more when interacting with a human, but less when interacting with a voice assistant. Children in all conditions enjoyed the treasure hunt with the interaction partner. Overall, these results suggest that children do not impose the same expectations on voice assistants as they do on humans.

In this regard, human-robot interaction can be improved through the automatic perception of empathy, among other human attributes, allowing robots to affectively adapt their actions to interactants' feelings in any given situation. This paper presents our contribution to the generalised track of the One-Minute Gradual (OMG) Empathy Prediction Challenge by describing our approach to predict a listener's valence during semi-scripted actor-listener interactions. We extract visual and acoustic features from the interactions and feed them into a bidirectional long short-term memory network to capture the time-dependencies of the valence-based empathy during the interactions. Generalised and personalised unimodal and multimodal valence-based empathy models are then trained to assess the impact of each modality on the system performance. Furthermore, we analyse if intra-subject dependencies on empathy perception affect the system performance. We assess the models by computing the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) between the predicted and self-annotated valence scores. The results support the suitability of employing multimodal data to recognise participants' valence-based empathy during the interactions, and highlight the subject-dependency of empathy. In particular, we obtained our best result with a personalised multimodal model, which achieved a CCC of 0.11 on the test set.",1,1,0,0,0,1,conferencePaper,2019,"Mallol-Ragolta, A.; Schmitt, M.; Baird, A.; Cummins, N.; Schuller, B.",2019 14th IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face Gesture Recognition (FG 2019),,,6HMCSB64,10.1109/FG.2019.8756517,,2019-05-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-11T03:17:10Z,2021-02-11T03:17:10Z,,1-5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IEEE Xplore,,,,,,feature extraction; emotion recognition; human-robot interaction; actor-listener interactions; bidirectional long short-term memory network; CCC; concordance correlation coefficient; empathy perception; interpersonal relationships; intra-subject dependencies; multimodal valence-based empathy models; OMG; one-minute gradual; personalised multimodal model; unimodal valence-based empathy models; valence-based empathy recognition; visual feature extraction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2019 14th IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face Gesture Recognition (FG 2019),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IEEE Xplore,performance analysis of unimodal and multimodal models in valence-based empathy recognition,performance analysis of unimodal and multimodal models in valencebased empathy recognition

Here we present our progress toward building artificial agents with such abilities. We implemented a perspective taking task inspired by experiments done with chimpanzees. We show that agents controlled by artificial neural networks can learn via reinforcement learning to pass simple tests that require some aspects of perspective taking capabilities. We studied whether this ability is more readily learned by agents with information encoded in allocentric or egocentric form for both their visual perception and motor actions.

One approach is using a dialogue strategy in which the robot makes a remark based on previous dialogues with users.

This dialogue strategy can improve the sense of conversation, which results in increased interest while avoiding the privacy issue. We examined our proposal by conducting a conversation experiment evaluated by subject impressions. The results demonstrated that the proposed method could help the robot to obtain higher evaluations.

The system relies on the learning by teaching paradigm to build an interaction, so as to stimulate meta-cognition, empathy and increased self-esteem in the child user. We hypothesise that use of a humanoid robot in such a system could not just engage an unmotivated student, but could also present the opportunity for children to experience physically-induced benefits encountered during human-led handwriting interventions, such as motor mimicry. By leveraging simulated handwriting on a synchronised tablet display, a NAO humanoid robot with limited fine motor capabilities has been configured as a suitably embodied handwriting partner. Statistical shape models derived from principal component analysis of a dataset of adult-written letter trajectories allow the robot to draw purposefully deformed letters. By incorporating feedback from user demonstrations, the system is then able to learn the optimal parameters for the appropriate shape models. Preliminary in situ studies have been conducted with primary school classes to obtain insight into children's use of the novel system. Children aged 6-8 successfully engaged with the robot and improved its writing to a level which they were satisfied with.

A useful thought experiment is the application of the Turing test to user-facing artificial intelligence systems in health care (such as chatbots or conversational agents). In this paper I argue that many medical decisions require value judgements and the doctor-patient relationship requires empathy and understanding to arrive at a shared decision, often handling large areas of uncertainty and balancing competing risks. Arguably, medicine requires wisdom more than intelligence, artificial or otherwise. Artificial intelligence therefore needs to supplement rather than replace medical professionals, and identifying the complementary positioning of artificial intelligence in medical consultation is a key challenge for the future.

Head motion synchrony analysis revealed a leader-follower relationship for the reactive model and a mutual entrainment of head motion for the interactive model. Also, questionnaire survey results showed the degree of empathy for interactive condition was significantly higher as compared with reactive and unreactive conditions. In addition, the degree of naturalness for interactive condition was significantly higher as compared with unreactive condition. Hence, these indicate that empathy was shared through mutual entrainment of head motion, which could provide a smooth interface in human-robot communication.

Whereas some robots use faces to display (simplified) emotional expressions, for other robots such as Nao, body language is the best medium available given their inability to convey facial expressions. Displaying emotional body language that can be interpreted whilst interacting with the robot should significantly improve naturalness. This research investigates the creation of an affect space for the generation of emotional body language to be displayed by humanoid robots. To do so, three experiments investigating how emotional body language displayed by agents is interpreted were conducted. The first experiment compared the interpretation of emotional body language displayed by humans and agents. The results showed that emotional body language displayed by an agent or a human is interpreted in a similar way in terms of recognition. Following these results, emotional key poses were extracted from an actor's performances and implemented in a Nao robot. The interpretation of these key poses was validated in a second study where it was found that participants were better than chance at interpreting the key poses displayed. Finally, an affect space was generated by blending key poses and validated in a third study. Overall, these experiments confirmed that body language is an appropriate medium for robots to display emotions and suggest that an affect space for body expressions can be used to improve the expressiveness of humanoid robots.",,1,0,0,,1,journalArticle,2012,"Beck, Aryel; Stevens, Brett; Bard, Kim A.; Cañamero, Lola",ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems,,2160-6455,PG9DLAZL,10.1145/2133366.2133368,https://doi.org/10.1145/2133366.2133368,2012-03-20T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T21:19:32Z,2021-02-15T21:19:32Z,2021-02-15T21:19:32Z,2:1–2:29,,1,2,,ACM Trans.

Automated technologies are finding themselves more and more integrated into every aspect of the fight. As technology continues to advance, the United States Military must consider what a human-machine team will look like and how an optimal relationship between the two assets can be formed, especially under the stressful conditions that often characterize military contexts. For a human-machine team in a military context to work at maximum efficiency, an ideal level of empathy towards an automated teammate must be obtained. The goal of this study is to determine the effect stress can have on an individual's empathetic reaction toward a Pepper robot. Twenty-eight participants interacted with a Pepper robot either under stress or not. Empathy toward the robot was measured through subjective assessments as well as by participant decisions to continue interacting with Pepper even though doing so would harm the robot. Although not conclusive, the results suggest an interaction between participant gender and stress on empathy toward the Pepper robot. Women showed more empathy toward Pepper under higher levels of stress than lower levels of stress. However, the opposite was true for men. Men showed less empathy toward Pepper under higher levels of stress.

We address two research questions: (1) Can an autonomous robot designed with empathic competencies foster collaborative learning in a group context? (2) Can an empathic robot sustain positive educational outcomes in long-term collaborative learning interactions with groups of students? To answer these questions, we developed an autonomous robot with empathic competencies that is able to interact with a group of students in a learning activity about sustainable development. Two studies were conducted. The first study compares learning outcomes in children across three conditions: learning with an empathic robot; learning with a robot without empathic capabilities; and learning without a robot. The results show that the autonomous robot with empathy fosters meaningful discussions about sustainability, which is a learning outcome in sustainability education. The second study features groups of students who interact with the robot in a school classroom for 2 months. The long-term educational interaction did not seem to provide significant learning gains, although there was a change in game-actions to achieve more sustainability during game-play.

One such problem of particular importance is the low accuracy of predictions. This paper suggests that users' help is a practical approach to improve accuracy and it considers four factors that trigger users' willingness to help for an imperfect AI system. The two factors covered in Study 1 are utilitarian benefit based on egoistic motivation, and empathy based on altruistic motivation. In Study 2, utilitarian benefit is divided into explainable AI and monetary reward. The results indicate that two variables, namely empathy and monetary reward, have significant positive effects on willingness to help, and monetary reward is the strongest stimulus. In addition, explainable AI is shown to be positively associated with trust in AI. This study applies social studies of help motivation to the HCI field in order to induce users' willingness to help for an imperfect AI.

Using a non-anthropomorphic social robot and a simple counting game, we examine the effects that empathy-generating robot dialogue has on participant performance across three conditions. In the self-directed condition, the robot petitions the participant to reduce his or her performance so that the robot can avoid punishment. In the externally-directed condition, the robot petitions on behalf of its programmer so that its programmer can avoid punishment. The control condition does not involve any petitions for empathy. We find that externally-directed petitions from the robot show a higher likelihood of motivating the participant to sacrifice his or her own performance to help, at the expense of incurring negative social effects.

However, artificial general intelligence (AGI) agents can find undesirable ways of maximising any prior reward function. Therefore, value learning is crucial for safe AGI. We assume that generalised states of the world are valuable - not rewards themselves, and propose an extension of AIXI, in which rewards are used only to bootstrap hierarchical value learning. The modified AIXI agent is considered in the multi-agent environment, where other agents can be either humans or other 'mature' agents, the values of which should be revealed and adopted by the 'infant' AGI agent. Ageneral framework for designing such empathic agent with ethical bias is proposed as an extension of the universal intelligence model as well.

Yet space exploration is costly, and the awaiting environment challenges us with extreme cold, heat, vacuum and radiation, unlike anything encountered on Earth. Thus, the few pioneers who experience it needed to be well protected throughout their spaceflight. The resulting isolation heightens the senses and increases the desire to make humanly connections with any other perceived manifestation of life. Such connections may occur via sensory inputs, namely vision, touch, sound, smell, and taste. This then follows the process of sensing, interpreting, and recognizing familiar patterns, or learning from new experiences. The desire to connect could even transfer to observed objects, if their movements and characteristics trigger the appropriate desires from the observer. When ordered in a familiar way, for example visual stimuli from lights and movements of an object, it may create a perceived real bond with an observer, and evoke the feeling of surprise when the expected behavior changes to something no longer predictable or recognizable. These behavior patterns can be designed into an object and performed autonomously in front of an observer, in our case an astronaut. The experience may introduce multiple responses, including communication, connection, empathy, order, and disorder. While emotions are clearly evoked in the observer and may seem one sided, in effect the object itself provides a decoupled bond, connectivity and communication between the observer and the artist-designer of the object. In this paper we will discuss examples from the field of arts and other domains, including robotics, where human perception through object interaction was explored, and investigate the starting point for new innovative design concepts and future prototype designs, that extend these experiences beyond the boundaries of Earth, while taking advantage of remoteness and the zero gravity environment. Through a form of emotional connection and design, these concepts will focus on the connection and brief emotional bond between a humanly animate object in space and a co-located observer in spaceflight. We conclude that beyond providing creative expressions for humanly contacts, these experiences may also provide further insights into human perception in spaceflight, and could be tested on the International Space Station, and serve as a stepping-stone towards use on long-duration spaceflight to Mars.",,0,0,1,0,0,journalArticle,2015,"Balint, Tibor S.; Hall, Ashley",Acta Astronautica,,0094-5765,WRJQJ2TN,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actaastro.2015.01.010,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094576515000144,2015-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T21:45:53Z,2021-02-15T21:45:53Z,,129-144,,,110,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>Dynamics and Control of Space Systems</p>,,Perception; Cognition; Affordances; Design; Art; Cybernetics; Tacit-knowledge,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Science Direct,humanly space objects—perception and connection with the observer,humanly space objectsperception and connection with the observer

These internal emotions act as motivation for learning to respond to the user in different situations, using the physical capabilities of the robot. This paper proposes a deep hybrid neural model for multi-modal affect recognition, analysis and behaviour modelling in social robots.

Roboticists and ethicists have begun to think carefully about the moral decision making apparatus for machines. Their concerns often center around the plausible claim that robots will lack many of the mental capacities that are indispensable in human moral decision making, such as empathy. To the extent that robots may be robustly artificially intelligent, these concerns subside, but they give way to new worries about creating artificial agents to do our bidding, if those artificial agents have moral standing.

A model of empathy in engineering as a core skill, as a practice orientation and a professional way of being that can be taught in university programs has been proposed [1]. Does an emotional intelligence model of empathy need to be taught earlier than at the university level? The engineering design process has been included in the science standards for k-12 schools since 2013[2]. One of the purposes of this inclusion is the ability to reach a diverse population of students by applying real world problems in their curriculum. The design process typically includes the steps of defining the engineering problem, developing solutions and optimizing the design. Although the word “empathy” is not used, these problems are defined from an empathetic perspective as “situations people want to change” of “social and global significance.” However, the standards do not discuss how to define a problem or how to teach empathy. In the winter of 2016 a study was conducted to evaluate the influence of empathy-based lessons on girls' interest in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). Some information is known about empathy in lessons. Girls may be more interested if lessons are altered to include an element of caring [3]. Other studies indicate children's empathy increases with type of media provided in lesson (computer versus robot) [4]. The study in this article was a qualitative case study of 50 children, grades 6, 7, and 8, boys and girls in an after-school 4-H Science Club. The lessons were conducted once per week. The lessons were previously conducted in an all-girls after-school STEM program with similar available inexpensive materials. Both schools had similar demographics. The students and coordinators(instructors) were observed, pre- and post-surveys were conducted, and interviews of both students and coordinators were audio and/or video-taped. Although responses varied by lesson, initial results indicate many students and coordinators did not understand the meaning of empathy situated in engineering design.",,0,0,0,0,0,conferencePaper,2017,"Burns, H.

This is a common scenario in modern computer games, where players interact with NPCs assuming the guise of human characters. To explore this question, an online game was developed in which a human player had a primary objective of surviving against increasingly difficult waves of enemies. As a secondary objective, the player was tasked with protecting an unarmed NPC companion which assumed either a human, or non-human identity, but with identical underlying Artificial Intelligence. The intention was to explore whether the human player would be more or less protective of a synthetic companion simply due to the identity assumed. The results of the study demonstrate that player's behavior does change based on identity, and clearly indicates that the player was more protective of the companion assuming a human identity. Furthermore, the results show that this phenomenon extends beyond simple human and non-human identities, and that the specific persona, or gender of the NPC may influence the player's empathy towards it.",,1,0,0,0,1,conferencePaper,2015,"Headleand, C.

An understanding of emotional interactions would be essential to such robots’ behavior. To improve the cognitive and behavior systems of such robots, we propose the use of an artiﬁcial topological consciousness that uses a synthetic neurotransmitter and motivation, including a biologically inspired emotion system. A fundamental aspect of a companion robot is a crosscommunication system that enables natural interactions between humans and the robot. This paper focuses on three points in the development of our proposed framework: (1) the organization of the behavior including inside-state emotion regarding the phylogenetic consciousness-based architecture; (2) a method whereby the robot can have empathy toward its human user’s expressions of emotion; and (3) a method that enables the robot to select a facial expression in response to the human user, providing instant human-like ‘emotion’ and based on emotional intelligence (EI) that uses a biologically inspired topological online method to express, for example, encouragement or being delighted.

However, inappropriate communication of self- tracking results might cause the opposite effect. Subtle self- tracking feedback is an alternative that can be provided with the aid of an artificial agent representing the self. Hence, we propose a wearable pet that reflects the user's affective states through visual and haptic feedback. By eliciting empathy and fostering helping behaviors towards it, users would indirectly help themselves. A wearable prototype was built, and three user studies performed to evaluate the appropriateness of the proposed affective representations. Visual representations using facial and body cues were clear for valence and less clear for arousal. Haptic interoceptive patterns emulating heart-rate levels matched the desired feedback urgency levels with a saturation frequency. The integrated visuo-haptic representations matched to participants own affective experience.

In our work, emotional alignment is realized by endowing a virtual human with the ability to empathize. Recent research shows that humans empathize with each other to different degrees depending on several factors including, among others, their mood, their personality, and their social relationships. Although providing virtual humans with features like affect, personality, and the ability to build social relationships, little attention has been devoted to the role of such features as factors modulating their empathic behavior. Supported by psychological models of empathy, we propose an approach to model empathy for the virtual human EMMA—an Empathic MultiModal Agent—consisting of three processing steps: First, the Empathy Mechanism by which an empathic emotion is produced. Second, the Empathy Modulation by which the empathic emotion is modulated. Third, the Expression of Empathy by which EMMA’s multiple modalities are triggered through the modulated empathic emotion.

As humans anthropomorphize robots, an empathetically interacting robot is expected to increase the level of acceptance of social robots. Here, a human perception experiment evaluates whether human subjects perceive empathy in robot speech. For this experiment, empathy is expressed only by adding appropriate emotions to the words in speech. Also, humans' preferences for a robot interacting with empathetic speech versus a standard robotic voice are also assessed. The results show that humans are able to perceive empathy and emotions in robot speech, and prefer it over the standard robotic voice. It is important for the emotions in empathetic speech to be consistent with the language content of what is being said, and with the human users' emotional state.

In this article, this hypothesis is argued from several viewpoints towards its verification. A developmental process of empathy, morality, and ethics based on the mirror neuron system (MNS) that promotes the emergence of the concept of self (and others) scaffolds the emergence of artificial minds. Firstly, an outline of the ideological background on issues of the mind in a broad sense is shown, followed by the limitation of the current progress of artificial intelligence (AI), focusing on deep learning. Next, artificial pain is introduced, along with its architectures in the early stage of self-inflicted experiences of pain, and later, in the sharing stage of the pain between self and others. Then, cognitive developmental robotics (CDR) is revisited for two important concepts&mdash;physical embodiment and social interaction, both of which help to shape conscious minds. Following the working hypothesis, existing studies of CDR are briefly introduced and missing issues are indicated. Finally, the issue of how robots (artificial systems) could be moral agents is addressed.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2019,"Asada, Minoru",Philosophies,,,4HZPD964,10.3390/philosophies4030038,https://www.mdpi.com/2409-9287/4/3/38,2019-09-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-11T01:16:28Z,2021-02-11T01:16:28Z,2021-02-11T01:16:28Z,38,,3,4,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,www.mdpi.com,,Number: 3 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,,,,pain; empathy; mirror neuron system (MNS); morality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WorldCat,"artificial pain may induce empathy, morality, and ethics in the conscious mind of robots",artificial pain may induce empathy morality and ethics in the conscious mind of robots

Such robots, which emulate the emotive, perceptual, and empathic abilities of human teachers, are capable of replicating some of the benefits of one-on-one tutoring from human teachers, in part by leveraging individual student's behavior and task performance data to infer sophisticated models of their knowledge. These student models are then used to provide personalized educational experiences by, for example, determining the optimal sequencing of curricular material. In this paper we introduce an integrated system for autonomously analyzing and assessing children's speech and pronunciation in the context of an interactive word game between a social robot and a child. We present a novel game environment and its computational formulation, an integrated pipeline for capturing and analyzing children's speech in real-time, and an autonomous robot that models children's word pronunciation via Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), augmented with an Active Learning protocol that informs the robot's behavior. We show that the system is capable of autonomously assessing children's pronunciation ability, with ground truth determined by a post-experiment evaluation by human raters. We also compare phoneme- and word-level GPR models and discuss trade-offs of each approach in modeling children's pronunciation.

In this paper, we propose an incremental learning model for selecting the user's representative or habitual emotional behaviors which place emphasis on individual users' cultural traits identified through long term interaction. Furthermore, a transformation model is proposed to convert the obtained emotional behaviors into a specific robot's motion space. To validate the proposed approach, the models were evaluated by two example scenarios of interaction. The experimental results confirmed that the proposed approach endows a social robot with the capability to learn emotional behaviors from individual users, and to generate its emotional bodily expressions.

A major critique concerns the commercial design of digital technologies that engenders compulsive behavior. All technologies affect humans in a reciprocal way. The new digital technologies-from smartphones to the Internet—where humans are tethered to machines, can impair our autonomy, hijack attention, rewire the brain, and diminish concentration, empathy, knowledge, and wisdom.

As the breath of robots applications requiring human interaction grow, it is important for robots to acquire sophisticated social skills such as empathy towards pain. However, it turns out that this is difficult to achieve without having an appropriate concept of pain that relies on robots being aware of their own body machinery aspects. This paper introduces the concept of pain, based on the ability to develop a state of awareness of robots own body and the use of the fault detection approach to generate artificial robot pain. Faults provide the stimulus and defines a classified magnitude value, which constitutes artificial pain generation, comprised of synthetic pain classes. Our experiment evaluates some of synthetic pain classes and the results show that the robot gains awareness of its internal state through its ability to predict its joint motion and generate appropriate artificial pain.

Still, explanations as to why slightly imperfect human-like characters can evoke feelings of eeriness remain the subject of controversy. Many experiments exploring the phenomenon have emphasized speciﬁc visual factors in connection to evolutionary psychological theories or an underlying categorization conﬂict. More recently, studies have also shifted away focus from the appearance of human-like entities, instead exploring their mental capabilities as basis for observers’ discomfort. In order to advance this perspective, we introduced 92 participants to a virtual reality (VR) chat program and presented them with two digital characters engaged in an emotional and empathic dialogue. Using the same prerecorded 3D scene, we manipulated the perceived control type of the depicted characters (humancontrolled avatars vs. computer-controlled agents), as well as their alleged level of autonomy (scripted vs. self-directed actions). Statistical analyses revealed that participants experienced signiﬁcantly stronger eeriness if they perceived the empathic characters to be autonomous artiﬁcial intelligences. As human likeness and attractiveness ratings did not result in signiﬁcant group differences, we present our results as evidence for an ‘‘uncanny valley of mind‘‘ that relies on the attribution of emotions and social cognition to non-human entities.

This agent can be enhanced using a body language called “unazuki” in Japanese, a kind of “nodding” to greatly promote dialogue, often accompanying “un-un” (meaning “exactly”) of Japanese onomatopoeia. This body language is expected to significantly help represent empathy or entire approval. In this paper, the agent is integrated with such a “unazuki” or “dialog promotion nodding” robot to continue the conversation naturally or context respectfully towards clients' further reflection. To realize such “unazuki”, the robot nods twice at each end of dialog sentence input by clients. Here, we introduce our newly developed robot that behaves human-like by an appropriate nodding behavior.

Therefore, we proposed a counseling agent (CA) called CRECA (context respectful counseling agent), which listens to clients and promotes their reflection context respectfully namely in a context preserving way. This agent is now enhanced using a body language called ""unazuki"" in Japanese, a kind of nodding to greatly promote dialogue, often accompanying ""un-un"" (meaning ""exactly"") of Japanese onomatopoeia. This body language significantly helps represent empathy or entire approval. Our agent is enhanced with such dialog promotion nodding robot to continue the conversation naturally or context respectfully towards clients' further reflection. To realize it, the robot nods twice at each end of dialog sentence input by clients. Here, we introduce a robot that behaves human-like by an appropriate nodding behavior. The motivation for such a more human-like robot was the extension of application fields from IT workers' counselling to people, who suffer from more social problems such as financial debt, or anxiety of victory or defeat. For such applications, it is important that the agent behaves as much as possible human-like. Here, we present an enhanced experimental evaluation. The quantitative evaluation is based on the utterance amounts of a test group of individuals. These amount with and without the nodding feature are compared. Additionally, the robots with and without nodding are compared.",,1,0,0,0,1,conferencePaper,2018,"Kurashige, K.; Tsuruta, S.; Sakurai, E.; Sakurai, Y.; Knauf, R.; Damiani, E.; Kutics, A.","2018 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)",,,3TCX3P9X,10.1109/SMC.2018.00297,,2018-10-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-11T03:17:51Z,2021-02-11T03:17:51Z,,1716-1722,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IEEE Xplore,,ISSN: 2577-1655,,,,human-robot interaction; natural language processing; psychology; human factors; Robot sensing systems; interactive systems; Robot; body language; appropriate nodding behavior; context preserving way; context respectful counseling agent; Counseling; counseling robot implementation; CRECA; Dialog Promotion; dialog promotion nodding; dialog sentence input; Dictionaries; employee welfare; Employee welfare; enhanced experimental evaluation; industrial psychology; Japanese onomatopoeia; Natural languages; Nodding; nodding feature; occupational stress; Ontologies; psychological distress; quantitative evaluation; Reflection; reflection context; robot implementation; robot nods; unazuki; workers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2018 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IEEE Xplore,counseling robot implementation and evaluation,counseling robot implementation and evaluation

In this article in order to analyze human behaviors in social context, we propose a new approach which explores interrelations between body part motions in scenarios with people doing a conversation. The novelty of this method is that we analyze body motion-based features in frequency domain to estimate different human social patterns: Interpersonal Behaviors (IBs) and a Social Role (SR). To analyze the dynamics and interrelations of people's body motions, a human movement descriptor is used to extract discriminative features, and a multi-layer Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) technique is proposed to model the existent dependencies. Laban Movement Analysis (LMA) is a well-known human movement descriptor, which provides efficient mid-level information of human body motions. The mid-level information is useful to extract the complex interdependencies. The DBN technique is tested in different scenarios to model the mentioned complex dependencies. The study is applied for obtaining four IBs (Interest, Indicator, Empathy and Emphasis) to estimate one SR (Leading).The obtained results give a good indication of the capabilities of the proposed approach for people interaction analysis with potential applications in human-robot interaction.",,1,0,0,0,1,journalArticle,2016,"Roudposhti, K.

To determine their influence on empathy of a human towards a robot and perceived subjective performance, an experimental setup is created, in which participants engage in a dialog with the robot head EDDIE. The web-based gaming application “Akinator” serves as a backbone for the dialog structure. In this game, the robot tries to guess a thought-of person chosen by the human by asking various questions about the person. In our experimental evaluation, the robot reacts in various ways to the human's facial expressions, either ignoring them, mirroring them, or displaying its own facial expression based on a psychological model for social awareness. In which way this robot behavior influences human perception of the interaction is investigated by a questionnaire. Our results support the hypothesis that the robot behavior during interaction heavily influences the extent of empathy by a human towards a robot and perceived subjective task-performance, with the adaptive modes clearly leading compared to the non-adaptive mode.",,1,0,0,0,1,conferencePaper,2011,"Gonsior, B.; Sosnowski, S.; Mayer, C.; Blume, J.; Radig, B.; Wollherr, D.; Kühnlenz, K.",2011 RO-MAN,,,PICWCQ4D,10.1109/ROMAN.2011.6005294,,2007-11-20T00:00:00Z,2021-02-11T03:17:10Z,2021-02-11T03:17:10Z,,350-356,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IEEE Xplore,,ISSN: 1944-9437,,,,human-robot interaction; Computers; Robots; computer games; control engineering computing; face recognition; robot vision; Speech; Actuators; Akinator Web-based gaming application; EDDIE robot head; HRI empathy performance; HRI subjective performance; human facial expression; Loudspeakers; Microphones; Neck; social awareness psychological model,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2011 RO-MAN,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IEEE Xplore,improving aspects of empathy and subjective performance for hri through mirroring facial expressions,improving aspects of empathy and subjective performance for hri through mirroring facial expressions

In the past few years, there has been a surge of research into various newer areas. The present article looks at the non-neurobiological and non-cognitive theories regarding this complex phenomenon, especially ones that self-psychology, self-theory, artificial intelligence, quantum physics, visual cognitive science and philosophy have to offer. Self-psychology has proposed the need to understand the self and its development, and the ramifications of the self for morality and empathy, which will help us understand consciousness better. There have been inroads made from the fields of computer science, machine technology and artificial intelligence, including robotics, into understanding the consciousness of these machines and their implications for human consciousness. These areas are explored. Visual cortex and emotional theories along with their implications are discussed. The phylogeny and evolution of the phenomenon of consciousness is also highlighted, with theories on the emergence of consciousness in fetal and neonatal life. Quantum physics and its insights into the mind, along with the implications of consciousness and physics and their interface are debated. The role of neurophilosophy to understand human consciousness, the functions of such a concept, embodiment, the dark side of consciousness, future research needs and limitations of a scientific theory of consciousness complete the review. The importance and salient features of each theory are discussed along with certain pitfalls, if present.

Novel solutions are needed so as to help ageing workers maintain workability and productivity, along with a balance between work and personal life, which supports them into good quality of life, active and healthy ageing. In this line, the ""[email protected]"" project, initiated by the European Union, develops a novel ICT-based, personalized system to support ageing workers (aged 50+) into designing fit for purpose work environments and managing flexibly their evolving needs. On top of personalized, dynamically adapted worker and workplace models, computational intelligence will assess user specificities and needs i.r.t. work conditions, both in terms of ergonomics, health and safety issues and task assignments. Recommendations will then be provided both to the worker and company, under strict privacy restrictions, on how the working conditions must adapt. The worker models will be populated by unobtrusive worker sensing, both at work, at home and on the move. To foster workability and productivity, personalized, intuitive, age-friendly productivity, co-design enhancement tools will be developed, including ones for AR/VR-based context-awareness and telepresence, lifelong learning and knowledge sharing. On top of these, a novel Ambient Virtual Coach (AVC) will encompass an empathic mirroring avatar for subtle notifications provision, an adaptive Visual Analytics - based personal dashboard, and a reward-based motivation system targeting positive and balanced worker behavior at work and personal life, towards a novel paradigm of ambient support into workability and well-being.

It is as much a threat to the viability of online social networks for youth today as spam once was to email in the early days of the Internet. Current work to tackle this problem has involved social and psychological studies on its prevalence as well as its negative effects on adolescents. While true solutions rest on teaching youth to have healthy personal relationships, few have considered innovative design of social network software as a tool for mitigating this problem. Mitigating cyberbullying involves two key components: robust techniques for effective detection and reflective user interfaces that encourage users to reflect upon their behavior and their choices. Spam filters have been successful by applying statistical approaches like Bayesian networks and hidden Markov models. They can, like Google’s GMail, aggregate human spam judgments because spam is sent nearly identically to many people. Bullying is more personalized, varied, and contextual. In this work, we present an approach for bullying detection based on state-of-the-art natural language processing and a common sense knowledge base, which permits recognition over a broad spectrum of topics in everyday life. We analyze a more narrow range of particular subject matter associated with bullying (e.g. appearance, intelligence, racial and ethnic slurs, social acceptance, and rejection), and construct BullySpace, a common sense knowledge base that encodes particular knowledge about bullying situations. We then perform joint reasoning with common sense knowledge about a wide range of everyday life topics. We analyze messages using our novel AnalogySpace common sense reasoning technique. We also take into account social network analysis and other factors. We evaluate the model on real-world instances that have been reported by users on Formspring, a social networking website that is popular with teenagers. On the intervention side, we explore a set of reflective user-interaction paradigms with the goal of promoting empathy among social network participants. We propose an “air traffic control”-like dashboard, which alerts moderators to large-scale outbreaks that appear to be escalating or spreading and helps them prioritize the current deluge of user complaints. For potential victims, we provide educational material that informs them about how to cope with the situation, and connects them with emotional support from others. A user evaluation shows that in-context, targeted, and dynamic help during cyberbullying situations fosters end-user reflection that promotes better coping strategies.",,0,0,0,,0,journalArticle,2012,"Dinakar, Karthik; Jones, Birago; Havasi, Catherine; Lieberman, Henry; Picard, Rosalind",ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems,,2160-6455,5IQPLR8J,10.1145/2362394.2362400,https://doi.org/10.1145/2362394.2362400,2012-09-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T21:25:58Z,2021-02-15T21:25:58Z,2021-02-15T21:25:55Z,18:1–18:30,,3,2,,ACM Trans.

If we aim to build artificial companions (agents or robots) capable of establishing long-term relationships with users, they should be able to understand the user's affective state and react accordingly, that is, behave in an empathic manner. Recent advances in affect recognition research show that it is possible to automatically analyse and interpret affective expressions displayed by humans. However, affect recognition in naturalistic environments is still a challenging issue and there are many unanswered questions related to how a virtual agent or a social robot should react to those states, and how that improves the interaction. We have developed a scenario in which a social robot recognises the user's affective state and displays empathic behaviours.

We propose EmotoTent as a core element of a K-6 socio-emotional learning curriculum designed to improve school culture through the enhancement of children's ability to regulate emotions and interact with human and non-human species with empathy and compassion. Enhancing these qualities has been shown to lead to reductions in violence and bullying, racism, gender inequality and other forms of marginalization.

The aim of this paper is to study if a machine learning system can recognize animal emotions, starting from dogs’ basic emotions of joy and anger, and to investigate the opportunity of future applications concerning systems of prosthetic knowledge to help people without the proper experience or capability to understand animals aggressivity or friendliness, or for supportive systems in Artificial Intelligence.",0,1,0,0,,1,conferencePaper,2019,"Franzoni, Valentina; Milani, Alfredo; Biondi, Giulio; Micheli, Francesco",IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Web Intelligence - Companion Volume,978-1-4503-6988-6,,GZC7HT38,10.1145/3358695.3361750,https://doi.org/10.1145/3358695.3361750,2019-10-14T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T21:25:58Z,2021-02-15T21:25:58Z,2021-02-15T00:00:00Z,91–96,,,,,,,WI '19 Companion,,,,Association for Computing Machinery,"New York, NY, USA",,,,,,ACM Digital Library,,,,,,Affective Computing; Artificial Intelligence; Emotion Recognition; Neural Networks; Transfer Learning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ACM,a preliminary work on dog emotion recognition,a preliminary work on dog emotion recognition
,,,,,,,,1,,Artificial Empathic Memory: Enabling Media Technologies to Better Understand Subjective User Experience,"An essential part of being an individual is our personal history, in particular our episodic memories. Episodic memories revolve around events that took place in a person's past and are typically defined by a time, place, emotional associations, and other contextual information. They form an important driver for our emotional and cognitive interpretation of what is currently happening. This includes interactions with media technologies. However, current approaches for personalizing interactions with these technologies are neither aware of what episodic memories are triggered in users, nor of their emotional interpretations of those memories. We argue that this is a serious limitation, because it prevents applications from correctly estimating users' experiences. In short, such technologies lack empathy. In this position paper, we argue that media technologies need an Artificial Empathic Memory (AEM) of their users to address this issue. We propose a psychologically inspired architecture, examine the challenges to be solved, and highlight how existing research can become a starting point for overcoming them.",1,0,"0,5",0,,0,conferencePaper,2018,"Dudzik, Bernd; Hung, Hayley; Neerincx, Mark; Broekens, Joost","Proceedings of the 2018 Workshop on Understanding Subjective Attributes of Data, with the Focus on Evoked Emotions",978-1-4503-5978-8,,TI9V22TG,10.1145/3267799.3267801,https://doi.org/10.1145/3267799.3267801,2018-10-15T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T21:25:58Z,2021-02-15T21:25:58Z,2021-02-15T00:00:00Z,1–8,,,,,,Artificial Empathic Memory,EE-USAD'18,,,,Association for Computing Machinery,"New York, NY, USA",,,,,,ACM Digital Library,,,,,,affective computing; empathic technology; episodic memory; media-evoked emotions; personalization; user modeling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ACM,artificial empathic memory: enabling media technologies to better understand subjective user experience,artificial empathic memory enabling media technologies to better understand subjective user experience
,,,,,,,,1,,Toward Automated Evaluation of Empathetic Responses in Virtual Human Interaction Systems for Mental Health Scenarios,"This paper investigates the process of automating the evaluation of empathetic response levels in virtual human interaction systems implementing mental health scenarios. Two suicidal virtual patients were developed to collect clinician participants' empathetic responses. Before collecting clinicians' responses, we tested the virtual human interaction with healthcare trainees. Trainees' empathetic responses were evaluated by experts to use the ECCS scale based on the ECCS level (Empathetic Communication Coding System). We trained classifiers using trainees' empathetic responses with experts' coded empathy levels as the training dataset. Clinician participants' empathetic responses to virtual patients were evaluated by experts and the classifiers. The performance of the classifiers was evaluated using the experts' coded level of clinicians' empathetic responses as a test dataset. This work demonstrates the applicability of using virtual agents techniques to identify empathy levels of clinicians' responses automatically. This work shows the potential of using virtual human interaction to train clinicians' skills to show empathy. Corresponding feedback could be provided to clinicians based on the evaluation results. We hope this study motivates more research in using intelligent virtual agents in personal skills training in education.",0,1,0,0,,1,conferencePaper,2020,"Yao, Heng; de Siqueira, Alexandre Gomes; Foster, Adriana; Galynker, Igor; Lok, Benjamin",Proceedings of the 20th ACM International Conference on Intelligent Virtual Agents,978-1-4503-7586-3,,QHYA7364,10.1145/3383652.3423916,https://doi.org/10.1145/3383652.3423916,2020-10-20T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T21:25:58Z,2021-02-15T21:25:58Z,2021-02-15T00:00:00Z,1–8,,,,,,,IVA '20,,,,Association for Computing Machinery,"New York, NY, USA",,,,,,ACM Digital Library,,,,,,automated evaluation; empathetic response; suicidal virtual patient,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ACM,toward automated evaluation of empathetic responses in virtual human interaction systems for mental health scenarios,toward automated evaluation of empathetic responses in virtual human interaction systems for mental health scenarios

In the study, a virtual agent acted as an assistant to review the imaginary monthly schedule of the participant.

The stimulus materials were presented to 60 participants (30 elderly people and 30 younger adults) in 25 videos. All participants had to rate the agent's friendliness, intelligence, empathy, trustworthiness, and helpfulness immediately after watching each video. The results indicated that in the presence of the emotional nonverbal behaviors the elderly rated the agent as more empathic and trustworthy compared to the younger adults. The data also revealed that there were differences with respect to rating specific emotional nonverbal behaviors as more empathic than others. Elderly people perceived Dropping the Arms plus Sad Face, Head down, Sad Face, Head Nod plus Smile, and Smile as more empathic, and the nonverbal behaviors perceived as most empathic for the younger adults were Dropping the Arms plus Sad Face, and Head down.",,1,0,0,,1,conferencePaper,2018,"Hosseinpanah, Adineh; Krämer, Nicole C.; Straßmann, Carolin",Proceedings of the 6th International Conference on Human-Agent Interaction,978-1-4503-5953-5,,RIGNTCMX,10.1145/3284432.3284442,https://doi.org/10.1145/3284432.3284442,2018-12-04T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T21:25:58Z,2021-02-15T21:25:58Z,2021-02-15T00:00:00Z,184–190,,,,,,Empathy for Everyone?,HAI '18,,,,Association for Computing Machinery,"New York, NY, USA",,,,,,ACM Digital Library,,,,,,empathy; human-agent interaction; nonverbal-behavior,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ACM,empathy for everyone? the effect of age when evaluating a virtual agent,empathy for everyone the effect of age when evaluating a virtual agent

,,,,,,,,1,,Towards Empathic Conversational Interaction,"In recent years, ""computational empathy"" has emerged as a new challenging research field. Computational empathy investigates how artificial agents can manifest empathic behaviours towards the user, and how they can elicit empathy during the human-agent interaction. Such ""empathic agents"" have the capacity to place themselves into the emotional position of a user (or another agent), and behave taking such emotional understanding into account. The paper explores a computational empathy approach in the context of conversational interaction, and presents an empathic conversational framework grounded on the empathy theory. The framework provides a conceptual tool for designing and evaluating empathic conversational agents.

We propose a simulated empathy framework (SEF) in which artificial agents communicate directly with physical agents through verbal channels and social media.

Although best practice in user-centered design (such as iterative design, prototyping, user testing) also applies for this new type of product, the designer's skill set needs to be supplemented with design methods and practices that utilize bodily intelligence and empathy with the user. We present a framework for categorizing such body-centered design practices based on two dimensions: point-of-view (1st, 2nd, 3rd person) and tense (past, present, future). Inspired by Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology of the body, Shusterman's work on somaesthetics, and Buber's theories on intersubjectivity, the framework provides a language for talking about different ways designers and co-designers can utilize their body as a design resource.

,,,,,,,,1,,Emphatic human interaction analysis for cognitive environments,"Understanding the dynamic evolution of complex scenes where multiple patterns interact according to a hidden semantic goal is an issue of current intelligent environments. This issue is made somehow more complex due to the more spread and intensive use of camera systems to help human operators in the monitoring task. Analyzing multimedia data provided by wide set of cameras simultaneously monitoring different environments makes it necessary not only to focus the attention of human operators on relevant occurring events, but also to actively support their decision about optimal reactions to be taken to manage abnormal situations. Cognitive tasks to be modeled in integrated intelligent systems become not only multisensor data processing and scene understanding, but also proactive decision making: a recognized abnormal interactive situation occurring in the scene must be possibly controlled in such a way that divergence from normal event flow can not compromise security level of an environment. Cognitive environments often aim at friendly improving the usefulness of a given physical space by humans according to a given paradigm and objective of use. To this end, they often employ pervasive communications tools to send messages to cooperative humans in a given environment to help me in real time situations they are living, in order to help them to accomplish their tasks in a more smooth and effective way. To do so, they can use situation assessment tools interpreting available sensor data in terms of dynamic state and events generated by objects present in their scene and their interactions. In many cases, assessed situation can be not only estimated but also predicted, if dynamic models of it are available. Capability of predicting behavior of objects along a given interaction situation can be interpreted as a way to directly evaluate not only evolution of actions of a given object in a contextual framework determined by the interacting object, but also as a way to estimate and to predict (based on a indirect observation and an appropriate model) the subjective emotional and motivational hidden variables that carried the object to decide a certain action to be performed on the basis of subjectively sensed data. Therefore, if appropriate models are available a sort of empathic interaction analysis can be performed that should allow a cognitive environment to be ""immersively"" connected with interacting entities, being able to predict actions they will take in given contextual situation. Cognitive environments can take advantage of such an empathic interaction analysis in case they can be in communication with some of the humans involved in a given interaction, for example by using wireless terminals or varying message panels in a physical environment. In this case it comes out that it becomes interesting to study which architecture and processing methods can be used to design cognitive environments intelligence as a set of concurring continuous loops closing the gap between sensing and acting on real time evolving world. Based on the explanation of such premises, In this talk, attention will be paid to human interaction video analysis methods that are based on data representations suitable for allowing ""immersive"" estimation and prediction by an observing intelligent environment. Examples will be discussed of Bayesian approaches to representation and learning of interactions from video scene examples currently studied in our research group (www.isip40.it). Such approaches span from video tracking and behavior understanding issues, aiming at provide a robust basic vocabulary of video processing tools to detect and analyze human motion at finer resolution scales (i.e. multiple feature dynamic shape analysis), to development of methods to represent empathic models of interactions at coarser trajectory based scales. Coupled Dynamic Bayesian Networks are used in both cases as a problem representation guideline. In the latter case of coarser scale of analysis at the trajectory level, interaction structure is also learned by using bio-inspired principles. In both cases incremental adaptation is obtained as a result of the followed Bayesian approach. Architectural schemes and examples will be provided in the talk of the use of such techniques within cognitive systems where cooperative humans can be helped in performing a given interaction tasks by predictions obtained by empathic interaction models.",,0,0,0,1,0,conferencePaper,2010,"Regazzoni, Carlo S.",Proceedings of the first ACM international workshop on Analysis and retrieval of tracked events and motion in imagery streams,978-1-4503-0163-3,,L97BL5EQ,10.1145/1877868.1877870,https://doi.org/10.1145/1877868.1877870,2010-10-29T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T21:25:58Z,2021-02-15T21:25:58Z,2021-02-15T00:00:00Z,1–2,,,,,,,ARTEMIS '10,,,,Association for Computing Machinery,"New York, NY, USA",,,,,,ACM Digital Library,,,,,,ambient intelligence; cognitive surveillance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ACM,emphatic human interaction analysis for cognitive environments,emphatic human interaction analysis for cognitive environments

Either they do not encompass feedback tokens at all, or only support a limited set of stereotypical functions. However, this does not mirror the subtleties of spontaneous conversations. If we want to be able to build an artificial listener, as a first step towards building an empathetic artificial agent, we also need to be able to synthesize more subtle audio-visual feedback tokens. In this study, we devised an array of monomodal and multimodal binary comparison perception tests and experiments to understand how different realisations of verbal and visual feedback tokens influence third-party perception of the degree of attentiveness. This allowed us to investigate i) which features (amplitude, frequency, duration...) of the visual feedback influences attentiveness perception; ii) whether visual or verbal backchannels are perceived to be more attentive iii) whether the fusion of unimodal tokens with low perceived attentiveness increases the degree of perceived attentiveness compared to unimodal tokens with high perceived attentiveness taken alone; iv) the automatic ranking of audio-visual feedback token in terms of conveyed degree of attentiveness.",,1,1,0,,1,conferencePaper,2016,"Oertel, Catharine; Lopes, José; Yu, Yu; Mora, Kenneth A.

,,,,,,,,1,,Towards Reusable Personas for Everyday Design,"Personas are artificial character based representations of user goals, attitudes, motivations and abilities which enable designers to focus their design efforts on key, targeted users. The success of personas in design is due to their capacity to enable designers to empathize with users and understand user goals. Persona development is rooted in the rigorous collection and analysis of data specifically related to the design project being undertaken. New design projects thus require the development of new personas. Since redevelopment is not always achievable attention has turned towards reuse of personas and the underlying data.

Current cognitive agent architectures usually include situation awareness that allows agents to sense their environment, including their human partner, and provide congruent empathic behaviours. Depending on the framework, agents may exhibit their own personality, culture, memories, goals and reasoning styles. However, tailored adaptive behaviours based on multi-dimensional and deep understanding of the human essential for enduring beneficial relationships in certain contexts are lacking.

As an inevitable result of this shift, the technology penetrates into education in myriad forms. Intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) are essential outcomes of this penetration, emerging to satisfy the needs of learners and instructors. Their working principle is based on collecting and processing data of all students through various modalities to understand the strengths and needs of learners. Yet, more important is that ITSs untangle the overlooked problem of traditional education: One size does not fit all, and there is a need for personalized tutoring for each individual. It is well known that that learning is emotional as well as intellectual.

,,,,,,,,1,,Semi-supervised model personalization for improved detection of learner's emotional engagement,"Affective states play a crucial role in learning. Existing Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) fail to track affective states of learners accurately. Without an accurate detection of such states, ITSs are limited in providing truly personalized learning experience. In our longitudinal research, we have been working towards developing an empathic autonomous 'tutor' closely monitoring students in real-time using multiple sources of data to understand their affective states corresponding to emotional engagement. We focus on detecting learning related states (i.e., 'Satisfied', 'Bored', and 'Confused'). We have collected 210 hours of data through authentic classroom pilots of 17 sessions. We collected information from two modalities: (1) appearance, which is collected from the camera, and (2) context-performance, that is derived from the content platform. The learning content of the content platform consists of two section types: (1) instructional where students watch instructional videos and (2) assessment where students solve exercise questions. Since there are individual differences in expressing affective states, the detection of emotional engagement needs to be customized for each individual. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical semi-supervised model adaptation method to achieve highly accurate emotional engagement detectors. In the initial calibration phase, a personalized context-performance classifier is obtained. In the online usage phase, the appearance classifier is automatically personalized using the labels generated by the context-performance model. The experimental results show that personalization enables performance improvement of our generic emotional engagement detectors. The proposed semi-supervised hierarchical personalization method result in 89.23% and 75.20% F1 measures for the instructional and assessment sections respectively.",,1,0,0,,1,conferencePaper,2016,"Alyuz, Nese; Okur, Eda; Oktay, Ece; Genc, Utku; Aslan, Sinem; Mete, Sinem Emine; Arnrich, Bert; Esme, Asli Arslan",Proceedings of the 18th ACM International Conference on Multimodal Interaction,978-1-4503-4556-9,,H3ECBJKL,10.1145/2993148.2993166,https://doi.org/10.1145/2993148.2993166,2016-10-31T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T21:26:45Z,2021-02-15T21:26:45Z,2021-02-15T00:00:00Z,100–107,,,,,,,ICMI '16,,,,Association for Computing Machinery,"New York, NY, USA",,,,,,ACM Digital Library,,,,,,affective computing; personalization; adaptive learning; intelligent tutoring systems; Emotional engagement detection,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ACM,semi-supervised model personalization for improved detection of learner's emotional engagement,semisupervised model personalization for improved detection of learners emotional engagement
,,,,,,,,1,,Reputation Agent: Prompting Fair Reviews in Gig Markets,"Our study presents a new tool, Reputation Agent, to promote fairer reviews from requesters (employers or customers) on gig markets. Unfair reviews, created when requesters consider factors outside of a worker's control, are known to plague gig workers and can result in lost job opportunities and even termination from the marketplace. Our tool leverages machine learning to implement an intelligent interface that: (1) uses deep learning to automatically detect when an individual has included unfair factors into her review (factors outside the worker's control per the policies of the market); and (2) prompts the individual to reconsider her review if she has incorporated unfair factors. To study the effectiveness of Reputation Agent, we conducted a controlled experiment over different gig markets. Our experiment illustrates that across markets, Reputation Agent, in contrast with traditional approaches, motivates requesters to review gig workers' performance more fairly. We discuss how tools that bring more transparency to employers about the policies of a gig market can help build empathy thus resulting in reasoned discussions around potential injustices towards workers generated by these interfaces. Our vision is that with tools that promote truth and transparency we can bring fairer treatment to gig workers. © 2020 ACM.",,0,0,0,,0,conferencePaper,2020,"Toxtli, C.; Richmond-Fuller, A.; Savage, S.","The Web Conference 2020 - Proceedings of the World Wide Web Conference, WWW 2020",,,5IUXKTQ3,10.1145/3366423.3380199,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85086589321&doi=10.1145%2f3366423.3380199&partnerID=40&md5=8235c305e0974c8f0c5d3911f16d1058,2020-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:36:21Z,2021-02-15T22:36:21Z,,1228-1240,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 0</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,reputation agent: prompting fair reviews in gig markets,reputation agent prompting fair reviews in gig markets
,,,,,,,,1,,The OMG-Empathy Dataset: Evaluating the Impact of Affective Behavior in Storytelling,"Processing human affective behavior is important for developing intelligent agents that interact with humans in complex interaction scenarios. A large number of current approaches that address this problem focus on classifying emotion expressions by grouping them into known categories. Such strategies neglect, among other aspects, the impact of the affective responses from an individual on their interaction partner thus ignoring how people empathize towards each other. This is also reflected in the datasets used to train models for affective processing tasks. Most of the recent datasets, in particular, the ones which capture natural interactions (”in-the-wild” datasets), are designed, collected, and annotated based on the recognition of displayed affective reactions, ignoring how these displayed or expressed emotions are perceived. In this paper, we propose a novel dataset composed of dyadic interactions designed, collected and annotated with a focus on measuring the affective impact that eight different stories have on the listener. Each video of the dataset contains around 5 minutes of interaction where a speaker tells a story to a listener. After each interaction, the listener annotated, using a valence scale, how the story impacted their affective state, reflecting how they empathized with the speaker as well as the story. We also propose different evaluation protocols and a baseline that encourages participation in the advancement of the field of artificial empathy and emotion contagion.",,1,0,0,0,1,conferencePaper,2019,"Barros, Pablo; Churamani, Nikhil; Lim, Angelica; Wermter, Stefan",2019 8TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON AFFECTIVE COMPUTING AND IN℡LIGENT INTERACTION (ACII),978-1-72813-888-6,,VTQCD4E9,,,2019-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-11T03:48:21Z,2021-02-11T03:48:21Z,,,,,,,,,International Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction,,,,IEEE,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",English,,,,,,,ISSN: 2156-8103 Type: Proceedings Paper,"<p>8th International Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction (ACII), Cambridge, ENGLAND, SEP 03-06, 2019</p>",,,Empathy; Affective Behaviour; Dyadic Interactions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web of Science,the omg-empathy dataset: evaluating the impact of affective behavior in storytelling,the omgempathy dataset evaluating the impact of affective behavior in storytelling

,,,,,,,,1,,Intersectional AI: A Study of How Information Science Students Think about Ethics and Their Impact,"Recent literature has demonstrated the limited and, in some instances, waning role of ethical training in computing classes in the US. The capacity for artificial intelligence (AI) to be inequitable or harmful is well documented, yet it's an issue that continues to lack apparent urgency or effective mitigation. The question we raise in this paper is how to prepare future generations to recognize and grapple with the ethical concerns of a range of issues plaguing AI, particularly when they are combined with surveillance technologies in ways that have grave implications for social participation and restriction?from risk assessment and bail assignment in criminal justice, to public benefits distribution and access to housing and other critical resources that enable security and success within society. The US is a mecca of information and computer science (IS and CS) learning for Asian students whose experiences as minorities renders them familiar with, and vulnerable to, the societal bias that feeds AI bias. Our goal was to better understand how students who are being educated to design AI systems think about these issues, and in particular, their sensitivity to intersectional considerations that heighten risk for vulnerable groups. In this paper we report on findings from qualitative interviews with 20 graduate students, 11 from an AI class and 9 from a Data Mining class. We find that students are not predisposed to think deeply about the implications of AI design for the privacy and well-being of others unless explicitly encouraged to do so. When they do, their thinking is focused through the lens of personal identity and experience, but their reflections tend to center on bias, an intrinsic feature of design, rather than on fairness, an outcome that requires them to imagine the consequences of AI. While they are, in fact, equipped to think about fairness when prompted by discussion and by design exercises that explicitly invite consideration of intersectionality and structural inequalities, many need help to do this empathy 'work.' Notably, the students who more frequently reflect on intersectional problems related to bias and fairness are also more likely to consider the connection between model attributes and bias, and the interaction with context. Our findings suggest that experience with identity-based vulnerability promotes more analytically complex thinking about AI, lending further support to the argument that identity-related ethics should be integrated into IS and CS curriculums, rather than positioned as a stand-alone course.",,0,0,1,,0,journalArticle,2020,"McDonald, Nora; Pan, Shimei",Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction,,,XGRSSFNU,10.1145/3415218,https://doi.org/10.1145/3415218,2020-10-14T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T21:25:58Z,2021-02-15T21:25:58Z,2021-02-15T21:25:13Z,147:1–147:19,,CSCW2,4,,Proc.

,,,,,,,,1,,The need for an emotional intelligence for information technology course: framework for educators and academic institutions,"Information Technology (IT) professionals are tasked with problem solving and educating the user on the solution at hand as well as assisting the organization with the correct use of technology to optimize business practices. The manner in which an IT professional communicates their knowledge and instructions for problem solving can be stifled through insufficient interpersonal skills. Currently, IT professionals use main sources of communication, such as email or a management system software tool, in which sufficient time can be taken to craft messages. However, when adequate time is not available to think about a response or read between the lines of a client's problem, the IT professional may find it challenging to communicate with empathy of the client's perspective, which can detract from the collaboration or problem-solving goal of the conversation. As such, organizations report that there is a vital need for IT students to understand and rely upon positive emotion intelligence (EI) to intergrade the interpersonal skills that allow the professional to be both a problem-solver and effective communicator. However, there is limited or nonexistent literature on the EI for IT courses, skills, and assessments. This research investigated current and past the employment needs by examining online IT job advertisements within the United States. Results revealed several key EI skills sought by IT employers. Based upon these results, a solid framework in support of an EI for IT course is offered.

,,,,,,,,1,,Leveraging emotional intelligence (soft skills) to maximize career success for computer science students,"With an industry focus on agile development practices, a premium has been put on communication and teamwork skills [21]. Software developers in the tech space will often need to interact with other developers, UX professionals, software testers, and perhaps even culturally diverse customers and clients. The capacity of professionals in this space need to meet customer expectations in a very competitive market centers around the ability of individuals to not only work collectively and as seamlessly as possible, but to also create synergies with a diverse group of professional colleagues. Individuals that have experience working in teams to accomplish goals tend to be more productive in meeting deliverables on agile software development projects [22]. Moreover, companies such as Google, Zappos, and Amazon, are using assessments of soft skills (or emotional intelligence) during the job search process to vet candidates [14]. Furthermore, Dr. Joseph Homan, former Chief Operating Officer at ZekiahTech in Maryland, tests for soft skills extensively when interviewing a new technical candidate and stated that he has noted that candidates with fewer soft skills are often perceived as having lower technical skills (personal communication, November 14, 2014). Another area where EI skills such as awareness of others and empathy is essential is in user experience. Being able to understand the user that technology is being designed for is vital to the ultimate success of the product.

,,,,,,,,1,,Artificial intelligence and the future of psychiatry: Qualitative findings from a global physician survey,"Background: The potential for machine learning to disrupt the medical profession is the subject of ongoing debate within biomedical informatics. Objective: This study aimed to explore psychiatrists’ opinions about the potential impact innovations in artificial intelligence and machine learning on psychiatric practice Methods: In Spring 2019, we conducted a web-based survey of 791 psychiatrists from 22 countries worldwide. The survey measured opinions about the likelihood future technology would fully replace physicians in performing ten key psychiatric tasks. This study involved qualitative descriptive analysis of written responses (“comments”) to three open-ended questions in the survey. Results: Comments were classified into four major categories in relation to the impact of future technology on: (1) patient-psychiatrist interactions; (2) the quality of patient medical care; (3) the profession of psychiatry; and (4) health systems. Overwhelmingly, psychiatrists were skeptical that technology could replace human empathy. Many predicted that ‘man and machine’ would increasingly collaborate in undertaking clinical decisions, with mixed opinions about the benefits and harms of such an arrangement. Participants were optimistic that technology might improve efficiencies and access to care, and reduce costs. Ethical and regulatory considerations received limited attention. Conclusions: This study presents timely information on psychiatrists’ views about the scope of artificial intelligence and machine learning on psychiatric practice. Psychiatrists expressed divergent views about the value and impact of future technology with worrying omissions about practice guidelines, and ethical and regulatory issues. © The Author(s) 2020.",,1,0,0,0,1,journalArticle,2020,"Blease, C.; Locher, C.; Leon-Carlyle, M.; Doraiswamy, M.",Digital Health,,,BINWUHBM,10.1177/2055207620968355,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85094669527&doi=10.1177%2f2055207620968355&partnerID=40&md5=5e2909e410f68527e010deb3b1f9b7b3,2020-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:33:59Z,2021-02-15T22:33:59Z,,,,,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 0</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,artificial intelligence and the future of psychiatry: qualitative findings from a global physician survey,artificial intelligence and the future of psychiatry qualitative findings from a global physician survey
,,,,,,,,1,,A LX (Learner EXperience)-Based Evaluation Method of the Education and Training Programs for Professional Software Engineers,"We propose a new design methodology to maximize the training effect in a corporate education and training for professional software engineers. Conventionally, the education and training programs have been designed in a top-down manner based on the long-term strategy on the business and engineering resources development. However, to draw out the learners' high performance from the education and training programs, we need to have an empathy with the learners, and to analyze their expectations and emotions in order to motivate them. Therefore, this paper proposes the learner-centered design methodology of the corporate education and training programs inspired by the design thinking and lean start-up concepts. We define the learning processes in the education and training programs as LX (Learner eXperience), and propose LJM (Learning Journey Map) as the LX evaluation method as an extension of CJM (Customer Journey Map) in UX (User eXperience) design. The LJM enables to evaluate training effect and communicate with stakeholders in the training design expressing the LX quantitatively in a visual form. We applied the proposed design methodology to the education and training programs for professional software engineers in a company to evaluate LX and elicit learner requirements to the programs. We applied the proposed LJM to the education and training program of two levels of the whole program and its LUs (Learning Units), and identified problems in the LX. From the empirical study, we confirm the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.",0,1,0,0,0,1,conferencePaper,2019,"Kawano, Atsuko; Motoyama, Yuji; Aoyama, Mikio",Proceedings of the 2019 7th International Conference on Information and Education Technology,978-1-4503-6639-7,,8P9JPI7W,10.1145/3323771.3323789,https://doi.org/10.1145/3323771.3323789,2019-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T21:31:58Z,2021-02-15T21:31:58Z,,151–159,,,,,,,ICIET 2019,,,,Association for Computing Machinery,"New York, NY, USA",,,,,,,,"event-place: Aizu-Wakamatsu, Japan",,,Design thinking; Corporate education and training program; Journey map; Lean start-up; LX (Learner eXperience); Professional software engineer; UX (User eXperience),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ACM,a lx (learner experience)-based evaluation method of the education and training programs for professional software engineers,a lx learner experiencebased evaluation method of the education and training programs for professional software engineers

,,,,,,,,1,,Reflecting on Attitudes Towards Death Through the Use of Immersive Virtual Reality Commercial Video Games,"Video games can be an invaluable learning tool beyond pure skill acquisition, such as teaching us how to empathize with others or even self-reflecting on basic existential concerns: isolation, freedom, meaninglessness or death. This is further emphasized with the use of immersive technologies and becomes especially relevant when the experience itself is very difficult to replicate, when not impossible, in the real world. On that regard, this paper analyzes the impact of virtual reality (VR) commercial video games on the existential concern of one's own death. Participants (N 30) played one of three games for 15 minutes and the aftermath was examined using questionnaires and the implicit relational assessment procedure (IRAP). Our results show that there is no difference in the game experience, despite the different gameplay. However, IRAP results seem to indicate that players of the action game have a different attitude towards death.",0,1,0,0,0,1,conferencePaper,2020,"Bourdin, Pierre; Calvet, Laura; Tesconi, Susanna; Arnedo-Moreno, Joan",Eighth International Conference on Technological Ecosystems for Enhancing Multiculturality,978-1-4503-8850-4,,U4FVUYYG,10.1145/3434780.3436559,https://doi.org/10.1145/3434780.3436559,2020-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T21:33:25Z,2021-02-15T21:33:25Z,,640–647,,,,,,,TEEM'20,,,,Association for Computing Machinery,"New York, NY, USA",,,,,,,,"event-place: Salamanca, Spain",,,Virtual reality; serious games; death-evaluation; death-identity; existential games; immersive player experiences; Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure; video games,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ACM,reflecting on attitudes towards death through the use of immersive virtual reality commercial video games,reflecting on attitudes towards death through the use of immersive virtual reality commercial video games

First, the limitation of the current progress of AI focusing on deep learning is pointed out from a viewpoint of the emergence of consciousness. Next, the outline of ideological back-ground on issues of mind in a broad sense is shown. Then, cognitive developmental robotics (CDR) is introduced with two important concepts; physical embodiment and social interaction both of which help to shape conscious minds. Following the working hypothesis, existing studies of CDR are briefly introduced and missing issues are indicated. Finally, an issue how robots (artificial systems) could be moral and legal agents is shown. © 2018 for the individual papers by the papers' authors.

This work presents some of the activities carried out by the apprentices through the Educational Robotics in Tecnoacademia Risaralda and Tecnoacademia Caldas sites, based on Industrial and Mechatronic Design methodologies, using LEGO MINDSTORM EV3 kits and Design Thinking for educators and LEGO, successfully applied in the EducarChile program. It is based on three fundamental pillars, which are empathy, collaboration and experimentation, which are presented in the five (5) phases of the methodology. It should be noted that the tools of innovation and prototyping per se, do not serve much if the team that executes them is not immersed in a culture of tolerance, teamwork, leadership and if there is no feedback and if the capacities are not taken into account and strengths of the work team. All this was achieved through different prototypes of robots of light and robust type originated in a PON scenario (problem, opportunity, needs). © 2018 CEUR-WS.

To overcome the problem, we create a new conversational system to automatically generate responses for users requests on social media. Our system is integrated with state-of-the-art deep learning techniques and is trained by nearly 1M Twitter conversations between users and agents from over 60 brands. The evaluation reveals that over 40% of the requests are emotional, and the system is about as good as human agents in showing empathy to help users cope with emotional situations.

The interaction via natural language in combination with a human-like design promises service that is always available, fast, and with a consistent quality and at the same time resembles a human service encounter. However, current conversational agents exhibit the same inherent limitation that every interactive technology has, which is a lack of social skills. In this study, we make a first step towards overcoming this limitation by presenting a design approach that combines automatic sentiment analysis with adaptive responses to emulate empathy in a service encounter. By means of an experiment with 112 participants, we evaluate the approach and find empirical support that a CA with sentiment-adaptive responses is perceived as more empathetic, human-like, and socially present and, in particular, yields a higher service encounter satisfaction. © 40th International Conference on Information Systems, ICIS 2019.

In motivational interviewing, it is desirable for the counselor to communicate empathy towards the client to promote better therapy outcomes. In this paper, we propose a deep neural network (DNN) system for predicting counselors' session level empathy ratings from transcripts of the interactions. First, we train a recurrent neural network mapping the text of each speaker turn to a set of task-specific behavioral acts that represent local dynamics of the client-counselor interaction. Subsequently, this network is used to initialize lower layers of a deep network predicting session level counselor empathy rating. We show that this method outperforms training the DNN end-to-end in a single stage and also outperforms a baseline neural network model that attempts to predict empathy ratings directly from text without modeling turn level behavioral dynamics.

This area of research has received recent attention from the computer science, human-computer interaction and psychological research communities. The research team consisted of three students; a computer science, sociology and marketing major. The team worked to understand the complexities of detecting emotions based on facial movement. The team collected time stamped facial emotional data from 210 participants as they watched a video clip from the popular movie depicting bullying behavior towards a disabled person. The results demonstrated significant before-and- after mean differences in emotions that are characterized as empathic towards the main character for the bullying events, which is a promising start to detecting empathic reactions.

Méthode Dans la perspective d’une ouverture théorique à la fois phénoménologique et psychanalytique, l’auto-empathie est le processus au cours duquel, en prenant la position de l’« autrui-en-soi », nous nous représentons notre monde subjectif – soit l’ensemble de nos états de subjectivité (actions, émotions, pensées) –, par relation empathique avec nous-mêmes. Cette relation d’auto-empathie correspond à une opération de distanciation, et d’appropriation symbolique, au cours de laquelle nous nous dédoublons, en mettant en œuvre notre faculté innée d’être à la fois sujet et objet pour nous-mêmes. Résultats La médiatisation de l’auto-empathie dans les mondes numériques permet de nous mettre à la place d’une figure qui nous représente – notre avatar –, de sorte que notre empathie est tournée vers nous-mêmes indirectement. Ce second temps d’empathie pour une figure virtuelle de soi, nommé « auto-empathie médiatisée » ou « auto-empathie virtuelle », favoriserait dans un troisième temps le développement d’une empathie pour soi. Enfin, le développement d’une empathie pour autrui serait soutenu dans un quatrième temps, par l’attention que les joueurs se portent les uns aux autres dans les jeux en réseau. Discussion Ces quatre hypothèses, illustrées par des cas cliniques, ouvrent une interrogation portant sur le cadre en psychanalyse. À l’adolescence, le travail de virtualisation, qui consiste en l’anticipation créatrice de ses possibilités subjectives, apparaît régulièrement contrarié. La duplicité psychique n’est plus à même d’opérer une distance symbolisante entre le soi réel et le soi virtuel, entre le soi subjectif et le soi subjectivant. L’autrui-en-soi est inefficace à proposer à l’adolescence un dialogue empathique avec soi-même. En conséquence, l’autoreprésentation flirte avec l’effondrement, en particulier dans les états de cassures subjectives. Or, les espaces numériques pourraient bien être pour l’adolescent des supports indirects d’appropriation d’expériences subjectives. Conclusion Nos réflexions ont conduit à penser l’auto-empathie comme la réalisation de l’autrui-en-soi qui permet de nous représenter notre propre monde subjectif. L’auto-empathie médiatisée par un avatar peut donc être décrite comme une représentation par empathie de notre part subjective contenue par ce personnage. Dès lors, l’espace du jeu vidéo se présente comme un espace de subjectivation. Objectives The authors propose to explore a psychic phenomenon, the “auto-empathy”, as implemented in the context of digital spaces and particularly in the situation of the player who embodies an avatar (a pixel figure) in a video game. Method From the perspective of a theoretical opening both phenomenological and psychoanalytic, auto-empathy is the process in which, taking the position of the “other-in-oneself”, we represent our subjective world – or the all states of our subjectivity (actions, emotions, thoughts) – by an empathic relationship with ourselves. The auto-empathy relationship is a process of distancing, and symbolic appropriation, in which we are divided into halves, implementing our innate ability to be both subject and object for ourselves. Results The mediatization of auto-empathy in digital worlds can put ourselves instead of a figure that represents us – our avatar – so that our empathy is turned towards ourselves indirectly. This second time of empathy for a virtual figure of the self, called “mediatized auto-empathy” or “virtual auto-empathy”, would contribute thirdly to the development of empathy for oneself. Finally, the development of empathy for others would be supported in a fourth time, by the attention the players are paying to each other in network games. Discussion These four hypotheses, illustrated by clinical cases, open an interrogation concerning the frame of the psychoanalytical work. In the adolescent, the work of virtualisation, which consists in the creative anticipation of its subjective possibilities, seems regularly impeded. The mental duplicity is no longer in a position to operate a symbolizing distance between the real self and the virtual self, between the subjective self and the subjectivising self. The other-in-oneself is ineffective in proposing to the adolescent an empathic dialogue with oneself. Consequently, the autorepresentation flirts with the seizure, in particular in the subjective states of breaks. Nevertheless, the digital spaces could be indirect media of appropriation of subjective experiences for the teenager. Conclusion Our reflections led us to think of auto-empathy as the realization of the other-in-oneself which allows us to represent our own subjective world. The auto-empathy mediatized by an avatar can thus be described as a representation by empathy of our subjective part that contains this character. From then on, the space of the video game appears as a space of subjectivation.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2016,"Tordo, Frédéric; Binkley, Caroline",L'Évolution Psychiatrique,,0014-3855,N3XDLEVX,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.evopsy.2014.02.002,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001438551400036X,2016-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T21:50:15Z,2021-02-15T21:50:15Z,,293-308,,2,81,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Empathy; Phenomenology; Auto-empathy; MMORPG; Video games; Others-in-oneself; Psychoanalysis; Reflexiveness; Subjectivation; Theoretical study; Auto-empathie; Autrui-en-soi; Empathie; Étude théorique; Jeu vidéo; Phénoménologie; Psychanalyse; Réflexivité,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Science Direct,"l’auto-empathie, ou le devenir de l’autrui-en-soi : définition et clinique du virtuel",lautoempathie ou le devenir de lautruiensoi définition et clinique du virtuel
,,,,,,,,1,,"Emotion Recognition for Self-aid in Addiction Treatment, Psychotherapy, and Nonviolent Communication","This position paper aims to highlight possible future directions of applications for Affective Computing (AC) and Emotion Recognition (ER) for self-aid applications, as they emerge from the experience of the ACER-EMORE Workshops Series. ER in Artificial Intelligence offers a growing number of problem-solving multidisciplinary opportunities. Most current AC and ER applications are focused on a somewhat controversial enterprise-centered approach, i.e., recognizing user emotions to enable a third-party to achieve its own goals, in areas such as e-commerce, cybersecurity, behavior profiling, user experience. In this work we propose to explore a human-centered research direction, aiming at using AC/ER to enhance user consciousness of emotional states, ultimately supporting the development of self-aid applications. The use of facial ER and text ER to help forms of assistive technologies in the fields of Psychotherapy and Communication is an example of such a human-centered approach. A general framework for ER in Self-aid is depicted, and some relevant application domains are suggested and discussed: dependencies treatment (DT) (e.g., workaholism, sexaholism); non-violent communication (NVC) for people in leading roles using e-mail or chat communication; empathy learning for parents and teachers in the circle-of-security (COS) caring environment. Far from being complete and comprehensive, the purpose of this work is to trigger discussions and ideas for feasible studies and applications of ER in self-aid, which we hope to see published in the future editions of our workshops, believing that it may be one of the drops needed in the ocean of a better world. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",0,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2019,"Franzoni, V.; Milani, A.",Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),,,HY49NUYS,10.1007/978-3-030-24296-1_32,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85069166203&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-24296-1_32&partnerID=40&md5=9fd3cca43de6e1c5747776bab3c03cf0,2019-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:34:00Z,2021-02-15T22:34:00Z,,391-404,,,11620 LNCS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 4</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,"emotion recognition for self-aid in addiction treatment, psychotherapy, and nonviolent communication",emotion recognition for selfaid in addiction treatment psychotherapy and nonviolent communication

Major depression is associated with impaired psychosocial functioning and reduced quality of life. Challenges such as shortage of mental health personnel, long waiting times, perceived stigma, and lower government spends pose barriers to the alleviation of mental health problems. Face-to-face psychotherapy alone provides only point-in-time support and cannot scale quickly enough to address this growing global public health challenge. Artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled, empathetic, and evidence-driven conversational mobile app technologies could play an active role in filling this gap by increasing adoption and enabling reach. Although such a technology can help manage these barriers, they should never replace time with a health care professional for more severe mental health problems. However, app technologies could act as a supplementary or intermediate support system. Mobile mental well-being apps need to uphold privacy and foster both short-and long-term positive outcomes. Objective: This study aimed to present a preliminary real-world data evaluation of the effectiveness and engagement levels of an AI-enabled, empathetic, text-based conversational mobile mental well-being app, Wysa, on users with self-reported symptoms of depression. Methods: In the study, a group of anonymous global users were observed who voluntarily installed the Wysa app, engaged in text-based messaging, and self-reported symptoms of depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. On the basis of the extent of app usage on and between 2 consecutive screening time points, 2 distinct groups of users (high users and low users) emerged. The study used mixed-methods approach to evaluate the impact and engagement levels among these users. The quantitative analysis measured the app impact by comparing the average improvement in symptoms of depression between high and low users. The qualitative analysis measured the app engagement and experience by analyzing in-app user feedback and evaluated the performance of a machine learning classifier to detect user objections during conversations. Results: The average mood improvement (ie, difference in pre-and post-self-reported depression scores) between the groups (ie, high vs low users; n=108 and n=21, respectively) revealed that the high users group had significantly higher average improvement (mean 5.84 [SD 6.66]) compared with the low users group (mean 3.52 [SD 6.15]); Mann-Whitney P=.03 and with a moderate effect size of 0.63. Moreover, 67.7% of user-provided feedback responses found the app experience helpful and encouraging. Conclusions: The real-world data evaluation findings on the effectiveness and engagement levels of Wysa app on users with self-reported symptoms of depression show promise. However, further work is required to validate these initial findings in much larger samples and across longer periods. © Becky Inkster, Shubhankar Sarda, Vinod Subramanian.",1,1,0,0,0,1,journalArticle,2018,"Inkster, B.; Sarda, S.; Subramanian, V.",JMIR mHealth and uHealth,,,HSMDWS93,10.2196/12106,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85060334446&doi=10.2196%2f12106&partnerID=40&md5=ee4042f0f43089954f87f8eb3205565f,2018-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:34:01Z,2021-02-15T22:34:01Z,,,,11,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 58</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,"an empathy-driven, conversational artificial intelligence agent (wysa) for digital mental well-being: real-world data evaluation mixed-methods study",an empathydriven conversational artificial intelligence agent wysa for digital mental wellbeing realworld data evaluation mixedmethods study

Active listening surpasses passive listening or simple hearing to establish a deeper connection between speaker and listener, as the listener gives the speaker full attention via inquiry, reflection, respect, and empathy. This article offers a method and tools for teaching active listening that can be implemented in online, hybrid, or face-to-face platforms. We begin by reviewing the great demand for listening skills, in light of how little time is spent on listening instruction compared with that on speaking instruction. We then present a set of learning materials and a procedure for using them that includes both pre- and posttests, multimedia learning materials, and exercises that enhance skill development. We follow the learning plan with analyses of both quantitative and qualitative data, showing support for the suggested method. These results fit with our personal experience of consistent success with the method across student levels (graduate and undergraduate) and platforms (online and face-to-face).

,,,,,,,,1,,Mock ECHO: A Simulation-Based Medical Education Method,"Problem: This study was designed to develop a deeper understanding of the learning and social processes that take place during the simulation-based medical education for practicing providers as part of the Project ECHO (R) model, known as Mock ECHO training. The ECHO model is utilized to expand access to care of common and complex diseases by supporting the education of primary care providers with an interprofessional team of specialists via videoconferencing networks. Intervention: Mock ECHO trainings are conducted through a train the trainer model targeted at leaders replicating the ECHO model at their organizations. Trainers conduct simulated teleECHO clinics while participants gain skills to improve communication and self-efficacy. Context: Three focus groups, conducted between May 2015 and January 2016 with a total of 26 participants, were deductively analyzed to identify common themes related to simulation-based medical education and interdisciplinary education. Principal themes generated from the analysis included (a) the role of empathy in community development, (b) the value of training tools as guides for learning, (c) Mock ECHO design components to optimize learning, (d) the role of interdisciplinary education to build community and improve care delivery, (e) improving care integration through collaboration, and (f) development of soft skills to facilitate learning. Outcome: Mock ECHO trainings offer clinicians the freedom to learn in a noncritical environment while emphasizing real-time multidirectional feedback and encouraging knowledge and skill transfer. Lessons Learned: The success of the ECHO model depends on training interprofessional healthcare providers in behaviors needed to lead a teleECHO clinic and to collaborate in the educational process.

,,,,,,,,1,,Robots As Intentional Agents: Using Neuroscientific Methods to Make Robots Appear More Social.,"Robots are increasingly envisaged as our future cohabitants. However, while considerable progress has been made in recent years in terms of their technological realization, the ability of robots to interact with humans in an intuitive and social way is still quite limited. An important challenge for social robotics is to determine how to design robots that can perceive the user's needs, feelings, and intentions, and adapt to users over a broad range of cognitive abilities. It is conceivable that if robots were able to adequately demonstrate these skills, humans would eventually accept them as social companions. We argue that the best way to achieve this is using a systematic experimental approach based on behavioral and physiological neuroscience methods such as motion/eye-tracking, electroencephalography, or functional near-infrared spectroscopy embedded in interactive human-robot paradigms. This approach requires understanding how humans interact with each other, how they perform tasks together and how they develop feelings of social connection over time, and using these insights to formulate design principles that make social robots attuned to the workings of the human brain. In this review, we put forward the argument that the likelihood of artificial agents being perceived as social companions can be increased by designing them in a way that they are perceived as intentional agents that activate areas in the human brain involved in social-cognitive processing. We first review literature related to social-cognitive processes and mechanisms involved in human-human interactions, and highlight the importance of perceiving others as intentional agents to activate these social brain areas. We then discuss how attribution of intentionality can positively affect human-robot interaction by (a) fostering feelings of social connection, empathy and prosociality, and by (b) enhancing performance on joint human-robot tasks. Lastly, we describe circumstances under which attribution of intentionality to robot agents might be disadvantageous, and discuss challenges associated with designing social robots that are inspired by neuroscientific principles.",1,0,0,1,0,0,journalArticle,2017,Wiese E; Metta G; Wykowska A,Frontiers in psychology,,1664-1078,28WCDBU4,,,2017-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:18:05Z,2021-02-15T22:18:05Z,,,,,8,,,Robots As Intentional Agents,,,,,,,English,,,,,Open WorldCat,,OCLC: 7162799280,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WorldCat,robots as intentional agents: using neuroscientific methods to make robots appear more social.,robots as intentional agents using neuroscientific methods to make robots appear more social
,,,,,,,,1,,A Survey of Behavioral Models for Social Robots,"The cooperation between humans and robots is becoming increasingly important in our society. Consequently, there is a growing interest in the development of models that can enhance and enrich the interaction between humans and robots. A key challenge in the Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) field is to provide robots with cognitive and affective capabilities, by developing architectures that let them establish empathetic relationships with users. Over the last several years, multiple models were proposed to face this open-challenge. This work provides a survey of the most relevant attempts/works. In details, it offers an overview of the architectures present in literature focusing on three specific aspects of HRI: the development of adaptive behavioral models, the design of cognitive architectures, and the ability to establish empathy with the user. The research was conducted within two databases: Scopus and Web of Science. Accurate exclusion criteria were applied to screen the 4916 articles found. At the end, 56 articles were selected. For each work, an evaluation of the model is made. Pros and cons of each work are detailed by analyzing the aspects that can be improved to establish an enjoyable interaction between robots and users.",1,0,0,1,0,0,journalArticle,2019,,Robotics,,2218-6581,MS8TB94B,,,2019-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:18:21Z,2021-02-15T22:18:21Z,,,,3,8,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Open WorldCat,,OCLC: 8186616241,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WorldCat,a survey of behavioral models for social robots,a survey of behavioral models for social robots
,,,,,,,,1,,Engineering Kindness: Building a Machine with Compassionate Intelligence,"The author provides first steps toward building a software agent/robot with compassionate intelligence. She approaches this goal with an example software agent, EM-2. She also gives a generalized software requirements guide for anyone wishing to pursue other means of building compassionate intelligence into an AI system. The purpose of EM-2 is not to build an agent with a state of mind that mimics empathy or consciousness, but rather to create practical applications of AI systems with knowledge and reasoning methods that positively take into account the feelings and state of self and others during decision making, action, or problem solving. To program EM-2 the author re-purposes code and architectural ideas from collaborative multi-agent systems and affective common sense reasoning with new concepts and philosophies from the human arts and sciences relating to compassion. EM-2 has predicates and an agent architecture based on a meta-cognition mental process that was used on India's worst prisoners to cultivate compassion for others, Vipassana or mindfulness. She describes and presents code snippets for common sense based affective inference and the I-TMS, an Irrational Truth Maintenance System, that maintains consistency in agent memory as feelings change over time, and provides a machine theoretic description of the consistency issues of combining affect and logic.

,,,,,,,,1,,Classification of social anhedonia using temporal and spatial network features from a social cognition fMRI task.,"Previous studies have suggested that the degree of social anhedonia reflects the vulnerability for developing schizophrenia. However, only few studies have investigated how functional network changes are related to social anhedonia. The aim of this fMRI study was to classify subjects according to their degree of social anhedonia using supervised machine learning. More specifically, we extracted both spatial and temporal network features during a social cognition task from 70 subjects, and used support vector machines for classification. Since impairment in social cognition is well established in schizophrenia-spectrum disorders, the subjects performed a comic strip task designed to specifically probe theory of mind (ToM) and empathy processing. Features representing both temporal (time series) and network dynamics were extracted using task activation maps, seed region analysis, independent component analysis (ICA), and a newly developed multi-subject archetypal analysis (MSAA), which here aimed to further bridge aspects of both seed region analysis and decomposition by incorporating a spotlight approach.We found significant classification of subjects with elevated levels of social anhedonia when using the times series extracted using MSAA, indicating that temporal dynamics carry important information for classification of social anhedonia. Interestingly, we found that the same time series yielded the highest classification performance in a task classification of the ToM condition. Finally, the spatial network corresponding to that time series included both prefrontal and temporal-parietal regions as well as insula activity, which previously have been related schizotypy and the development of schizophrenia.",0,1,0,0,0,1,journalArticle,2019,Krohne LG; Wang Y; Hinrich JL; Moerup M; Chan RCK; Madsen KH,Human brain mapping,,1065-9471,UFLH3T4D,,,2019-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:21:32Z,2021-02-15T22:21:32Z,,4965-4981,,17,40,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Open WorldCat,,OCLC: 8199458307,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WorldCat,classification of social anhedonia using temporal and spatial network features from a social cognition fmri task.,classification of social anhedonia using temporal and spatial network features from a social cognition fmri task
,,,,,,,,1,,Oxytocin effects on the resting-state mentalizing brain network.,"Oxytocin (OT) has modulatory effects in both human behavior and in the brain, which is not limited in the specific brain area but also with the potential effect on connectivity with other brain regions. Evidence indicates that OT effects on human behavior are multifaceted, such as trust behavior, decrease anxiety, empathy and bonding behavior. For the vital role of mentalizing in understanding others, here we examine whether OT has a general effect on mentalizing brain network which is associated to the effect of related social behavioral and personality traits. Using a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled group design, we investigate the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging after intranasal OT or placebo. The functional connectivity (FC) maps with seed in left/right temporoparietal junction (lTPJ/rTPJ) showed that OT significantly increased connectivity between rTPJ and default attention network (DAN), but decreased the FC between lTPJ and medial prefrontal network (MPN). With machine learning approach, we report that identified altered FCs of TPJ can classify OT and placebo (PL) group. Moreover, individual's empathy trait can modulate the FC between left TPJ and right rectus (RECT), which shows a positive correlation with empathic concern in PL group but a negative correlation in OT group. These results demonstrate that OT has significant effect on FC with lTPJ and rTPJ, brain regions where are critical for mentalizing, and the empathy concern can modulate the FC. These findings advance our understanding of the neural mechanisms by which OT modulates social behaviors, especially in social interaction involving mentalizing.",0,1,0,0,0,1,journalArticle,2020,Wu H; Feng C; Lu X; Liu X; Liu Q,Brain imaging and behavior,,1931-7557,7235XRIC,,,2020-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:21:32Z,2021-02-15T22:21:32Z,,2530-2541,,6,14,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Open WorldCat,,OCLC: 8513802777,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WorldCat,oxytocin effects on the resting-state mentalizing brain network.,oxytocin effects on the restingstate mentalizing brain network
,,,,,,,,1,,Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Primary Care: Exploratory Qualitative Study of UK General Practitioners' Views.,"BACKGROUND: The potential for machine learning to disrupt the medical profession is the subject of ongoing debate within biomedical informatics and related fields. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore general practitioners' (GPs') opinions about the potential impact of future technology on key tasks in primary care. METHODS: In June 2018, we conducted a Web-based survey of 720 UK GPs' opinions about the likelihood of future technology to fully replace GPs in performing 6 key primary care tasks, and, if respondents considered replacement for a particular task likely, to estimate how soon the technological capacity might emerge. This study involved qualitative descriptive analysis of written responses (""comments"") to an open-ended question in the survey. RESULTS: Comments were classified into 3 major categories in relation to primary care: (1) limitations of future technology, (2) potential benefits of future technology, and (3) social and ethical concerns. Perceived limitations included the beliefs that communication and empathy are exclusively human competencies; many GPs also considered clinical reasoning and the ability to provide value-based care as necessitating physicians' judgments. Perceived benefits of technology included expectations about improved efficiencies, in particular with respect to the reduction of administrative burdens on physicians. Social and ethical concerns encompassed multiple, divergent themes including the need to train more doctors to overcome workforce shortfalls and misgivings about the acceptability of future technology to patients. However, some GPs believed that the failure to adopt technological innovations could incur harms to both patients and physicians. CONCLUSIONS: This study presents timely information on physicians' views about the scope of artificial intelligence (AI) in primary care. Overwhelmingly, GPs considered the potential of AI to be limited. These views differ from the predictions of biomedical informaticians. More extensive, stand-alone qualitative work would provide a more in-depth understanding of GPs' views.",0,1,0,0,0,1,journalArticle,2019,Blease C; Kaptchuk TJ; Bernstein MH; Mandl KD; Halamka JD; DesRoches CM,Journal of medical Internet research,,1439-4456,FNEJ4P7S,,,2019-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:21:43Z,2021-02-15T22:21:43Z,,,,3,21,,,Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Primary Care,,,,,,,English,,,,,Open WorldCat,,OCLC: 8028513010,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WorldCat,artificial intelligence and the future of primary care: exploratory qualitative study of uk general practitioners' views.,artificial intelligence and the future of primary care exploratory qualitative study of uk general practitioners views
,,,,,,,,1,,Method for Improving EEG Based Emotion Recognition by Combining It with Synchronized Biometric and Eye Tracking Technologies in a Non-invasive and Low Cost Way.,"Technical advances, particularly the integration of wearable and embedded sensors, facilitate tracking of physiological responses in a less intrusive way. Currently, there are many devices that allow gathering biometric measurements from human beings, such as EEG Headsets or Health Bracelets. The massive data sets generated by tracking of EEG and physiology may be used, among other things, to infer knowledge about human moods and emotions. Apart from direct biometric signal measurement, eye tracking systems are nowadays capable of determining the point of gaze of the users when interacting in ICT environments, which provides an added value research on many different areas, such as psychology or marketing. We present a process in which devices for eye tracking, biometric, and EEG signal measurements are synchronously used for studying both basic and complex emotions. We selected the least intrusive devices for different signal data collection given the study requirements and cost constraints, so users would behave in the most natural way possible. On the one hand, we have been able to determine basic emotions participants were experiencing by means of valence and arousal. On the other hand, a complex emotion such as empathy has also been detected. To validate the usefulness of this approach, a study involving forty-four people has been carried out, where they were exposed to a series of affective stimuli while their EEG activity, biometric signals, and eye position were synchronously recorded to detect self-regulation. The hypothesis of the work was that people who self-regulated would show significantly different results when analyzing their EEG data. Participants were divided into two groups depending on whether Electro Dermal Activity (EDA) data indicated they self-regulated or not. The comparison of the results obtained using different machine learning algorithms for emotion recognition shows that using EEG activity alone as a predictor for self-regulation does not allow properly determining whether a person in self-regulation its emotions while watching affective stimuli. However, adequately combining different data sources in a synchronous way to detect emotions makes it possible to overcome the limitations of single detection methods.",0,1,0,0,0,1,journalArticle,2016,López-Gil JM; Virgili-Gomá J; Gil R; García R,Frontiers in computational neuroscience,,1662-5188,FRWJ993Z,,,2016-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:21:43Z,2021-02-15T22:21:43Z,,,,,10,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Open WorldCat,,OCLC: 6810599341,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WorldCat,method for improving eeg based emotion recognition by combining it with synchronized biometric and eye tracking technologies in a non-invasive and low cost way.,method for improving eeg based emotion recognition by combining it with synchronized biometric and eye tracking technologies in a noninvasive and low cost way

We used a machine learning method for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to uncover complex genotypic-phenotypic networks and environmental interactions. The Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) measured the self-regulatory components of personality critical for health (i.e., the character traits of self-directedness, cooperativeness, and self-transcendence). In a discovery sample of 2149 healthy Finns, we identified sets of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that cluster within particular individuals (i.e., SNP sets) regardless of phenotype. Second, we identified five clusters of people with distinct profiles of character traits regardless of genotype. Third, we found 42 SNP sets that identified 727 gene loci and were significantly associated with one or more of the character profiles. Each character profile was related to different SNP sets with distinct molecular processes and neuronal functions. Environmental influences measured in childhood and adulthood had small but significant effects. We confirmed the replicability of 95% of the 42 SNP sets in healthy Korean and German samples, as well as their associations with character. The identified SNPs explained nearly all the heritability expected for character in each sample (50 to 58%). We conclude that self-regulatory personality traits are strongly influenced by organized interactions among more than 700 genes despite variable cultures and environments. These gene sets modulate specific molecular processes in brain for intentional goal-setting, self-reflection, empathy, and episodic learning and memory.",0,1,0,0,0,1,journalArticle,2020,Zwir I; Arnedo J; Del-Val C; Pulkki-Råback L; Konte B; Yang SS; Romero-Zaliz R; Hintsanen M; Cloninger KM; Garcia D; Svrakic DM; Rozsa S; Martinez M; Lyytikäinen LP; Giegling I; Kähönen M; Hernandez-Cuervo H; Seppälä I; Raitoharju E; de Erausquin GA; Raitakari O; Rujescu D; Postolache TT; Sung J; Keltikangas-Järvinen L; Lehtimäki T; Cloninger CR,Molecular psychiatry,,1359-4184,2X92QTLP,,,2020-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:21:43Z,2021-02-15T22:21:43Z,,2295-2312,,10,25,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Open WorldCat,,OCLC: 7863914188,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WorldCat,uncovering the complex genetics of human character.,uncovering the complex genetics of human character
,,,,,,,,1,,Deep learning identifies partially overlapping subnetworks in the human social brain.,"Complex social interplay is a defining property of the human species. In social neuroscience, many experiments have sought to first define and then locate 'perspective taking', 'empathy', and other psychological concepts to specific brain circuits. Seldom, bottom-up studies were conducted to first identify explanatory patterns of brain variation, which are then related to psychological concepts; perhaps due to a lack of large population datasets. In this spirit, we performed a systematic de-construction of social brain morphology into its elementary building blocks, involving ~10,000 UK Biobank participants. We explored coherent representations of structural co-variation at population scale within a recent social brain atlas, by translating autoencoder neural networks from deep learning. The learned subnetworks revealed essential patterns of structural relationships between social brain regions, with the nucleus accumbens, medial prefrontal cortex, and temporoparietal junction embedded at the core. Some of the uncovered subnetworks contributed to predicting examined social traits in general, while other subnetworks helped predict specific facets of social functioning, such as the experience of social isolation. As a consequence of our population-level evidence, spatially overlapping subsystems of the social brain probably relate to interindividual differences in everyday social life.",0,1,0,0,0,1,journalArticle,2021,Kiesow H; Spreng RN; Holmes AJ; Chakravarty MM; Marquand AF; Yeo BTT; Bzdok D,Communications biology,,,YAVAEPC2,,,2021-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:22:36Z,2021-02-15T22:22:36Z,,,,1,4,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Open WorldCat,,OCLC: 8881420050,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WorldCat,deep learning identifies partially overlapping subnetworks in the human social brain.,deep learning identifies partially overlapping subnetworks in the human social brain
,,,,,,,,1,,Transcendent Medicine and Deep Medicine Paradigm,"Background: Very recently, Eric Topol, a physician-scientist, introduced his “deep medicine” theory in 2019. This theory has been originated from the last two decades advancements of systems medicine and digital medicine, science and technology convergence in biological fields and formation of the precision medicine. The transcendent medicine theory that has been derived from Sadr ad-Din Shirazi’s transcendent theosophy looks to medicine with a holistic view.Materials and Methods: In extension of the theory of Transcendent medicine, we discussed paradigm shift in medicine with deep medicine theory and its three components were challenged via the viewpoints of transcendent medicine.Results: The body theosophy which has been derived from the transcendent medicine theory is the counterpart of “deep phenotyping” component of deep medicine. The speculative reason of Ibn-Sins’s science of soul which has been projected in transcendent medicine theory could be compare with “deep learning” component of deep medicine theory. With extraction of Ibn-Arabi’s concept of perfect man and its integration with transcendent medicine, the advanced model this theory could present “deep empathy”, the third component of deep medicine.Conclusion: The transcendent medicine theory expresses all three components of deep medicine in a unique form. Hence, this theory could be used as a tool in the paradigm shift of modern medicine.",0,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2020,,Iranian South Medical Journal,,1735-4374,XVYIEBRZ,,,2020-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:22:36Z,2021-02-15T22:22:36Z,,70-86,,1,23,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Open WorldCat,,OCLC: 8580238094,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WorldCat,transcendent medicine and deep medicine paradigm,transcendent medicine and deep medicine paradigm

Empathy entails an ability to see and feel the world from another’s perspective—feeling with rather than feeling for. Jake Sully’s identity as shifting, and boundary-crossing, makes him an especially good candidate for empathic cultivation. Sully assumes an avatar identity, stepping into a Na’vi form but also trying on a range of different perspectives, as part of his education in empathy and his spiritual transformation. The film sheds light on the complexity, fragility, and dangers of empathy, as well as its potential as an environmental and humanitarian value. Avatar suggests empathy’s perils, but also illustrates that empathy, properly oriented and cultivated, is an important environmental disposition encouraging appreciation of otherness.",0,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2010,"Sideris, Lisa","JSRNC Journal for the Study of Religion, Nature and Culture",,,3D3NK6VN,,,2010-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:24:01Z,2021-02-15T22:24:01Z,,457-477,,,4,,,I See You,,,,,,,English,,,,,Open WorldCat,,OCLC: 5847392461,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WorldCat,i see you: interspecies empathy and 'avatar',i see you interspecies empathy and avatar

We report on the design and evaluation of an affective avatar aimed at engaging the user in a social interaction with the purpose of assisting in communication therapies. A human-avatar taxonomy is proposed to assist the design of affective avatars aimed at addressing social communication disorder. The avatar was evaluated with 30 subjects to assess how effectively it conveys the desired emotion and elicits empathy from the user. Results provide evidence that users become used to the avatar after a number of interactions, and they perceive the defined behavior as being logical.

Participants completed a third-person visual perspective-taking task in which they judged the perspectives of two simultaneously presented avatars, designated ""Self"" and ""Other."" Depending on the trial, these avatars either held the same view (i.e., congruent) or a different view (i.e., incongruent). Analyses focused on the relationship between empathy and two perspective-taking phenomena: Selection between competing perspectives (i.e., perspective-congruence effects) and prioritization of the Self avatar's perspective. Empathy was related to improved overall performance on this task and a reduced cost of selecting between conflicting perspectives (i.e., smaller perspective-congruence effects). This effect was asymmetric, with empathy (i.e., empathic concern) levels predicting reduced interference from a conflicting perspective, especially when adopting the Self (vs. Other) avatar's perspective.

,,,,,,,,1,,EEVEE: the Empathy-Enhancing Virtual Evolving Environment.,"Empathy is a multifaceted emotional and mental faculty that is often found to be affected in a great number of psychopathologies, such as schizophrenia, yet it remains very difficult to measure in an ecological context. The challenge stems partly from the complexity and fluidity of this social process, but also from its covert nature. One powerful tool to enhance experimental control over such dynamic social interactions has been the use of avatars in virtual reality (VR); information about an individual in such an interaction can be collected through the analysis of his or her neurophysiological and behavioral responses. We have developed a unique platform, the Empathy-Enhancing Virtual Evolving Environment (EEVEE), which is built around three main components: (1) different avatars capable of expressing feelings and emotions at various levels based on the Facial Action Coding System (FACS); (2) systems for measuring the physiological responses of the observer (heart and respiration rate, skin conductance, gaze and eye movements, facial expression); and (3) a multimodal interface linking the avatar's behavior to the observer's neurophysiological response. In this article, we provide a detailed description of the components of this innovative platform and validation data from the first phases of development. Our data show that healthy adults can discriminate different negative emotions, including pain, expressed by avatars at varying intensities. We also provide evidence that masking part of an avatar's face (top or bottom half) does not prevent the detection of different levels of pain. This innovative and flexible platform provides a unique tool to study and even modulate empathy in a comprehensive and ecological manner in various populations, notably individuals suffering from neurological or psychiatric disorders.",1,1,0,0,0,1,journalArticle,2015,Jackson PL; Michon PE; Geslin E; Carignan M; Beaudoin D,Frontiers in human neuroscience,,1662-5161,DY5FH6K5,,,2015-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:24:01Z,2021-02-15T22:24:01Z,,,,,9,,,EEVEE,,,,,,,English,,,,,Open WorldCat,,OCLC: 5797948152,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WorldCat,eevee: the empathy-enhancing virtual evolving environment.,eevee the empathyenhancing virtual evolving environment

It focuses on whether people feel more empathy toward the pain of a virtual human when the virtual human is a realistic representation of a known individual, as opposed to an unknown person, and if social presence is related to users' empathy toward a virtual human's pain. The 42 participants were immersed in virtual reality using a large immersive cube with images retro projected on all six faces (CAVE-Like system) where they can interact in real time with virtual characters. The first immersion (baseline/control) was with a virtual animal, followed by immersions involving discussions with a known virtual human (i.e., the avatar of a person they were familiar with) or an unknown virtual human. During the verbal exchanges in virtual reality, the virtual humans expressed acute and very strong pain. The pain reactions were identical in terms of facial expressions, and verbal and nonverbal behaviors. The Conditions by Time interactions in the repeated measures analyses of variance revealed that participants were empathic toward both virtual humans, yet more empathic toward the known virtual human.

,,,,,,,,1,,Suppression of Sensorimotor Alpha Power Associated With Pain Expressed by an Avatar: A Preliminary EEG Study.,"Several studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) showed that empathic capabilities are associated with the activation (and deactivation) of relatively specific neural circuits. A growing number of electroencephalography studies also suggest that it might be useful to assess empathy. The main goal of this study was to use quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) to test whether observation of pain expressed by an avatar (virtual reality) induces a suppression of alpha waves over sensorimotor cortical areas, as it is observed with human stimuli. Not only was it the case, but also the magnitude of alpha suppression was correlated with perspective-taking capacity of participants. Both empathy levels and magnitude of sensorimotor alpha suppression (SAS) were significantly higher in women than men. Interestingly, a significant interaction emerged between levels of individual empathy and specificity of experimental instructions, where SAS in participants with good perspective-taking was higher during passive observation of the distressed avatar, while the opposite was true during an active (trying to understand) condition. These results suggest that: (1) synthetic characters are able to elicit SAS; (2) SAS is indeed associated with perspective-taking capacities; (3) Persons with poorer perspective-taking capacities can show significant SAS when proper instructions are provided. Therefore, qEEG represents a low-cost objective approach to measure perspective-taking abilities.",0,1,0,0,0,1,journalArticle,2018,Joyal CC; Neveu SM; Boukhalfi T; Jackson PL; Renaud P,Frontiers in human neuroscience,,1662-5161,NBL3AEPX,,,2018-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:24:17Z,2021-02-15T22:24:17Z,,,,,12,,,Suppression of Sensorimotor Alpha Power Associated With Pain Expressed by an Avatar,,,,,,,English,,,,,Open WorldCat,,OCLC: 7787364948,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WorldCat,suppression of sensorimotor alpha power associated with pain expressed by an avatar: a preliminary eeg study.,suppression of sensorimotor alpha power associated with pain expressed by an avatar a preliminary eeg study

For the first time, immersive virtual reality was used to place parents in the position of a child in order to assess impact on perspective-taking and empathy. This novel study was conducted with 20 non-high risk Spanish mothers (a pilot study with 12 mothers is reported in supplementary files). Mothers were virtually embodied as a 4-year-old child, experienced from the first-person perspective and with virtual and real body movements synchronised. They interacted with a 'mother avatar', which responded either in a Positive or Negative way. Participants reported a strong body ownership illusion for the child body that led to cognitive, emotional and physical reactions. Experiencing negative maternal behavior increased levels of empathy. In addition, the Negative mother led to increased feelings of fear of violence. Physiological data indicated greater stress in the Negative than Positive condition.

In the current study, we explored the relationship between visuospatial perspective taking and self-report measures of the cognitive and emotional components of empathy in young adults. To this aim, we employed a priming paradigm, in which the presence of an avatar allowed to anticipate the next perceived perspective on the visual scene. We found that the emotional dimension of empathy was positively correlated with the behavioral advantage provided by the presence of the avatar, relative to unprimed perspective changes.

A Reanalysis of Gabbiadini et al. 2016.","Gabbiadini, A., Riva, P., Andrighetto, L., Volpato, C., & Bushman, B, (PloS ONE, 2016) provided evidence for a connection between ""sexist"" video games and decreased empathy toward girls using an experimental paradigm. These claims are based on a moderated mediation model. They reported a three-way interaction between game condition, gender, and avatar identification when predicting masculine ideology in their original study. Masculine ideology was associated, in turn, with decreased empathy. However, there were no main experimental effects for video game condition on empathy. The current analysis considers the strength of the evidence for claims made in the original study on a sample of 153 adolescents (M age = 16.812, SD = 1.241; 44.2% male). We confirmed that there was little evidence for an overall effect of game condition on empathy toward girls or women. We tested the robustness of the original reported moderated mediation models against other, theoretically derived alternatives, and found that effects differed based on how variables were measured (using alternatives in their public data file) and the statistical model used. The experimental groups differed significantly and substantially in terms of age suggesting that there might have been issues with the procedures used to randomly assign participants to conditions. These results highlight the need for preregistration of experimental protocols in video game research and raise some concerns about how moderated mediation models are used to support causal inferences.

,,,,,,,,1,,Exploring the Effect of Cooperation in Reducing Implicit Racial Bias and Its Relationship With Dispositional Empathy and Political Attitudes.,"Previous research using immersive virtual reality (VR) has shown that after a short period of embodiment by White people in a Black virtual body, their implicit racial bias against Black people diminishes. Here we tested the effects of some socio-cognitive variables that could contribute to enhancing or reducing the implicit racial bias. The first aim of the study was to assess the beneficial effects of cooperation within a VR scenario, the second aim was to provide preliminary testing of the hypothesis that empathy and political attitudes could contribute to implicit bias about race, while the third aim was to explore the relationship between political attitudes and empathy. We had (Caucasian) participants embodied in a Black virtual body and engaged either in a cooperative (Coop group) or in a non-cooperative (Neutral group) activity with a confederate experimenter embodying another Black avatar. Before and after VR, we measured participants' implicit racial bias by means of Implicit Association Test (IAT) and their perceived closeness toward the confederate experimenter. Before VR we also assessed participants' political attitudes and empathy traits. Results revealed that, as compared to the Neutral group, the Coop group showed lower IAT scores after the social interaction. Interestingly, in the Neutral but not the Coop group the perceived closeness toward the confederate experimenter was associated with the initial racial bias: the more the participants reduced their distance, the more they reduced their IAT score. Moreover, reported traits of empathy and political attitudes significantly explained the variance observed in the initial implicit bias, with perspective-taking, empathic concern, and personal distress being significant predictors of the IAT scores. Finally, there was a relationship between political attitudes and empathy: the more participants considered themselves as left-wing voters, the higher their perspective-taking and empathic concern scores. We discuss these findings within the neuroscientific and social cognition field and encourage scholars from different domains to further explore whether and under which conditions a given manipulation for reducing racial bias could be efficiently transposed in VR.",0,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2020,Patané I; Lelgouarch A; Banakou D; Verdelet G; Desoche C; Koun E; Salemme R; Slater M; Farnè A,Frontiers in psychology,,1664-1078,22E8FJR2,,,2020-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:24:46Z,2021-02-15T22:24:46Z,,,,,11,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Open WorldCat,,OCLC: 8698096714,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WorldCat,exploring the effect of cooperation in reducing implicit racial bias and its relationship with dispositional empathy and political attitudes.,exploring the effect of cooperation in reducing implicit racial bias and its relationship with dispositional empathy and political attitudes

,,,,,,,,1,,Open Interactivity: A Model for Audience Agency,"Artists have increasingly acknowledged the role of the audience as collaborators both in the construction of meaning (Bathes, 1977), through subjective experience (Dewey, 1934) and in contributing to the creative act by externalising the work. (Duchamp) Lucy Lippard identifies 1966-72 as a period where artists turned increasingly towards the audience, representing a ""dematerialization of the art object"" (Lippard, 1997) through ""Happenings"" and ""Fluxus"" movements. Digital media has facilitated this trajectory, implicit in the interactive computer interface (Manovich, 2005), but interactivity per se may offer no more than a series of choices put forward by the artist (Daniels, 2011). Interactivity represents interplay between artist and audience (Dinka, 1996) and is potentially a process of audience empowerment to offer agency, defined as real and creative choice (Browning, 1964).<br><br>Public screen installation ""Peoples Screen"" Guangzhou, linking China to Perth Australia (Sermon & Gould, 2015) offered a partnership between artist and audience to co-create content though playful narratives and active engagement in a drama that unfolds using improvisation and play. Initially visitors enjoy observing the self on the screen but audiences quickly start to interact with the environment and other participants. Immersed in play they lose a sense of the self (Callois, 2011) and enter a virtual third space where possibilities for creativity and direction of play are limitless. The self becomes an avatar where the audience can inhabit ""the other"" thereby exploring alternative realities through ludic play, promoting tolerance and empathy and developing collective memory.",0,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2018,,IAFOR Journal of Cultural Studies,,2187-4905,VADGG8RC,,,2018-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:24:46Z,2021-02-15T22:24:46Z,,55-69,,1,3,,,Open Interactivity,,,,,,,English,,,,,Open WorldCat,,OCLC: 7655511608,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WorldCat,open interactivity: a model for audience agency,open interactivity a model for audience agency
,,,,,,,,1,,Seeing the mind of robots: Harm augments mind perception but benevolent intentions reduce dehumanisation of artificial entities in visual vignettes.,"According to moral typecasting theory, good- and evil-doers (agents) interact with the recipients of their actions (patients) in a moral dyad. When this dyad is completed, mind attribution towards intentionally harmed liminal minds is enhanced. However, from a dehumanisation view, malevolent actions may instead result in a denial of humanness. To contrast both accounts, a visual vignette experiment (N = 253) depicted either malevolent or benevolent intentions towards robotic or human avatars. Additionally, we examined the role of harm-salience by showing patients as either harmed, or still unharmed. The results revealed significantly increased mind attribution towards visibly harmed patients, mediated by perceived pain and expressed empathy. Benevolent and malevolent intentions were evaluated respectively as morally right or wrong, but their impact on the patient was diminished for the robotic avatar. Contrary to dehumanisation predictions, our manipulation of intentions failed to affect mind perception. Nonetheless, benevolent intentions reduced dehumanisation of the patients. Moreover, when pain and empathy were statistically controlled, the effect of intentions on mind perception was mediated by dehumanisation. These findings suggest that perceived intentions might only be indirectly tied to mind perception, and that their role may be better understood when additionally accounting for empathy and dehumanisation.",0,1,0,0,0,1,journalArticle,2020,Küster D; Swiderska A,International journal of psychology : Journal international de psychologie,,0020-7594,49UTDP7R,,,2020-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:24:46Z,2021-02-15T22:24:46Z,,,,,,,,Seeing the mind of robots,,,,,,,English,,,,,Open WorldCat,,OCLC: 8664634571,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WorldCat,seeing the mind of robots: harm augments mind perception but benevolent intentions reduce dehumanisation of artificial entities in visual vignettes.,seeing the mind of robots harm augments mind perception but benevolent intentions reduce dehumanisation of artificial entities in visual vignettes
,,,,,,,,1,,Submentalizing or mentalizing in a Level 1 perspective-taking task: A cloak and goggles test.,"It has been proposed that humans possess an automatic system to represent mental states ('implicit mentalizing'). The existence of an implicit mentalizing system has generated considerable debate however, centered on the ability of various experimental paradigms to demonstrate unambiguously such mentalizing. Evidence for implicit mentalizing has previously been provided by the 'dot perspective task,' where participants are slower to verify the number of dots they can see when an avatar can see a different number of dots. However, recent evidence challenged a mentalizing interpretation of this effect by showing it was unaltered when the avatar was replaced with an inanimate arrow stimulus. Here we present an extension of the dot perspective task using an invisibility cloaking device to render the dots invisible on certain trials. This paradigm is capable of providing unambiguous evidence of automatic mentalizing, but no such evidence was found. Two further well-powered experiments used opaque and transparent goggles to manipulate visibility but found no evidence of automatic mentalizing, nor of individual differences in empathy or perspective-taking predicting performance, contradicting previous studies using the same design. The results cast doubt on the existence of an implicit mentalizing system, suggesting that previous effects were due to domain-general processes.

,,,,,,,,1,,The Ethics of Mislocalized Selfhood,"In Psychology, ‘proprioceptive drift’ is a term that originates from the rubber hand illusion paradigm to describe the ‘relative displacement of the perceived location of one’s own hand toward the location of the rubber hand’ (Wold et al, 2014). Correspondingly, drift measurements in science are used as a means of rating the intensity of a body-ownership illusion via which a participant in a controlled experiment perceives that an extracorporeal appendage, or virtual whole-body avatar is incorporated as part of one’s own body schema. In this research article, I will examine an applied performance by BeAnotherLab utilising the anti-disciplinary collective’s The Machine to Be Another as part of Good Chance’s Encampment project - this telepresence system produces a VR body illusion intended to increase empathy and reduce proximity between an immersant’s real body and that of a volunteer refugee counterpart. When scientifically-tested body illusions cross a paradigmatic boundary to be framed as immersive art, what are the ethical implications? Furthermore, are these kinds of virtual proprioceptive transactions across different kinds of social and political boundaries symptomatic of radical empathic acts, or a capitalistic desire for the acquisition of another’s experiences by virtual means? This article examines illusory bodily inhabitation through a Levinasian critical lens to consider the ethics of deterritorializing the immersant’s gaze and referring their sense of touch elsewhere to produce ‘narrative immersion’.",0,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2017,"Jarvis, Liam",Performance Research,,1352-8165,SBX3BI4S,,,2017-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:24:46Z,2021-02-15T22:24:46Z,,30-37,,3,22,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Open WorldCat,,OCLC: 7138533628,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WorldCat,the ethics of mislocalized selfhood,the ethics of mislocalized selfhood
,,,,,,,,1,,Disturbances of spontaneous empathic processing relate with the severity of the negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia: a behavioural pilot-study using virtual reality technology.,"Behavioural and neuroimaging data have recently pointed out that empathy (feeling into someone else) is associated with mental imagery and transformation related to one's and other's visuo-spatial perspectives. Impairments of both empathic and visuo-spatial abilities have been observed in patients with schizophrenia. Especially, it has been suggested that schizophrenics are altered in spontaneously simulating another individual's first-person experience. However, there is so far only little evidence regarding the relationship between deficits in empathy and disturbances in spontaneous heterocentered coding in schizophrenia. In the present pilot-study, we tested with schizophrenic patients our behavioural paradigm that enables to measure from the bodily postures and movements whether individuals in ecologically more valid conditions are interacting with another individual by using egocentered - as in sympathy (feeling with someone else) - or heterocentered - as in empathy - visuo-spatial mechanisms. For that, ten patients and ten controls, standing and moving, interacted with a virtual tightrope walker, displayed life-sized, standing and moving as well. We show that patients with higher negative symptoms had, in most cases, deficits in spontaneously using heterocentered visuo-spatial mechanisms and employed preferentially an egocentered referencing to interact with the avatar. In contrast, preserved spontaneous heterocentered visuo-spatial strategies were not linked to a prevailing negative or positive symptomatology. Our data suggest that the severity of the negative symptoms in schizophrenia relates with disturbances of spontaneous (""on-line"") empathic processing in association with lower scoring self-reported trait cognitive empathy.",0,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2014,Thirioux B; Tandonnet L; Jaafari N; Berthoz A,Brain and cognition,,0278-2626,VTZ5F9JD,,,2014-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:24:58Z,2021-02-15T22:24:58Z,,87-99,,,90,,,Disturbances of spontaneous empathic processing relate with the severity of the negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia,,,,,,,English,,,,,Open WorldCat,,OCLC: 5626805970,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WorldCat,disturbances of spontaneous empathic processing relate with the severity of the negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia: a behavioural pilot-study using virtual reality technology.,disturbances of spontaneous empathic processing relate with the severity of the negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia a behavioural pilotstudy using virtual reality technology
,,,,,,,,1,,Using a Virtual Reality Social Network During Awake Craniotomy to Map Social Cognition: Prospective Trial.,"BACKGROUND: In awake craniotomy, it is possible to temporarily inactivate regions of the brain using direct electrical stimulation, while the patient performs neuropsychological tasks. If the patient shows decreased performance in a given task, the neurosurgeon will not remove these regions, so as to maintain all brain functions. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to describe our experience of using a virtual reality (VR) social network during awake craniotomy and discuss its future applications for perioperative mapping of nonverbal language, empathy, and theory of mind. METHODS: This was a single-center, prospective, unblinded trial. During wound closure, different VR experiences with a VR headset were proposed to the patient. This project sought to explore interactions with the neuropsychologist's avatar in virtual locations using a VR social network as an available experience. RESULTS: Three patients experienced VR. Despite some limitations due to patient positioning during the operation and the limitation of nonverbal cues inherent to the app, the neuropsychologist, as an avatar, could communicate with the patient and explore gesture communication while wearing a VR headset. CONCLUSIONS: With some improvements, VR social networks can be used in the near future to map social cognition during awake craniotomy.

The empirical un­ derstanding of the drivers of visitors’ intentions to use robots in such services has become an urgent necessity for their sustainable deployment. Certainly, using social androids within hospitality services requires organisations’ attentive commitment to value creation and fulfilling service quality expectations. In this paper, via structural equation modelling (SEM) and semi-structured interviews with managers, we conceptualise and empirically test visitors’ intentions to use social robots in hospitality services. With data collected in Singapore’s hospitality settings, we found visitors’ intentions to use social robots stem from the effects of technology acceptance vari­ ables, service quality dimensions leading to perceived value, and two further dimensions from human robot interaction (HRI): empathy and information sharing.

Social referencing occurs when infants perceive their parents' facial expressions and vocal tones of emotional situations to form their own interpretation.

The robot's function is to increase people's awareness to the effect of their behavior towards others, potentially leading to behavior change. Specifically, Kip1 is designed to promote non-aggressive conversation between people. It monitors the conversation's nonverbal aspects and maintains an emotional model of its reaction to the conversation. If the conversation seems calm, Kip1 responds by a gesture designed to communicate curious interest. If the conversation seems aggressive, Kip1 responds by a gesture designed to communicate fear. We describe the design process of Kip1, guided by the principles of peripheral and evocative. We detail its hardware and software systems, and a study evaluating the effects of the robot's autonomous behavior on couples' conversations. We find support for our design goals. A conversation companion reacting to the conversation led to more gaze attention, but not more verbal distraction, compared to a robot that moves but does not react to the conversation.

While quite some progress has been made in e.g. speech or emotion understanding, processing and expressing, the relations between humans and robots are usually only short-term. In order to build long-term, i.e. social relations, qualities like empathy, trust building, dependability, non-patronizing, and others will be required. But these are just terms and as such no adequate starting points to “program” these capacities even more how to avoid the problems and pitfalls in interactions between humans and robots.

Although this promises to deliver increased speed and accuracy, the future role of AI in relation to radiotherapy should be thought through carefully. There is currently a gap between published developments and widespread adoption, which provides some space to prepare the workforce and to consider the implications on practice. It is rare to find philosophical input into a medical journal, but the advent of AI makes this perspective increasingly important. Philosophical insight can help explore the potential impact of AI, in particular, on human creativity and oversight. Without this perspective, we run the risk of focusing solely on the immediate logistical impact on patients and departments. This commentary identifies three key aspects of radiotherapy that the authors feel would suffer most under AI control: creativity, innovation, and patient safety, which all demand uniquely human attributes. The article also provides insight from a philosophical perspective with regard to human consciousness, ethics, and empathy. Philosophically we should, perhaps, retain ethical concerns about the widening role of AI in radiotherapy beyond simple quantitative interpretation and image processing. As developments continue, we have time to determine how our roles will evolve and to establish a framework for ensuring appropriate human input into patient care.

Through mining these data, predictive models can be built to forecast and analyze potential mental illness, which can facilitate therapeutic decision making and offer the best hope for early interventions and treatments. However, most existing approaches face severe information loss and ignore the time dynamics of user behaviour. To fill the research gaps, we use time-aware social networks to combine various information sources in social media posts. Also, machine learning detectors are trained to automatically identify empathic interactions, filter out irrelevant information and construct empathy-based networks. Finally, we devise a hybrid deep learning algorithm to learn embeddings from the dynamic feature-rich networks and predict future alleviation of mental illness.

The researchers aim to gather practical knowledge regarding tourists' intentions for such service enhancements, which may drive the sector to adopt a better conclusive growth pattern in post-COVID-19 times. In this study, we attempt to focus on travelers who look for paramount safety with the assurance of empathetic, personalized care in post-COVID-19 times. In the current study, the authors employ structural equation modeling to evaluate the intentions of tourists both structurally and empirically for destination tourism with data collected from tourists with previous exposure to various kinds of these devices. The study shows that human-machine interactive devices are integrating AI and VR and have a significant effect on overall service quality, leading to tourist satisfaction and loyalty. The use of such social interactive gadgets within tourism and mostly in hospitality services requires an organization to make a commitment to futuristic technologies, along with building value by enriching service quality expectations among fearful tourists. This research shows that tourists mainly focus on the use of such HMI devices from the perspective of technology acceptance factors, qualitative value-enhancing service and trustworthy information-sharing mechanisms. The concept of the tour bubble framework is also discussed in detail. The analysis of this discussion gives us a more profound understanding of the novel opportunities which various administrative agencies may benefit from to position these devices better in smart, sustainable destination tourism strategies for the future so that, collectively, service 5.0 with HMI devices can possibly bring back tourism from being disintegrated.

Mental health appears ripe for such disruption given the global illness burden, stigma, and shortage of care providers. Objective: To characterize the global psychiatrist community’s opinion regarding the potential of future autonomous technology (referred to here as AI/ML) to replace key tasks carried out in mental health practice. Design: Cross sectional, random stratiﬁed sample of psychiatrists registered with Sermo, a global networking platform open to veriﬁed and licensed physicians. Main outcome measures: We measured opinions about the likelihood that AI/ML tools would be able to fully replace – not just assist – the average psychiatrist in performing 10 key psychiatric tasks. Among those who considered replacement likely, we measured opinions about how many years from now such a capacity might emerge. We also measured psychiatrist’s perceptions about whether beneﬁts of AI/ML would outweigh the risks. Results: Survey respondents were 791 psychiatrists from 22 countries representing North America, South America, Europe and Asia-Paciﬁc. Only 3.8 % of respondents felt it was likely that future technology would make their jobs obsolete and only 17 % felt that future AI/ML was likely to replace a human clinician for providing empathetic care. Documenting and updating medical records (75 %) and synthesizing information (54 %) were the two tasks where a majority predicted that AI/ML could fully replace human psychiatrists. Female- and USbased doctors were more uncertain that the beneﬁts of AI would outweigh risks than male- and non-US doctors, respectively. Around one in 2 psychiatrists did however predict that their jobs would be substantially changed by AI/ML.

Despite significant progress towards the development of empathic social agents, current social robots have yet to reach the full emotional and social capabilities. This paper presents our recent effort on incorporating an automated Facial Expression Recognition (FER) system based on deep neural networks into the spoken dialog of a social robot (Ryan) to extend and enrich its capabilities beyond spoken dialog and integrate the user's affect state into the robot's responses. In order to evaluate whether this incorporation can improve social capabilities of Ryan, we conducted a series of Human-Robot-Interaction (HRI) experiments. In these experiments the subjects watched some videos and Ryan engaged them in a conversation driven by user's facial expressions perceived by the robot. We measured the accuracy of the automated FER system on the robot when interacting with different human subjects as well as three social/interactive aspects, namely task engagement, empathy, and likability of the robot. The results of our HRI study indicate that the subjects rated empathy and likability of the affect-aware Ryan significantly higher than non-empathic (the control condition) Ryan. Interestingly, we found that the accuracy of the FER system is not a limiting factor, as subjects rated the affect-aware agent equipped with a low accuracy FER system as empathic and likable as when facial expression was recognized by a human observer.",,0,0,0,0,0,conferencePaper,2018,"Mollahosseini, A.; Abdollahi, H.; Mahoor, M.

Human empathy toward a robot can be affected by the presence of a robot. Thus, we focused on the levels of agency and the physical embodiment of a robot, which are influential factors pertaining to social presence, by executing two experiments. In the first experiment, in a 2 (levels of agency: mediated vs. simulated) between-participants experiment, participants interacted with either a mediated robot which delivers the emotional state of a remote user or a simulated robot which expresses its own emotion. Participants empathized more with the mediated robot than with the simulated robot, demonstrating that the proper form of an emotional robot is as a mediator during emotional interaction between people. In the second study, in a 2 (physical embodiment: physically embodied vs. physically disembodied) between-participants experiment design, participants interacted with either a physically embodied robot or a physically disembodied robot.

To achieve this, robots must interact with people in natural ways, employing social mechanisms that people use while interacting with each other. One such mechanism is empathy, often seen as the basis of social cooperation and prosocial behaviour. We argue that artificial companions capable of behaving in an empathic manner, which involves the capacity to recognise another's affect and respond appropriately, are more successful at establishing and maintaining a positive relationship with users. This paper presents a study where an autonomous robot with empathic capabilities acts as a social companion to two players in a chess game. The robot reacts to the moves played on the chessboard by displaying several facial expressions and verbal utterances, showing empathic behaviours towards one player and behaving neutrally towards the other. Quantitative and qualitative results of 31 participants indicate that users towards whom the robot behaved empathically perceived the robot as friendlier, which supports our hypothesis that empathy plays a key role in human–robot interaction.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2013,"Leite, Iolanda; Pereira, André; Mascarenhas, Samuel; Martinho, Carlos; Prada, Rui; Paiva, Ana",International Journal of Human-Computer Studies,,1071-5819,M6U8GFHM,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhcs.2012.09.005,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1071581912001681,2013-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T21:45:53Z,2021-02-15T21:45:53Z,,250-260,,3,71,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Empathy; Social robots; Affective interactions; Artificial companions; Friendship,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Science Direct,the influence of empathy in human–robot relations,the influence of empathy in humanrobot relations

Recent neural conversation models that attempted to generate empathetic responses either focused on conditioning the output to a given emotion, or incorporating the current user emotional state. However, these approaches do not factor in how the user would feel towards the generated response. Hence, in this paper, we propose Sentiment Look-ahead, which is a novel perspective for empathy that models the future user emotional state. In short, Sentiment Look-ahead is a reward function under a reinforcement learning framework that provides a higher reward to the generative model when the generated utterance improves the user's sentiment. We implement and evaluate three different possible implementations of sentiment look-ahead and empirically show that our proposed approach can generate significantly more empathetic, relevant, and fluent responses than other competitive baselines such as multitask learning.",,0,0,0,0,0,conferencePaper,2020,"Shin, J.; Xu, P.; Madotto, A.; Fung, P.","ICASSP 2020 - 2020 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)",,,KIUAFYUD,10.1109/ICASSP40776.2020.9054379,,2020-05-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-11T03:37:19Z,2021-02-11T03:37:19Z,,7989-7993,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IEEE Xplore,,ISSN: 2379-190X,,,,generative model; learning (artificial intelligence); empathy; emotion recognition; Dialogue Systems; Empathetic Chatbots; generated utterance; human conversation difficult; Natural Language Processing; recent neural conversation models; reinforcement learning framework; sentiment look-ahead; Sentiment Look-ahead; speech processing; user emotional state,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ICASSP 2020 - 2020 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IEEE Xplore,generating empathetic responses by looking ahead the user’s sentiment,generating empathetic responses by looking ahead the users sentiment

Social cues are an important factor in this context. This work investigates, if emotional adaptation still works under absence of human-like facial Action Units. A human-robot dialog scenario is chosen using NAO pretending to work for a supermarket and involving humans providing object names to the robot for training purposes. In a user study, two conditions are implemented with or without explicit emotional adaptation of NAO to the human user in a between-subjects design. Evaluations of user experience and acceptance are conducted based on evaluated measures of human-robot interaction (HRI). The results of the user study reveal a significant increase of helpfulness (number of named objects), anthropomorphism, and empathy in the explicit emotional adaptation condition even without social cues of facial Action Units, but only in case of prior robot contact of the test persons.

Although the replacement of human counsellors remains a speculative prospect, chatbots for ‘narrow AI’ tasks (e.g., assessment and referral) are increasingly being used to augment clinical practice. Little research has addressed the possibilities for care that chatbots may generate in the future, particularly in the context of alcohol and other drug counselling. To explore these issues, we draw on the concept of technological ‘affordances’ and identify the range of possibilities for care that emerging chatbot interventions may afford and foreclose depending on the contexts in which they are implemented. Our analysis is based on qualitative data from interviews with clients (n=20) and focus group discussions with counsellors (n=8) conducted as part of a larger study of an Australian online alcohol and other drug counselling service. Both clients and counsellors expressed a concern that chatbot interventions lacked a ‘human’ element, which they valued in empathic care encounters. Most clients reported that they would share less information with a chatbot than a human counsellor, and they viewed this as constraining care. However, clients and counsellors suggested that the use of narrow AI might afford possibilities for performing discrete tasks, such as screening, triage or referral. In the context of what we refer to as ‘more-than-human’ care, our findings reveal complex views about the types of affordances that chatbots may produce and foreclose in online care encounters. We conclude by discussing implications for the potential ‘addiction futures’ and care trajectories that AI technologies offer, focussing on how they might inform alcohol and other drug policy, and the design of digital healthcare.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2020,"Barnett, Anthony; Savic, Michael; Pienaar, Kiran; Carter, Adrian; Warren, Narelle; Sandral, Emma; Manning, Victoria; Lubman, Dan I.",International Journal of Drug Policy,,9553959,BP6ZKNXI,10.1016/j.drugpo.2020.102910,https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0955395920302498,2020-10-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T21:44:16Z,2021-02-15T21:44:16Z,2021-02-15T21:44:16Z,102910,,,,,International Journal of Drug Policy,Enacting ‘more-than-human’ care,,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Science Direct,enacting ‘more-than-human’ care: clients’ and counsellors’ views on the multiple affordances of chatbots in alcohol and other drug counselling,enacting morethanhuman care clients and counsellors views on the multiple affordances of chatbots in alcohol and other drug counselling

In order to create empathy between human-robot, a robot must be able to estimate the emotion of human and reflect the same emotion on its expression. In general, emotion can be estimated based on observable expressions such as facial expression, or unobservable expressions such as biological signals. Although there are many methods for measuring emotion from both facial expression and biological signals, few studies have been done on the comparison of estimated emotion. In this paper, we investigate whether emotion estimated from facial expression or biological signals could lead to empathy toward a robot.

However, these techniques are less proven in sparse-data environments, and at present are more the subject of research than application. Typical implementations of ML and AI require a cross-disciplinary decision engine that, once “trained,” can cognitively respond to changes in input. The key to successful training is to a) have a defined decision-basis (answer-key), and/or b) facilitate sufficient learning, both of which require ample data (observability) and ample time for the machine to develop a logical outcome. Much research has been focused on developing decision algorithms using various logical formulations, dimensionality reductions, neural techniques, and learning reinforcements for tasks that traditionally require human intelligence. What is missing in most current research streams are implementations of ML and AI for decisions that are fundamentally rooted in human intuition and empathy, e.g., situations in which the decision requires a holistic view and the outcome is based on a qualitative judgement based on context and fact. This paper is intended to benefit a wide range of readers considering Artificial Intelligence, from the merely curious to “techies” from other disciplines to experienced practitioners and researchers.

For robots such as Nao, body language is the best medium available given their inability to convey facial expressions. Displaying emotional body language that can be interpreted whilst interacting with the robot should significantly improve its sociability. This research investigates the creation of an Affect Space for the generation of emotional body language to be displayed by robots. To create an Affect Space for body language, one has to establish the contribution of the different positions of the joints to the emotional expression. The experiment reported in this paper investigated the effect of varying a robot's head position on the interpretation, Valence, Arousal and Stance of emotional key poses. It was found that participants were better than chance level in interpreting the key poses. This finding confirms that body language is an appropriate medium for robot to express emotions. Moreover, the results of this study support the conclusion that Head Position is an important body posture variable. Head Position up increased correct identification for some emotion displays (pride, happiness, and excitement), whereas Head Position down increased correct identification for other displays (anger, sadness). Fear, however, was identified well regardless of Head Position. Head up was always evaluated as more highly Aroused than Head straight or down. Evaluations of Valence (degree of negativity to positivity) and Stance (degree to which the robot was aversive to approaching), however, depended on both Head Position and the emotion displayed.

Smartness is usually associated with efficiency, but it also allows environments, virtual humans and social robots to display emotions, empathy and provide environments to introduce and support humorous events. We review examples of playful and humorous street furniture in ‘playable’ cities and projects that allow residents and visitors to interact with objects and environments in playful and humorous ways. We add observations on humor theory, in particular observations that deal with physical, visual and multimodal humor. Our emphasis is on introducing incongruities and on exploring different forms of incongruities in order to introduce humorous situations. Inventories of incongruities are explored. These inventories have been obtained from observing humor in everyday situations, in comedies, in movies, and in TV commercials. Shortcomings of these inventories from the point of view of multimodal and interaction humor are discussed and some preliminary views on additional approaches are provided.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2015,"Nijholt, Anton",Procedia Manufacturing,,2351-9789,MMUHFSDL,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2015.07.358,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351978915003595,2015-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T21:45:53Z,2021-02-15T21:45:53Z,,2175-2182,,,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"<p>6th International Conference on Applied Human Factors and Ergonomics (AHFE 2015) and the Affiliated Conferences, AHFE 2015</p>",,Human-computer interaction; Computational humor; Incongruities; Playable cities,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Science Direct,designing humor for playable cities,designing humor for playable cities

We attempt to apply a sociological and psychological approach to understand the influence of robot beings, by observing human emotion and perception changes while subjects watched a funny video clip in the presence of a robot or a human companion, each of which made their own typical laughing sounds. From this experiment, we found that the robot did not affect the human's positive emotions as much as a human companion did, but the robot did discourage negative emotions. However, the subjects were, in general, amused when they were watching the video with the robot. This amusement is similar to the contagious effect of sharing humor with another human being.

However, the specific kinds of human-robot interactions that would arouse and enhance empathy for the robot in the user's mind have not yet been clarified. In addition, the human behavioral traits that may be regarded as indices of empathy have not been investigated extensively. In an attempt to address these two issues, a preliminary experiment on empathy in human-robot interaction is conducted.

In this study, we video-prototyped a user's interactions with a set of robotic drawers. The user and robot each displayed one of five emotional states - angry, happy, indifferent, sad, and timid. The results of our study indicated that the participants of our online questionnaire preferred empathetic drawers to neutral ones.

,,,,,,,,,,The Role of Animism Tendencies and Empathy in Adult Evaluations of Robot,"We investigated whether Japanese adults' beliefs about friendship and morality toward robots differing in appearance (i.e., humanoid, dog-like, and egg-shaped) related to their animism tendencies and empathy. University students responded to questionnaires regarding three animism tendencies (i.e., general animism or a tendency to believe souls or gods in nonliving things, aliveness animism or a tendency to consider nonliving things as live entities, and agentic animisms or a tendency to attribute biological, artifactual, psychological, perceptual, and naming properties) and empathy. We found that friendship and morality were related to slightly different animism tendencies and empathy even though they shared some major factors. Aliveness animism, as well as a tendency to attribute perceptual and name properties toward robots, might be necessary for an individual to believe that robots could be social agents. Participants who responded that robots could be their friends showed a tendency to feel a soul in manmade objects and a strong self-oriented emotional reactivity, whereas participants who answered that robots were moral beings showed a tendency to exhibit strong emotional susceptibility.

A 3x2 between-subject video-based survey experiment (N=133) was conducted with empathic robot behaviour (empathically accurate, neutral, inaccurate) and valence of the situation (positive, negative) as dimensions.

A comparison of empathy toward a physical and a simulated robot,"In designing and evaluating human-robot interactions and interfaces, researchers often use a simulated robot due to the high cost of robots and time required to program them. However, it is important to consider how interaction with a simulated robot differs from a real robot; that is, do simulated robots provide authentic interaction? We contribute to a growing body of work that explores this question and maps out simulated-versus-real differences, by explicitly investigating empathy: how people empathize with a physical or simulated robot when something bad happens to it. Our results suggest that people may empathize more with a physical robot than a simulated one, a finding that has important implications on the generalizability and applicability of simulated HRI work. Empathy is particularly relevant to social HRI and is integral to, for example, companion and care robots. Our contribution additionally includes an original and reproducible HRI experimental design to induce empathy toward robots in laboratory settings, and an experimentally validated empathy-measuring instrument from psychology for use with HRI.",,0,0,0,0,0,conferencePaper,2015,"Seo, Stela H.; Geiskkovitch, Denise; Nakane, Masayuki; King, Corey; Young, James E.",Proceedings of the Tenth Annual ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction,978-1-4503-2883-8,,SKDHD9CA,10.1145/2696454.2696471,https://doi.org/10.1145/2696454.2696471,2015-03-02T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T21:19:32Z,2021-02-15T21:19:32Z,2021-02-15T00:00:00Z,125–132,,,,,,Poor Thing!

Such a robot is one step forward towards industry 5.0, as it provides a theoretical framework to enable the performance of the robot to be customized to suit the needs of both the task as well as the operator. An inventive step is taken through the separation of computational resources based on whether the algorithms are addressing functional or experiential needs. The paper therefore addresses the requirement for new approaches that can be employed in the design of mobile robots to reduce cost, power consumption, and computational burden of the system. We propose that tasks requiring real-time and safety critical control are processed using dedicated on-board computers, whereas functionality dedicated to system optimization, machine learning and customization are handled through use a cloud-based platform.

However, there are still many open issues regarding the social capabilities that those robots should have in order to make daily interactions with humans more natural. For example, the role of affective interactions is still unclear. This paper presents an ethnographic study conducted in an elementary school where 40 children interacted with a social robot capable of recognising and responding empathically to some of the children's affective states. The findings suggest that the robot's empathic behaviour affected positively how children perceived the robot.

,,,,,,,,,,Modeling and Simulating Empathic Behavior in Social Assistive Robots,"Several studies report successful results on how social assistive robots can be employed as interface in the assisted living domain. In our opinion, to plan their response and interact successfully with people, it is crucial to recognize human emotions.

The domain is a virtual robotic tutor who is guiding and helping learners through a mobile Treasure Hunt exercise that tests their map reading skills. The contribution described in this paper is the discovery that incorporating 'memory' through utterances that recall events from previous interactions significantly increases the learner's ability to perform a pedagogical task. However, the virtual tutor with memory was perceived as less likeable and the instructions given as harder to follow than with a virtual tutor without memory. In addition, there was a significant drop in perceived empathy.

This perspective may need to be reconsidered, however, if some team members are autonomous robots since establishing bonds with fundamentally inanimate and expendable objects may prove counterproductive. Previous work has measured empathic responses towards robots as singular events at the conclusion of experimental sessions. As relationships extend over long periods of time, sustained empathic behavior towards robots would be of interest. In order to measure user actions that may vary over time and are affected by empathy towards a robot teammate, we created the TEAMMATE simulation system.

The Squeeze Me is a squeezable device used to grab attention from a robot, providing ground for expressive values to be shared. The expressions exerted on the mediating device by the human are mapped to expressive behaviors of the robot in the modality of motion in forthcoming interaction. We propose a double-layered interaction paradigm in achieving natural and socially acceptable synthesis. Firstly, a direct mapping, inherently exhibiting a natural relationship. Secondly, an amplifying and reductive mapping to construct a personalizing relationship through vivid and lively interactions fed by the intentions of the robot as well as the user. The design case serves to explore consequences of a phenomenological approach on the constitution of empathy in the fields of human and robot interaction.

More specifically, we study whether robots can induce prosocial behavior in humans through a 1x2 between-subjects user study (N=30) in which a confederate abused a robot. Through this study, we investigated whether the emotional reactions of a group of bystander robots could motivate a human to intervene in response to robot abuse. Our results show that participants were more likely to prosocially intervene when the bystander robots expressed sadness in response to the abuse as opposed to when they ignored these events, despite participants reporting similar perception of robot mistreatment and levels of empathy for the abused robot.

However, the ability to express empathy diminishes as people rely more and more on technological resources to interact. Due to fact of being an essential component to become a more effective social relationship between humans and computers, there are several approaches, techniques, methods or mechanisms to promote empathy in these interactions. This paper proposes to identify and systematize mechanisms used in Computer Science to promote empathy. Thus, it was carried out a systematic mapping on the main research databases of the area. We identified the main approaches used to promote empathy, such as Empathic Robotic Agent/Device and Empathic Virtual Agent, as well as the countries that hold the most research in this line, especially the United Kingdom, Japan and USA.

,,,,,,,,,,Good robot design or machiavellian? an in-the-wild robot leveraging minimal knowledge of passersby's culture,"Social robots are being designed to use human-like communication techniques, including body language, social signals, and empathy, to work effectively with people. Just as between people, some robots learn about people and adapt to them. In this paper we present one such robot design: we developed Sam, a robot that learns minimal information about a person's background, and adapts to this background. Our in-the-wild study found that people helped Sam for significantly longer when it adapted to match their background. While initially we saw this as a success, in re-considering our study we started seeing a different angle. Our robot effectively deceived people (changed its story and text), based on some knowledge of their background, to get more work from them. There was little direct benefit to the person from this adaptation, yet the robot stood to gain free labor.

Furthermore, the growing interest in creating robots that are capable of collaborating with other humans in team settings provides an opportunity to explore another side of human emotion, namely, group-based emotions. This paper contributes with the first model on group-based emotions in social robotic partners. We defined a model of group-based emotions for social robots that allowed us to create two distinct robotic characters that express either individual or group-based emotions. This paper also contributes with a user study where two autonomous robots embedded the previous characters, and formed two human-robot teams to play a competitive game. Our results showed that participants perceived the robot that expresses group-based emotions as more likeable and attributed higher levels of group identification and group trust towards their teams, when compared to the robotic partner that expresses individual-based emotions.",,0,0,0,0,0,conferencePaper,2018,"Correia, Filipa; Mascarenhas, Samuel; Prada, Rui; Melo, Francisco S.; Paiva, Ana",Proceedings of the 2018 ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction,978-1-4503-4953-6,,8Q2DHD67,10.1145/3171221.3171252,https://doi.org/10.1145/3171221.3171252,2018-02-26T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T21:19:32Z,2021-02-15T21:19:32Z,2021-02-15T00:00:00Z,261–269,,,,,,,HRI '18,,,,Association for Computing Machinery,"New York, NY, USA",,,,,,ACM Digital Library,,,,,,emotion; trust; group effects; identification; inter-group interactions; self-categorisation; human-robot teamwork,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ACM,group-based emotions in teams of humans and robots,groupbased emotions in teams of humans and robots
,,,,,,,,,,The fugitive: a robot in the wild,"The aim of the movie is to highlight some of the key challenges facing social robots in the wild. The opening scene shows a PR2 leaving a research laboratory venturing into the real world alone in search of meaning. Each subsequent scene in the movie raises important research questions highlighting problems that need to be addressed in the field of social service robotics. When will robots wander around buildings unsupervised? How will they navigate and localize with glass walls: this research problem is exposed when a robot finds itself having to move around a real building. The robot is independent and has a sense of self. It wants to engage in society. It solves this problem by finding a job in a cafe where it is assigned menial tasks, but aspires to be a barista. Thus raising the question of whether PR2 robots are suited to working with hot steaming liquids. Still the robot can dream, why not. The robot realizes in order to progress it needs to learn some new skills and it is shown teaching itself a new skill and practicing to improve its performance. When it is time to put the new skill into practice, the robot has a revelation, discovering in the act of doing that there can be preconditions attached to the enaction of skills, i.e. people do not need peanut butter until they have bread to spread it on. The robot demonstrates his robust understanding of social etiquette by not only offering the peanut butter to the female-human first, but chastising a male-human for not observing this important social protocol. The story ends with the recaptured robot being dragged back to the lab. The robot appears to be mortified by its loss of freedom and looks utterly dejected and dispirited. The robot's behavior generates empathy the human minder, but the robot is pretending to be disheartened, and is deceitfully planning its next escapade as a Jedi Knight!

,,,,,,,,,,Seeing like a rover: team work and human-robot relations,"How do you work with a robot millions of miles away to make scientific discoveries on a planet you've never set foot on? Although much work in human-robot interaction describes the meaningful relationships that humans forge with their robots in one-on-one encounters, when robots venture into places where humans cannot go --- in search and rescue operations, ocean voyages, or even into space --- they do so as part of a large human team. Decisions about what the robot should do and where it should go are therefore the result of large group interactions instead of individual human cognition: the realm of organizational sociology. This talk draws on over a decade of ethnography with NASA's robotic spacecraft missions, specifically focusing on the Mars Exploration Rover mission. Going behind the scenes of the mission, I show the meaning-making, emotional connections, and embodied synergy that scientists develop as they work with their robots millions of miles away on a daily basis. This begins by learning to see through the robots' ""eyes"" on another planet, yet the peculiar social arrangement of mission work produces a deeper connection to the robot explorers too: one that is no doubt responsible for the extraordinary success and unexpected longevity of the mission team. Studying robotic spacecraft teams demonstrates how humans build a particular and peculiar empathy with their robotic colleagues that goes beyond anthropomorphism.

,,,,,,,,,,Interpretation of emotional body language displayed by robots,"In order for robots to be socially accepted and generate empathy they must display emotions. For robots such as Nao, body language is the best medium available, as they do not have the ability to display facial expressions. Displaying emotional body language that can be interpreted whilst interacting with the robot should greatly improve its acceptance. This research investigates the creation of an ""Affect Space"" [1] for the generation of emotional body language that could be displayed by robots. An Affect Space is generated by ""blending"" (i.e. interpolating between) different emotional expressions to create new ones. An Affect Space for body language based on the Circumplex Model of emotions [2] has been created. The experiment reported in this paper investigated the perception of specific key poses from the Affect Space. The results suggest that this Affect Space for body expressions can be used to improve the expressiveness of humanoid robots. In addition, early results of a pilot study are described. It revealed that the context helps human subjects improve their recognition rate during a human-robot imitation game, and in turn this recognition leads to better outcome of the interactions.",,0,0,0,0,0,conferencePaper,2010,"Beck, Aryel; Hiolle, Antoine; Mazel, Alexandre; Cañamero, Lola",Proceedings of the 3rd international workshop on Affective interaction in natural environments,978-1-4503-0170-1,,3I4JIGJK,10.1145/1877826.1877837,https://doi.org/10.1145/1877826.1877837,2010-10-29T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T21:19:32Z,2021-02-15T21:19:32Z,2021-02-15T00:00:00Z,37–42,,,,,,,AFFINE '10,,,,Association for Computing Machinery,"New York, NY, USA",,,,,,ACM Digital Library,,,,,,emotional body language; human robot interactions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ACM,interpretation of emotional body language displayed by robots,interpretation of emotional body language displayed by robots

In this talk we discuss how far Embodied Empathic Agents - whether graphical or robotic - are succeeding; what we can now do, and what open research questions remain.

Such systems track and assess students' knowledge via inferential methods, such as the popular Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) algorithm. However, these methods do not typically draw on the affective signals that human teachers use to assess knowledge, such as indications of discomfort, engagement, or frustration. In this paper we present a novel extension to the BKT model that uses affective data, derived autonomously from video records of children playing an interactive story-telling game with a robot, to infer student knowledge of reading skills. We find that, compared to a control group of children who played the game with only a tablet, children who interacted with an embodied social robot generated stronger affective data signals of engagement and enjoyment during the interaction. We then show that incorporating this affective data into model training improves the quality of the learned knowledge inference models. These results suggest that physically embodied, affect-aware robot tutors can provide more effective and empathic educational experiences for children, and advance both algorithmic and human-centered motivations for further development of systems that tightly integrate affect understanding and complex models of inference with interactive, educational robots.",,0,0,0,0,0,conferencePaper,2016,"Spaulding, Samuel; Gordon, Goren; Breazeal, Cynthia",Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Autonomous Agents & Multiagent Systems,978-1-4503-4239-1,,5P4K95CC,,,2016-05-09T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T21:20:47Z,2021-02-15T21:20:47Z,2021-02-15T00:00:00Z,864–872,,,,,,,AAMAS '16,,,,International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems,"Richland, SC",,,,,,ACM Digital Library,,,,,,affective computing; child-robot interaction; socially assistive robots; educational robots,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ACM,affect-aware student models for robot tutors,affectaware student models for robot tutors

,,,,,,,,,,Face reality: investigating the Uncanny Valley for virtual faces,"The Uncanny Valley (UV) has become a standard term for the theory that near-photorealistic virtual humans often appear unintentionally erie or creepy. This UV theory was first hypothesized by robotics professor Masahiro Mori in the 1970's [Mori 1970] but is still taken seriously today by movie and game developers as it can stop audiences feeling emotionally engaged in their stories or games. It has been speculated that this is due to audiences feeling a lack of empathy towards the characters. With the increase in popularity of interactive drama video games (such as L.A. Noire or Heavy Rain), delivering realistic conversing virtual characters has now become very important in the real-time domain. Video game rendering techniques have advanced to a very high quality; however, most games still use linear blend skinning due to the speed of computation. This causes a mismatch between the realism of the appearance and animation, which can result in an uncanny character. Many game developers opt for a stylised rendering (such as cel-shading) to avoid the uncanny effect [Thompson 2004]. In this preliminary work, we begin to study the complex interaction between rendering style and perceived trust, in order to provide guidelines for developers for creating plausible virtual characters.",,0,0,0,0,0,conferencePaper,2010,"McDonnell, Rachel; Breidt, Martin",ACM SIGGRAPH ASIA 2010 Sketches,978-1-4503-0523-5,,79SDNDSF,10.1145/1899950.1899991,https://doi.org/10.1145/1899950.1899991,2010-12-15T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T21:20:47Z,2021-02-15T21:20:47Z,2021-02-15T00:00:00Z,1–2,,,,,,Face reality,SA '10,,,,Association for Computing Machinery,"New York, NY, USA",,,,,,ACM Digital Library,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ACM,face reality: investigating the uncanny valley for virtual faces,face reality investigating the uncanny valley for virtual faces

While much discussion has developed in academia on their moral and social impact, sex robots have yet to be examined from a critical design perspective and are under-explored in HCI. We use the Story Completion Method(SCM) to explore commonplace assumptions around futures with sex robots and discuss those from a critical design perspective. Thirty five participants completed a story stem of a human encountering a sex robot or vice-versa. Through thematic analysis, we show narratives of consumerist relation-ships between humans and sex robots, stories that describe sex robots as highly-efficient sex workers that (out)perform humans in routinal sex activities, and narratives that explore sex robots as empathetic and sentient beings. Our participant-created stories both reinforce and challenge established norms of sex robots and raise questions that concern responsible design and ethics in HCI. Finally, we show opportunities and limitations of using multiple-perspective story stems in SCM",,0,0,0,0,0,conferencePaper,2020,"Troiano, Giovanni Maria; Wood, Matthew; Harteveld, Casper",Proceedings of the 2020 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,978-1-4503-6708-0,,L47W28NI,10.1145/3313831.3376598,https://doi.org/10.1145/3313831.3376598,2020-04-21T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T21:20:47Z,2021-02-15T21:20:47Z,2021-02-15T00:00:00Z,1–17,,,,,,"""And This, Kids, Is How I Met Your Mother""",CHI '20,,,,Association for Computing Machinery,"New York, NY, USA",,,,,,ACM Digital Library,,,,,,ethics; human-robot interaction; research fiction; sex robots; sexual HCI; speculative design; story completion method,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ACM,"""and this, kids, is how i met your mother"": consumerist, mundane, and uncanny futures with sex robots",and this kids is how i met your mother consumerist mundane and uncanny futures with sex robots

While a number of studies have focused on how human avatars relate to other humans, little attention has been paid to the particularities of human avatar to human avatar interaction. This paper examines characteristic features of such interaction through Cyrafour, a playful embodied identity game in which two human avatars clone various conversations generated elsewhere. Such cloning, or speech shadowing, seems to allow for an empathic embodiment of the meaning transmitted and appears to create a frame for further discussion on the topics raised.

Several recent studies have focused on the chameleon effect, using psychological concepts to investigate human-agent interaction. However, the validity of the chameleon effect in human-agent interaction is controversial. Few studies have explored the influence of individual cognitive ability and the rate of mimicry on the human-agent interaction. We explored the optimal rate of mimicry and the relationship between mimicry rate and individual empathic ability. We controlled the amount of agent mimicry and examined the effect on participants classified as high- and low-perspective takers. We found that, overall, participants preferred agents that mimicked their behavior 83% of the time.

Meanwhile, as in the case of Internet bot, it is still difficult to communiate the emotion described as text, let alone empathizing due to degradation of information online. The current study proposes a method for experiencing emotion on the Internet by reproducing a mechanism of evoking emotion. This method evokes a number of emotions described on the Web, by changing of self-physiological perception with sensory stimuli. To investigate the feasibility of our method, we made a system named ""Communious Mouse.""

We experimented with PD techniques to foster engagement with participants in development of a graphical user interface (GUI) for controlling a robotic system in a smart home environment. The tenet of our approach is that to engage older people in the design of future systems, it is of paramount importance to increment and reinforce knowledge using different techniques and materials, and to create an empathic and trusted relationship between participants and designers. We experimented with different techniques for achieving this, from video-based scenario evaluation to hands-on and gaming activity in which participants had to evaluate the dynamics of a context-dependent interface using an expression-rich modality of interaction. This permitted exploration of experiential elements of design, to reduce the need for the participants to engage in abstract thought and to collect insights on design solutions while having fun together. The entire procedure implied incremental PD cycles in which knowledge was shared and consolidated through a learning process based on doing and playing together.

However, most human facial expression is ambiguous or subtle to recognize resulting in poor accuracy. To overcome this limitation, we propose a peak detection method to select only meaningful images from image sequences which imply significant changes of facial expression by calculating differences between images. We believe this method will alleviate the accuracy degradation caused by different personal appearances and ambiguous facial expressions. When applied to commercial products, it can provides a suitable method for adaptation of the empathetic agent embedded in machines such as personal assistants on TV, smartphone and vehicles based on recognized facial expression of users. For experimental validation of the proposed method, we tested four different features for measuring image similarity with the extended Cohn-Kanade facial image dataset. As a result, we could get better recognition accuracy than the original image sequences.

Differences in participants evaluations were found across the components of empathy as well as individual differences were revealed. Expressions of cognitive empathy (Showing interest, situational understanding) and expressions of empathy of assistance (helping) were perceived positively by participants. However, expressions of affective empathy (expressing own feelings, expressing to know what the other feels) received mainly negative ratings. Cluster analysis revealed individual differences especially for items relating to affective empathy. Whereas one group of participants identified in the cluster analysis rated expressions of affective empathy negatively, a second group of participants rated these expressions positively.

Research approach -- We will extend the capabilities of an existing robotic health buddy with a (DBN based) sensor network. Then we will carry out a series of controlled, long-term field experiments where we identify and evaluate the effects of various agent social communicative behaviours on the user's adoption of health improving lifestyle patterns. Findings/Design -- The findings of the experiments will inform the final design of the health buddy and it's behaviours. We will also realise system adaptivity of the data processing and data fusion methods as well as the health buddy adaptivity to the user's emotional state. Research limitations/Implications -- The project will limit itself to monitoring and motivating people who suffer from cardiovascular chronic conditions and to the home environment. Originality/Value -- The research makes a contribution to the needs of health monitoring for a specific user group.

,,,,,,,,,,Human-centered Multimodal Machine Intelligence,"Multimodal machine intelligence offers enormous possibilities for helping understand the human condition and in creating technologies to support and enhance human experiences [1, 2]. What makes such approaches and systems exciting is the promise they hold for adaptation and personalization in the presence of the rich and vast inherent heterogeneity, variety and diversity within and across people. Multimodal engineering approaches can help analyze human trait (e.g., age), state (e.g., emotion), and behavior dynamics (e.g., interaction synchrony) objectively, and at scale. Machine intelligence could also help detect and analyze deviation in patterns from what is deemed typical. These techniques in turn can assist, facilitate or enhance decision making by humans, and by autonomous systems. Realizing such a promise requires addressing two major lines of, oft intertwined, challenges: creating inclusive technologies that work for everyone while enabling tools that can illuminate the source of variability or difference of interest. This talk will highlight some of these possibilities and opportunities through examples drawn from two specific domains. The first relates to advancing health informatics in behavioral and mental health [3, 4]. With over 10% of the world's population affected, and with clinical research and practice heavily dependent on (relatively scarce) human expertise in diagnosing, managing and treating the condition, engineering opportunities in offering access and tools to support care at scale are immense. For example, in determining whether a child is on the Autism spectrum, a clinician would engage and observe a child in a series of interactive activities, targeting relevant cognitive, communicative and socio- emotional aspects, and codify specific patterns of interest e.g., typicality of vocal intonation, facial expressions, joint attention behavior. Machine intelligence driven processing of speech, language, visual and physiological data, and combining them with other forms of clinical data, enable novel and objective ways of supporting and scaling up these diagnostics. Likewise, multimodal systems can automate the analysis of a psychotherapy session, including computing treatment quality-assurance measures e.g., rating a therapist's expressed empathy. These technology possibilities can go beyond the traditional realm of clinics, directly to patients in their natural settings. For example, remote multimodal sensing of biobehavioral cues can enable new ways for screening and tracking behaviors (e.g., stress in workplace) and progress to treatment (e.g., for depression), and offer just in time support. The second example is drawn from the world of media. Media are created by humans and for humans to tell stories. They cover an amazing range of domains'from the arts and entertainment to news, education and commerce and in staggering volume. Machine intelligence tools can help analyze media and measure their impact on individuals and society. This includes offering objective insights into diversity and inclusion in media representations through robustly characterizing media portrayals from an intersectional perspective along relevant dimensions of inclusion: gender, race, gender, age, ability and other attributes, and in creating tools to support change [5,6]. Again this underscores the twin technology requirements: to perform equally well in characterizing individuals regardless of the dimensions of the variability, and use those inclusive technologies to shine light on and create tools to support diversity and inclusion.",,0,0,0,0,0,conferencePaper,2020,"Narayanan, Shrikanth Shri",Proceedings of the 2020 International Conference on Multimodal Interaction,978-1-4503-7581-8,,JAUXUDRW,10.1145/3382507.3417974,https://doi.org/10.1145/3382507.3417974,2020-10-21T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T21:25:58Z,2021-02-15T21:25:58Z,2021-02-15T00:00:00Z,4–5,,,,,,,ICMI '20,,,,Association for Computing Machinery,"New York, NY, USA",,,,,,ACM Digital Library,,,,,,emotion; behavior; computational psychology; diversity and inclusion; human signals; language; media intelligence; mental health; speech,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ACM,human-centered multimodal machine intelligence,humancentered multimodal machine intelligence

On the other hand, traditional chatbots lack the ability to use emojis effectively for creating an engaging and empathising conversation even after recognising feelings of the conversation partner, an essential communicative skill. This inability is majorly due to the paucity of any such suitable publicly available datasets and framework for training and evaluation of chatbot. Prior work has either classified the emojis or generated empathy dialogue without the use of emojis. Through this work, we propose a new dataset SentEmoji, generated using public dataset EmpathyDialogues, and its mapping to relevant emojis using EmojiNet dataset. We present a novel approach to generate dialogue with emojis to express empathy. A study will be conducted to get user rating on three aspects - empathy/sympathy, relevance and fluency.

However, previous research reveals that users' expectations of what conversational agents can understand and do far outpace their actual technical capabilities. Our work seeks to bridge the gap between these expectations and reality by designing a fun learning experience with several goals: explaining how chatbots work by mapping utterances to a set of intents, teaching strategies for avoiding conversational breakdowns, and increasing desire to use chatbots by creating feelings of empathy toward them. Our experience, called BigBlueBot, consists of interactions with two chatbots in which breakdowns occur and the user (or chatbot) must recover using one or more repair strategies. In a Mechanical Turk evaluation (N=88), participants learned strategies for having successful human-agent interactions, reported feelings of empathy toward the chatbots, and expressed a desire to interact with chatbots in the future.",,0,0,0,0,0,conferencePaper,2019,"Weisz, Justin D.; Jain, Mohit; Joshi, Narendra Nath; Johnson, James; Lange, Ingrid",Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces,978-1-4503-6272-6,,NU77X2W5,10.1145/3301275.3302290,https://doi.org/10.1145/3301275.3302290,2019-03-17T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T21:29:19Z,2021-02-15T21:29:19Z,2021-02-15T00:00:00Z,448–459,,,,,,BigBlueBot,IUI '19,,,,Association for Computing Machinery,"New York, NY, USA",,,,,,ACM Digital Library,,,,,,conversational agents; explainable AI; mechanical turk,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ACM,bigbluebot: teaching strategies for successful human-agent interactions,bigbluebot teaching strategies for successful humanagent interactions

However, because of fear of societal stigma, students may find it more difficult to approach others about the stress they experience. A chatbot can provide an alternative avenue for students to freely share the stressful situations they are experiencing. In this study, we investigated the use of Woebot as a mechanism to help senior high school students alleviate stress from academic workload. 25 participants who engaged in daily conversations with Woebot for a two-week period rated the chatbot’s likeness to a human with a mean score of 5.56 out of 8, while its ability to understand the feelings of the participants and empathize with them had a mean score of 5.61. An analysis of the chat logs showed that the participants valued Woebot’s lessons and stories while they faced challenges in cases when the chatbot generated inappropriate responses.

However, previous emotional chatting models mainly focus on single-turn conversation, and multi-turn context emotional response generation has not been explored. In this paper, we propose an adversarial transfer emotional chatting (ATEC) model for multi-turn conversation which is based on conditional variational autoencoders (CVAE). ATEC has two alternate training phases: supervised training and transfer training. In the supervised training stage, we train the CVAE model, a content discriminator and an emotional classifier based on ground truth corpus. And in the transfer training stage, we change the target emotion and use the content discriminator to force the model to transfer the multi-turn context information, while the emotional classifier regularizes the emotions expressed in the generated responses. Experiments show that the proposed approach achieves state of the art performance with diverse responses and accurate emotional expression.",,0,0,0,0,0,conferencePaper,2019,"Gu, Xiusen; Xu, Weiran; Zhang, Chao",Proceedings of the 2019 3rd International Conference on Innovation in Artificial Intelligence,978-1-4503-6128-6,,8VBCNWPE,10.1145/3319921.3319933,https://doi.org/10.1145/3319921.3319933,2019-03-15T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T21:29:19Z,2021-02-15T21:29:19Z,2021-02-15T00:00:00Z,106–110,,,,,,,ICIAI 2019,,,,Association for Computing Machinery,"New York, NY, USA",,,,,,ACM Digital Library,,,,,,conditional variational autoencoders; emotion transfer; Emotional dialogue system,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ACM,neural emotional response generation via adversarial transfer learning,neural emotional response generation via adversarial transfer learning

Without the timely interaction, the video stops. The system shows guidance information as how to properly react and continue the video playing. The purpose of such a system is to provide indirect experience (of the given video content) by eliciting the user to mimic and empathize with the main character. The user is given the illusion (suspended disbelief) of playing an active role in the unraveling video content. We discuss various features of the newly proposed interactive medium.

However, compared to physical reality, sharing these experiences is difficult because the user's virtual environment is not easily observable from the outside and the user's face is partly occluded by the VR headset. Mixed Reality (MR) is a medium that alleviates some of this disconnect by sharing the virtual context of a VR user in a flat video format that can be consumed by an audience to get a feel for the user's experience.Even though MR allows audiences to connect actions of the VR user with their virtual environment, empathizing with them is difficult because their face is hidden by the headset. We present a solution to address this problem by virtually removing the headset and revealing the face underneath it using a combination of 3D vision, machine learning and graphics techniques.

,,,,,,,,,,Machine Understanding of Emotion and Sentiment,"Emotions are subjective experiences involving perceptual and con-textual factors [4]. There is no objective tool for precise measurement of emotions. However, we can anticipate an emotion's emergence through the knowledge of common responses to events in similar situations. We can also measure proxies of emotions by recognizing emotional expressions [3]. Studying emotional response to multimedia allows identifying expected emotions in users consuming the content. For example,abrupt loud voices are novel and unsettling which result in surprise and higher experience of arousal [2,6]. For a particular type of con-tent such as music, mid-level attributes such as rhythmic stability or melodiousness have strong association with expected emotions[1]. Given that such mid-level attributes are more related to the con-tent, their machine-perception is more straightforward. Moreover,their perception in combination with user models enables building person-specific emotion anticipation models.In addition to studying expected emotions, we can also observe users emotional reactions to understand emotion in multimedia.Typical methods of emotion recognition include recognizing emotions from facial or vocal expressions. Recognition of emotional expressions requires large amount of labeled data, expensive to produce. Hence, the most recent advances in machine-based emotion perception include methods that can leverage unlabeled data through self-supervised and semi-supervised learning [3, 5]. In this talk, I review the field and showcase methods for automatic modeling and recognition of emotions and sentiment indifferent contexts [3,8]. I show how we can identify underlying factors contributing to the construction of subjective experience of emotions [1,7]. Identification of these factors allows us to use them as mid-level attributes to build machine learning models for emotion and sentiment understanding. I also show how emotions and sentiment can be recognized from expressions with the goal of building empathetic autonomous agents [8].",,0,0,0,0,0,conferencePaper,2020,"Soleymani, Mohammad",Companion Publication of the 2020 International Conference on Multimodal Interaction,978-1-4503-8002-7,,ZGQ76ID7,10.1145/3395035.3425321,https://doi.org/10.1145/3395035.3425321,2020-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T21:31:18Z,2021-02-15T21:31:18Z,,206–207,,,,,,,ICMI '20 Companion,,,,Association for Computing Machinery,"New York, NY, USA",,,,,,,,"event-place: Virtual Event, Netherlands",,,machine learning; emotion; affective computing; sentiment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ACM,machine understanding of emotion and sentiment,machine understanding of emotion and sentiment

VRNF promises nonfiction content producers the potential to create new ways for audiences to experience ""the real""; allowing viewers to transition from passive spectators to active participants. Our current project is exploring VRNF through a series of ethnographic and experimental studies. In order to document the content available, we embarked on an analysis of VR documentaries produced to date.

This is especially concerning, given that computer science-related jobs are projected to grow 12% in the next six years. One contributing factor is that media representations of computer science can lead underrepresented groups to perceive themselves as unfit for the discipline, and ultimately to drop out. To address this concern, I propose an empathetic IDE model that uses affective computing technologies to promote empathy among computer science students. A quasi-experimental research design will be used to evaluate the model's effectiveness in fostering a supportive community between instructors and students. By leveraging emotional learning process data as a form of constant feedback to both instructors and students, this research can gain new insights into how to improve learning environments for computer science students with or without affective computing technologies.",,0,0,0,0,0,conferencePaper,2017,"De Lira, Carla",Proceedings of the 2017 ACM Conference on International Computing Education Research,978-1-4503-4968-0,,WH3LS7JJ,10.1145/3105726.3105742,https://doi.org/10.1145/3105726.3105742,2017-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T21:31:18Z,2021-02-15T21:31:18Z,,293–294,,,,,,,ICER '17,,,,Association for Computing Machinery,"New York, NY, USA",,,,,,,,"event-place: Tacoma, Washington, USA",,,affective computing; computer science education; empathy in computer science; learning analytics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ACM,improving the learning experiences of first-year computer science students with empathetic ides,improving the learning experiences of firstyear computer science students with empathetic ides

,,,,,,,,,,Reaching Cooperation Using Emerging Empathy and Counter-Empathy,"According to social neuropsychology, the cooperative behavior is largely influenced by empathy, which is deemed essential of emotional system and has wide impact on social interaction. In the work reported here, we believe that the emergence of empathy and counter-empathy is closely related to creatures' inertial impression on intragroup coexistence and competition. Based on this assumption, we establish a unified model of empathy and counter-empathy in light of Hebb's rule. We also present Adaptive Empathetic Learner (AEL), a training method for agents to enable affective utility evaluation and learning procedure in multi-agent system. In AEL, the empathy model is integrated into the adversarial bandit setting in order to achieve a high degree of versatility. Our algorithm is first verified in the survival game, which is designed to simulate the primitive hunting environment. In this game, empathy and cooperation emerge among agents with different power. In another test about Iterated Prisoners' Dilemma, cooperation was reached even between an AEL agent and a rational one. Moreover, when confronted with hostile, the AEL agent showed sufficient goodwill and vigilantly protected its safe payoffs. In the Ultimatum Game, it's worth mentioning that absolute fairness could be achieved on account of the self-adaptation of empathy and counter-empathy.",,0,0,0,0,0,conferencePaper,2019,"Chen, Jize; Wang, Changhong",Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and MultiAgent Systems,978-1-4503-6309-9,,6UX4K5HK,,,2019-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T21:31:18Z,2021-02-15T21:31:18Z,,746–753,,,,,,,AAMAS '19,,,,International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems,"Richland, SC",,,,,,,,"event-place: Montreal QC, Canada",,,cooperation; adversarial bandit; empathy and counter-empathy; multi-agent system,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ACM,reaching cooperation using emerging empathy and counter-empathy,reaching cooperation using emerging empathy and counterempathy

Moreover, the ability to write in a scholarly manner is a core competence, often taking the form of discourse with oneself and the literature. Computational linguistics research has developed a rich array of tools for machine interpretation of human discourse, but work to develop these tools in the context of learning is at a relatively early stage. Moreover, there is a significant difference between designing tools to assist researchers in discourse analysis, and their deployment on platforms to provide meaningful analytics for the learners and educators who are conducting that discourse.

(see Rubin, Bailenson). This essay will analyze women of color's labor as virtual reality's documentary subjects whose digital presence and hospitality within war-torn, emiserated, and inhospitable scenes such as a Lebanese refugee camp, a favela, and a cucumber farm enables a fantasy of virtuous empathy on the part of the viewer. Virtual reality's painstakingly created virtuous identity as the ""empathy machine"" satisfies desires for prosocial feelings of compassion, empathy, and identification that replace encounters with politics, unwelcome bodies, and protest.

Compounding this problem, there is a lack of robust, easily adoptable educational accessibility material available to instructors for inclusion in their curricula. To address these issues, we have created five Accessibility Learning Labs (ALL) using an experiential learning structure. The labs are designed to educate and create awareness of accessibility needs in computing. The labs enable easy classroom integration by providing instructors with complete educational materials including lecture slides, activities, and quizzes. The labs are hosted on our servers and require only a browser to be utilized.To demonstrate the benefit of our material and the potential benefits of our experiential lab format with empathy-creating material, we conducted a study involving 276 students in ten sections of an introductory computing course. Our findings include: (I) The demonstrated potential of the proposed experiential learning format and labs are effective in motivating and educating students about the importance of accessibility (II) The labs are effective in informing students about foundational accessibility topics (III) Empathy-creating material is demonstrated to be a beneficial component in computing accessibility education, supporting students in placing a higher value on the importance of creating accessible software.

,,,,,,,,,,Mapping Empathy in the Computer Science Classroom,"Empathy is a humanistic skill, a capacity that allows us to perceive other people's emotions, putting ourselves under their perspective [1]. The study of empathy is highlighted as a tool to provide a better understanding of people's thoughts, feelings and how they affect behavior [2]. Being aware of that, a design company created the Empathy Map (EM), which is usually employed in the initial phase of the Design Thinking process to understand user's concerns, feelings and aspirations [3].Teaching practices known as student-centered, inherited from the constructivist school, are not new [4]. Several educators have applied these approaches inside the Computer Science (CS) classroom [5]. A key to success in CS education is the construction of the computational thinking [5]. Learning to program is not an easy task and the process is surrounded by several emotional reactions such as frustration, anxiety, happiness and others [6]. In this sense, EMs can be useful to capture student's feelings, guiding educators strategies during CS classes.Here, I describe the experience of using the EM inside the Computer Science classroom at the University Center Barão de Mauá. The process of building EMs involves the description of the persona, who, in this case, are the students of a given year in the CS course. In the center of EM, the picture of a student is drawn and the surrounding region is divided into 4 areas [3, 7]: 1) THINK and FEEL - What are the students thinking/feeling? 2) HEAR and SEE - What are the students hearing/seeing? 3) SAY and DO - What are the students saying/doing? 4) PAIN/CHALLENGES and GAINS - What are the challenges the students are facing? Is there anything painful to do? How do they measure success?The EM was performed in two different stages of the CS course: in the first and third years. The students were asked to build the EM, representing their feelings and aspirations about CS. The EM of the first year showed: 1) THINK and FEEL - ""thinking about the future"", ""feeling fear"", ""curiosity"", ""insecurity"", ""confusion"". 2) HEAR and SEE - "" hearing positive statements from family and friends"", ""seeing themselves in a trainee program"", ""working or doing a master's degree"", ""developing themselves"". They also reported to hear that CS is very difficult. 3) SAY and DO - They say learning is difficult, They do study and work; 4) PAIN/CHALLENGES - they report feeling insecure about finishing the course and find a position. The main challenge is to conciliate both working and studies. The students of the third year reported: 1) THINK and FEEL - ""thinking about the future"", ""feeling anxiety"", ""anger"", ""tiredness"", ""worry""; 2) HEAR and SEE - "" they hear that CS is a promising career"", ""see opportunities and/or lack of them"". They reported hear questions about what they will do in the future; 3) SAY and DO - ""procrastinating and working""; 4) PAIN/CHALLENGES - The pain reported refers to the anxiety of completing the course and the excessive procrastination. The main challenge reported was to set medium/short term goals as study to complete tasks in the CS course.As a conclusion, we highlight that the first year students were more motivated about their future, whereas the third year are tired and anxious about finishing the course. The EM construction was able to show student's feelings and pains about the course, allowing the educator to capture the student's perspectives. Based on that, it may be possible to conduct a more appropriate learning plan to manage how emotional aspects can influence the learning process. As a future work, EM will be used along with specific subjects in a qualitative study, considering subjects with highest failure rates in CS curriculum.",,0,0,0,0,0,conferencePaper,2020,"de Oliveira, Lariza Laura",Proceedings of the 2020 ACM Conference on International Computing Education Research,978-1-4503-7092-9,,E45AXW5J,10.1145/3372782.3408109,https://doi.org/10.1145/3372782.3408109,2020-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T21:31:19Z,2021-02-15T21:31:19Z,,303,,,,,,,ICER '20,,,,Association for Computing Machinery,"New York, NY, USA",,,,,,,,"event-place: Virtual Event, New Zealand",,,computer science education; empathy map,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ACM,mapping empathy in the computer science classroom,mapping empathy in the computer science classroom

The aim was to evoke curiosity and empathy towards someone living elsewhere or under different socio-economic circumstances. In addition, we strived to apply design ethics (e.g. protecting users from insults, humiliation, inappropriate content etc) and take users' privacy into account. By setting up these boundaries for this user group we found ourselves confronted with a set of conflicting design decisions which ultimately led to a lesser and different user experience than we had expected. Here, we discuss the interplay between our design decisions and the consequences thereof, and evaluate the mistakes we made.

These systems are mainly used by universities as well as by commercial training centres. We analysed several popular e-learning platforms used in Polish universities and find them very unfriendly for the users. For this reason, the authors began the work on the creation of a new system that would be not only useful, but also usable for students, teachers and system administrators. This paper presents a case study of e-learning platform design process. We applied Design Thinking (DT) approach which puts a strong emphasis on the participation of end-users throughout the design process. Such an approach makes final product more user-friendly and better suited to end-users needs. An interdisciplinary team of designers implemented the design process in five stages: Empathizing - a thorough analysis of the problem and its context; Defining - synthesis of information obtained in the previous step and identifying user needs and insights; Ideating - generating solutions; Prototyping and Testing solutions proposed in the Ideating phase. During the design process the team used many additional methods, such as Empathy map, Stakeholders map, Value preposition canvas, personas, brainstorming, Card sorting and many more. As the result of design process we obtain an interactive prototype of designed e-learning platform. The prototype was tested by end-users and the feedback from the testers was collected. It confirmed that the use of the DT approach in design process allows to better fit designed product to the users' needs.

,,,,,,,,,,The World of Freedom,"Indeed, people spend more time on deep thinking since 2020. The questions which ask mainly by the sociologists, now become the topics on the dining table. The debates on social and moral dilemmas are happening intensively 24 hours on the internet. We started to think more about who we are, where we are going, and how we will value the information we have received. Do we have freedom? Shall we believe absolute freedom? Sometimes people directly transform the idea of liberty into democracy. However, shall we also equal freedom to democracy? Since we are all inside this one pandemic bubble, after most people stay at home for a couple of months, we start emerging a global-size collective memory, which makes people more empathetically understand others' situations. Meanwhile, more and more people have to learn and take experience virtually. The attention of empathy and the new work-from-home mode evokes the initial idea of this virtual reality experience. We start to ask how people could learn and think more effectively in this brand new virtual age? Unity program makes this innovation possible. The innovative architecture modeling could permit a large group of people to experience personal space and sharing areas simultaneously. The sound design is specially designed for the various space sound and the audience's interactivities. We use this program to build up an immersive and empathetic space that embodies a hypothetical argument of a social dilemma into a virtual manifestation.

,,,,,,,,,,Towards a Pattern Language for Hybrid Education,"In this paper we offer an initial framework for a pattern language of hybrid education. With the term hybrid education, we imply the use of educational design patterns that actively strive to cut across, circumventing or upheave traditional dichotomies within education such as physical-digital, academic-nonacademic, online-offline, formal-informal, learning-teaching and individual-collective. In doing so, hybrid education invites uncertainty, open-endedness, risk-taking, experimentation, critical creativity, disruption, dialogue and democracy (back) into the heart of education. Accordingly we see, within hybrid education, the promise to push against and circumvent current trends of marketization, managerialism and standardization in higher education today. Here, a pattern language for hybrid education presents an alternative way of designing for future higher education in ways that are not focused on teaching to the test, playing it safe, rankings or gaming the system approaches. Rather, hybrid education focuses on open-endedness, risk-taking, relational entanglements, experimentation, exploration and empathy. In this way, designing for hybrid education is in this paper achieved, partly by taking a decidedly value-based and vision-driven approach to learning design patterns based on philosophy in higher education and critical pedagogy, partly by working together in hybrid ways and across disciplines and domains in order to open up both the field of teaching and learning in higher education as well as the field of learning design and design patterns. The result is the almost 80 design patterns for hybrid education. The paper presents the pattern categories for hybrid education, the different design patterns contained in these. Furthermore, the pattern mining ground and workshop process, the outcome of the value workshop and the vision workshop as well as three example scenarios is described in order to show both the underlying value and vision foundation for the pattern language as well as how it plays out in concrete scenarios.",,0,0,0,0,0,conferencePaper,2017,"Köppe, Christian; Nørgård, Rikke Toft; Pedersen, Alex Young",Proceedings of the VikingPLoP 2017 Conference on Pattern Languages of Program,978-1-4503-6342-6,,HB4JJ3PR,10.1145/3158491.3158504,https://doi.org/10.1145/3158491.3158504,2017-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T21:31:59Z,2021-02-15T21:31:59Z,,,,,,,,,VikingPLoP '17,,,,Association for Computing Machinery,"New York, NY, USA",,,,,,,,"event-place: Grube, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany",,,education; educational patterns; hybrid pedagogy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ACM,towards a pattern language for hybrid education,towards a pattern language for hybrid education

We present findings from literature together with our own observations to determine if there are distinguishing characteristics for Deaf children that may influence design sessions with them. We found that Deaf children generally have reduced literacy and slower academic progress, reduced social and emotional development, reduced empathy and a level of nervousness in novel situations, delayed language development, and limited or delayed spoken language. We also found that Deaf children are active and innovative in approaching communication, have sensitive visual attention in their peripheral vision, enhanced attention to small visual changes, and a capacity for visual learning. Finally, cultural issues within the Deaf community mean that Deaf children should be free to interact on their own terms in a design situation.

Designing technologies to support inclusive play are understudied in Human-Computer Interaction. We synthesized literature, conducted design ethnography in an inclusive classroom, and interviewed and surveyed parents and teachers to explore this problem. Our research contributes an empirical understanding of the current state of inclusive play and a characterization of the design space for interactive technologies that can support children and adults with inclusive play. We identify key facilitators of inclusive play: direct and embedded supports, transparency, adjustability, emphasis on children's interests and strengths, and current technology use. We also describe significant barriers to inclusive play: effort required to facilitate inclusive play, children's preferences, parental inexperience, and inappropriate technology. Through our discussion, we conclude that interactive technologies should be designed to harness the facilitators and help overcome the barriers in order to maximize children's opportunities with inclusive play.",,0,0,0,0,0,conferencePaper,2015,"Sobel, Kiley; O'Leary, Katie; Kientz, Julie A.",Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Interaction Design and Children,978-1-4503-3590-4,,X2GRM27H,10.1145/2771839.2771844,https://doi.org/10.1145/2771839.2771844,2015-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T21:31:59Z,2021-02-15T21:31:59Z,,39–48,,,,,,,IDC '15,,,,Association for Computing Machinery,"New York, NY, USA",,,,,,,,"event-place: Boston, Massachusetts",,,children; human-centered design; assistive technology; inclusion; inclusive design; inclusive play; universal design,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ACM,maximizing children's opportunities with inclusive play: considerations for interactive technology design,maximizing childrens opportunities with inclusive play considerations for interactive technology design

While there has been much focus on understanding the efficacy of these systems as interventions to reduce racial bias, there has been less attention paid to how individuals’ prior physical-world racial attitudes influence their experiences of such games about racial issues. Toward addressing this gap, the study presented here examines the relationships between PreK-12 educators’ colorblind racial attitudes and their game experience and narrative interpretations in narrative videogame modeling racial and ethnic socialization called Passage Home. Passage Home embeds a novel computational model and simulation informed by the Racial Encounter Coping Appraisal and Socialization Theory (RECAST) [3] to simulate a discriminatory racial encounter in a classroom setting. The system serves as a tool for assessing players’ racial and ethnic socialization (RES) experiences to support interventions for learning about racial bias. This paper presents the results of a user study deploying Passage Home with PreK-12 educators. Analysis revealed that players’ colorblind racial attitudes and ethnic identity were related to their in-game racial appraisal and feelings of competence, negative affect, and empathy in the game. Given the prevalence of colorblind racial ideology across racial and ethnic groups in the United States [4, 5], we propose an initial typology of players’ colorblind racial attitudes emerging from this analysis to aid in the future development of serious game interventions addressing racial discrimination.",,0,0,0,0,0,conferencePaper,2020,"Olson, Danielle Marie; Harrell, D.

,,,,,,,,,,A Study on the Use of Multiple Avatars in 3D Sign Language Dictionaries,"Numerous platforms in the field of machine translation of oralized languages to sign language are available nowadays, and accessibility has been gaining more and more space. However, it is noticed that most platforms use only a unique 3D avatar, and this character is responsible for all the reproduction of signals, with no alternative of choice for users. Such a limitation may have an impact on the acceptance of automatic translation by the deaf community, since there must be empathy of the deaf with the animated agent. Having only one available avatar makes impossible a more precise choice, which may involve personal characteristics and affinities. One of the reasons for this is the great effort, human and technological, that is necessary for the construction of a sign dictionary, which can scale proportionally with the addition of new avatars. In view of such a scenario, the present study aims to investigate mechanisms that allow multiple avatars to be offered in sign dictionaries without necessarily needing to reshape them again and manually, one by one. The initial premise is to analyze the functioning of each signal in a particular avatar, in order to predict possible problems in the reproduction of the signals after the permutation to a new one (retargeting), such as improper collisions or mesh invasions. As main contributions of the work, techniques are proposed to facilitate the identification and automatic correction of nonconformities in the movement of the signals and also some practical recommendations for the modeling of new avatars in order to minimize the occurrence of errors.",,0,0,0,0,0,conferencePaper,2017,"Vieira, Suanny; Santos, Alexandre; Costa, Rostand; Maritan, Tiago; Aschoff, Manuella; Veríssimo, Vinícius",Proceedings of the 23rd Brazillian Symposium on Multimedia and the Web,978-1-4503-5096-9,,2RUCF9G4,10.1145/3126858.3126865,https://doi.org/10.1145/3126858.3126865,2017-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T21:31:59Z,2021-02-15T21:31:59Z,,325–332,,,,,,,WebMedia '17,,,,Association for Computing Machinery,"New York, NY, USA",,,,,,,,"event-place: Gramado, RS, Brazil",,,accessibility; avatar; machine translation; retargeting; sign language,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ACM,a study on the use of multiple avatars in 3d sign language dictionaries,a study on the use of multiple avatars in 3d sign language dictionaries

During the last decade, research and practical interest for non-technicalities has grown, revealing the building blocks to be various skills and abilities beside pure technical knowledge. Multiple attempts to categorise these blocks have been made, but so far little international studies have been performed that identify skills by asking experts from both the industrial and academic world: which abilities are needed for a developer to excel in the software engineering industry? To answer this question, we performed a Delphi study, inviting 36 experts from 11 different countries world-wide, affiliated with 21 internationally renowned institutions. This study presents the 55 identified and ranked skills as classified in four major areas: communicative skills (empathy, actively listening, etc.), collaborative skills (sharing responsibility, learning from each other, etc.), problem solving skills (verifying assumptions, solution-oriented thinking, etc.), and personal skills (curiosity, being open to ideas, etc.), of which a comparison has been made between opinions of technical experts, business experts, and academics.

,,,,,,,,,,Evolution of Human Mind and Culture Viewed from the Study of Chimpanzees,"I have studied chimpanzees both in the wild and in the laboratory. My talk illustrates the evolutionary origins of human mind and culture. The human mother–infant relationship is characterized by physical separation, and the stable supine posture of infants; enabling face-to-face communication via facial expressions, vocal exchange, and manual gestures, and also demonstration of object manipulation. I have used the novel ""participant observation"" method in the laboratory and through ""field experiments"" in their natural habitat. There are several critical differences between the two species: chimpanzees lack the social referencing ability observed in human children and chimpanzees seldom engage in active teaching. Moreover, although young chimpanzees showed unique working memory capacity, often superior to that of human adults, they are less able to learning symbols. In sum, mind and culture in humans is fundamentally influenced by the manner of raising young children; characterized by collaboration among multiple adults. This aspect of human rearing may be linked to the development of empathy, altruistic behavior, reciprocity, understanding others? minds, and so on.

With all the attention and publicity surrounding CS for All and increased support from a variety of corners over the ensuing year, it is easy to become complacent and start believing that we have ""arrived"". During her 2016 SIGCSE keynote, Jan Cuny talked about catching the wave and using it to our advantage. This talk will focus on where we go from here. We caught the wave; now what do we do to ensure that we don't get swallowed by it? What lessons can be learned from an election that featured the likes of fake news, Wiki leaks, rogue email servers, runaway tweets and showed in stark relief the divides that exist in our country. Computer science represents one of those divides. Given this and the fact that addressing the educational inequities prevalent in computer science was front and center in the CS for All announcement, what better time is there to renew our commitment to broadening participation in computing? As educators we have a powerful opportunity and responsibility in the wake of the blowback from the election-to educate, to listen, to remind ourselves constantly that we live in a very diverse country. We have no shortage of innovation in computer science, but who are we inspiring, what impact are those innovations having, and what can we do to learn from the lessons of the past to improve CS education?

We examined the extent to which technical skills and empathy are relevant to and appreciated by different types of users, and whether differences in infomediaries are evident across different types of PAVs. We asked whether particular infomediary behaviours were associated with outcome differences as reported by PAV users. We learned that infomediaries provide the human face for the information age by taking on the functions of facilitation, coaching, referral and teaching, and by assuming the role of a trusted gatekeeper. The process of infomediation turned out to be of prominence, within which the infomediary is a key component.

Investigating an Approach for Automatic Generation of Personas Based on Questionnaires and Clustering,"Personas are fictional representations of an end user based on data collected from a specific target audience. The creation of personas takes time, because part of the process is manual, which causes difficulties during the stages of data generation and analysis, if the data sample is large. The present work aims to investigate the results of the automatic generation of personas through a questionnaire and the Clustering method. Initially, a questionnaire was applied in order to outline the profile of students in the Computer Science and Software Engineering courses at the university Federal of Ceará. 130 responses were obtained from this applied questionnaire. The automatic generation of personas used the collected responses as a database, these data were applied to the Clustering method. From Clustering, using a specific tool for this purpose, it was possible to generate four personas automatically. In relation to the data generated from the personas, it was possible to identify some characteristics, such as: (a) course choice factor: the opportunity to work with new technologies, influence of family and friends and the possibility of living abroad; (b) factor of withdrawal from the course: lack of identification with the course, learning difficulties in the disciplines and finance; and, (c) area of interest: software engineering, human-computer interaction and computer graphics. A new questionnaire was applied in order to validate the personas generated in relation to credibility, empathy and similarity. Based on the results obtained, it was observed that two of the four personas generated achieved greater prominence in relation to the validation criteria, showing that the personas look like real people, students think like the personas and share similar interests.",,0,0,0,0,0,conferencePaper,2020,"Branco, Karina da S.

Virtual characters are well established within the film, game and research worlds, yet much remains to be learned about which design, stylistic or behavioural factors combine to make a believable character. The definition of believability depends on context. When designing and implementing characters for entertainment, the concern is making believable characters that the audience will engage with. When using virtual characters in experiments, the aim is to create characters and synthetic spaces that people respond to in a similar manner to their real world counterparts. Research has shown that users show empathy for virtual characters. However, uncanny valley effects – ie dips in user impressions – can arise: behavioural fidelity expectations increase alongside increases in visual fidelity and vice versa. Often, characters used within virtual environments tend to be of fairly low fidelity due to technological constraints including rendering in real-time (Garau et al. 2003). This problem is addressed here by using non-linear playback and compositing of pre-rendered high fidelity sequences.",,0,0,0,0,0,conferencePaper,2010,"Rivera, Fiona; Watten, Phil; Holroyd, Patrick; Beacher, Felix; Mania, Katerina; Critchley, Hugo",ACM SIGGRAPH 2010 Posters,978-1-4503-0393-4,,PLWX2ZB5,10.1145/1836845.1836862,https://doi.org/10.1145/1836845.1836862,2010-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T21:32:00Z,2021-02-15T21:32:00Z,,,,,,,,,SIGGRAPH '10,,,,Association for Computing Machinery,"New York, NY, USA",,,,,,,,"event-place: Los Angeles, California",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ACM,real-time compositing framework for interactive stereo fmri displays,realtime compositing framework for interactive stereo fmri displays

Virtually, all programmers are potential users of third-party APIs. From the perspective of the theory of Semiotic Engineering, we may characterize an API as an artifact mediating the communication between two types of developers: the API designers and its users. During the construction of an API, the designers should establish proper dialogues with the users. These dialogues will enable the conversation of these actors at the interaction time. In this way, we define a conversational API as an API capable of offering effective dialogues to its users. In this paper, we introduce Colloquy, a method for supporting the design of conversational APIs. Colloquy results from the lessons learnt during an action research conducted for redesigning a real and complex API. The set of Colloquy resources allow API designers to go beyond conventional concerns with usability. We also report in this paper a case study in which Colloquy was used for redesigning a refactoring API. The study findings indicate the method helped the designer creating empathy with the API users, as well as better reflecting and depicting the requirements and the conversations that the API should attend to the different user profiles.",,0,0,0,0,0,conferencePaper,2020,"Bastos, João Antonio D.

,,,,,,,,,,Of Kittens and Kiddies: Reflections on Participatory Design with Small Animals and Small Humans,"Participatory Design strives to broaden the perspective of and increase empathy in design by giving specific and often under represented user groups, such as children or older people, a voice in the design process. The exact nature of the role played by such participants in the design process (e.g. user, informant, co-designer) and how much voice they are actually given has been the subject of a long and heated debate in the participatory design community. The emerging field of Animal Computer Interaction, which seeks to empower animals through user-centered technology, offers an interesting opportunity for a comparative analysis. Indeed, working with animals poses many of the challenges also posed by working with children, due to similarities with regards to cognitive capabilities or attention span at particular developmental stages, and with regards to the designer's ability to communicate with them. This workshop aims to bring together researchers from the fields of animal and child computer interaction to explore similarities and difference in the challenges they face, the methods they use and the lessons they have learnt, to date, with the objective of gaining a better understanding of these important aspects and setting an agenda for further collaboration and study between the two communities.",,0,0,0,0,0,conferencePaper,2016,"Chisik, Yoram; Mancini, Clara","Proceedings of the 14th Participatory Design Conference: Short Papers, Interactive Exhibitions, Workshops - Volume 2",978-1-4503-4136-3,,U2ZKL2B4,10.1145/2948076.2948093,https://doi.org/10.1145/2948076.2948093,2016-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T21:32:00Z,2021-02-15T21:32:00Z,,123–124,,,,,,,PDC '16,,,,Association for Computing Machinery,"New York, NY, USA",,,,,,,,"event-place: Aarhus, Denmark",,,children; participatory design; ACI; animal computer interaction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ACM,of kittens and kiddies: reflections on participatory design with small animals and small humans,of kittens and kiddies reflections on participatory design with small animals and small humans
,,,,,,,,,,A Sensing Architecture for Empathetic Data Systems,"Today's increasingly large and complex databases require novel and machine aided ways of exploring data. To optimize the selection and presentation of data, we suggest an unconventional approach. Instead of exclusively relying on explicit user input to specify relevant information or to navigate through a data space, we exploit the power and potential of the users' unconscious processes in addition. To this end, the user is immersed in a mixed reality environment while his bodily reactions are captured using unobtrusive wearable devices. The users' reactions are analyzed in real-time and mapped onto higher-level psychological states, such as surprise or boredom, in order to trigger appropriate system responses that direct the users' attention to areas of potential interest in the visualizations. The realization of such a close experience-based human-machine loop raises a number of technical challenges, such as the real-time interpretation of psychological user states.

The system acts as a transducer of rhythmic input into multimodal output, and was designed to investigate the affordances of this embodied learning approach on the early literacy skills acquisition of children. The project follows a design thinking process (empathize, define, ideate, prototype, test) to explore cultural systems as a grounding for learning technologies design. The session provides a space to think beyond the traditional keypad interface and its reliance on alphabetic input, to explore how the application of the talking drum cultural system in the domain of human-computer interaction can be used to transform children's early experiences with literacy. I will demonstrate creating sequences of letters and words using the system by playing drum tones of varying pitches (tone, slap and bass).",,0,0,0,0,0,conferencePaper,2019,"Tchetgen, Pierre-Valery Njenji",Proceedings of the 2019 on Creativity and Cognition,978-1-4503-5917-7,,8TX7WJGS,10.1145/3325480.3326544,https://doi.org/10.1145/3325480.3326544,2019-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T21:33:24Z,2021-02-15T21:33:24Z,,513–517,,,,,,,C&amp;C '19,,,,Association for Computing Machinery,"New York, NY, USA",,,,,,,,"event-place: San Diego, CA, USA",,,embodied learning; culturally-grounded pedagogies and technologies; drum language; haptic devices; interaction paradigm; literacy development,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ACM,drumball: multimodal meaning production through digital drum talk,drumball multimodal meaning production through digital drum talk
,,,,,,,,,,Towards Automated Emotional Conversation Generation with Implicit and Explicit Affective Strategy,"Building an empathic conversation machine in open-domain is a promising research topic in natural language processing. However, most current approaches rely on designated emotions to conduct generating responses and lack the ability to decide the appropriate emotion strategy. In this paper, we propose a dialogue model of jointly predicting and generating emotions called DRCVAE, which stands for Decoupled Representations of Conditional Variational Autoencoders.More specifically, the model separates the latent variable in conditional variational autoencoders (CVAE) into two parts: emotion and content. Then the latent emotional strategy (implicit) is further forced to predict the target emotion probability distribution (explicit). By using implicit and explicit emotional strategy, a newly designed paired decoder incorporates rich control information to decode the response. Experiment results demonstrate that DRCVAE provides an effective way to infer target emotions and generate high-quality responses simultaneously.",,0,0,0,0,0,conferencePaper,2019,"Gu, Xiusen; Xu, Weiran; Li, Si",Proceedings of the 2019 International Symposium on Signal Processing Systems,978-1-4503-6241-2,,7S2N4L7P,10.1145/3364908.3365288,https://doi.org/10.1145/3364908.3365288,2019-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T21:33:24Z,2021-02-15T21:33:24Z,,125–130,,,,,,,SSPS 2019,,,,Association for Computing Machinery,"New York, NY, USA",,,,,,,,"event-place: Beijing, China",,,Emotional dialogue system; CVAE; decoupled representations; paired decoder,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ACM,towards automated emotional conversation generation with implicit and explicit affective strategy,towards automated emotional conversation generation with implicit and explicit affective strategy
,,,,,,,,,,Tracing Situated Effects of Innovative Design Methods: Inexperienced Designers' Practices,"In recent years the design research community has been active in developing new methods for user involvement and collaboration in the design process. The new methods, often called innovative design methods, correspond more to designer's genuine ways of thinking and working than do traditional user-centered ones. The entire purpose of innovative method is to allow for designer's creativity in the design of method and reflective learning, instead of relying on predefined rules of method. For this reason, codification and scientific evaluation are often regarded very challenging, if meaningful at all. This leads us to raise a question; what could be relevant ways of framing and communicating innovative design methods to better capture their nature and value?As one attempt to explore this question, our study takes a close look at inexperienced designers' practices with innovative methods, such as probes or co-design workshops. We chose students as research subjects because their situated actions – and the challenges they face in understanding and applying these methods – reveal just kind of knowledge about the innovative methods that needs to be communicated. To do this, we analyzed students' learning diaries written during the design course. When the students reported uncertainties and disappointments due to 'ill-defined' nature of such methods, we were able to trace the reasons for disappointments. We also found that the innovative design methods in fact supported the students for empathic learning and design inspiration from the making process of the methods.",,0,0,0,0,0,conferencePaper,2011,"Lee, Jung-Joo; Vaajakallio, Kirsikka; Mattelmäki, Tuuli",Procedings of the Second Conference on Creativity and Innovation in Design,978-1-4503-0754-3,,R5RRH8P2,10.1145/2079216.2079231,https://doi.org/10.1145/2079216.2079231,2011-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T21:33:24Z,2021-02-15T21:33:24Z,,103–113,,,,,,,DESIRE '11,,,,Association for Computing Machinery,"New York, NY, USA",,,,,,,,"event-place: Eindhoven, Netherlands",,,empathic design; co-design; design education; innovative design methods,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ACM,tracing situated effects of innovative design methods: inexperienced designers' practices,tracing situated effects of innovative design methods inexperienced designers practices

,,,,,,,,,,Challenging Social Exclusion in Computing via 'Theatre of the Oppressed' Pedagogy,"Micro-aggressions, hostile climates, and intersectional discrimination contribute to students feeling excluded from fully participating in Computer Science or other STEM programs. To address this exclusion, students need to empathize with each other, and for that we need them to be having frank, open conversations about difficult situations. This is hard to achieve, as people do not typically want to talk about difficult situations with strangers. Computer Science faculty may shy away from these difficult conversations, as they may feel they lack the expertise to address social issues effectively. To address this issue, we have been conducting 'Exclusion Response Workshops' based on the 'Theatre of the Oppressed' methodology of rehearsing social change. This involves students anonymously contributing scenarios of micro-aggressions they have experienced or witnessed and then roleplaying alternate outcomes. These workshops create an empathetic environment for frank and open discussion of difficult issues. We have been scaling this effort by conducting workshops with all freshmen and transfer students in our College of Computing and Informatics. In this SIGCSE workshop, attendees will participate in an Exclusion Response Workshop, then have an open discussion about the workshop experience, workshop logistics, and pros and cons of running this workshop as a mandatory class activity versus a voluntary activity. Participants will learn about the workshop structure, and the Theatre of the Oppressed methodology.

,,,,,,,,,,Socially-Sensitive Interfaces: From Offline Studies to Interactive Experiences,"Recent years have initiated a paradigm shift from pure taskbased human-machine interfaces towards socially-sensitive interaction. In addition to what users explicitly say or gesture at, socially-sensitive interfaces are able to sense more subtle human cues, such as head postures and movements, to infer psychological user states, such as attention and affect, and also to enrich system responses with social signals. However, most approaches focus on offline analysis of previously recorded data limiting the investigation to prototypical behaviors in laboratory-like settings. In my presentation, I will focus on challenges that arise when integrating social signal processing techniques into interactive systems designed for real-world applications. From a technical perspective, this requires effective tools able to synchronize, process, and analyze relevant signals in online mode. From a user perspective, appropriate strategies need to be defined to respond to social signals at the right moment in time without disturbing the flow of interaction. I will discuss two interaction styles for socially-sensitive interfaces. In the area of information retrieval, the concept of empathic stimulation has been used to optimize the selection and presentation of data. The basic idea is to exploit sensory data on the users' emotional state to provide them with cues that inspire their curiosity during the data exploration task. In the domain of social coaching, the concept of social augmentation has been employed to give people ambient feedback on their behavior while being engaged in a social interaction. The presentation will be illustrated by examples from various national and international projects following these two interaction styles.",,0,0,0,0,0,conferencePaper,2016,"André, Elisabeth",Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces,978-1-4503-4137-0,,59WVUKXJ,10.1145/2856767.2856799,https://doi.org/10.1145/2856767.2856799,2016-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T21:33:25Z,2021-02-15T21:33:25Z,,305,,,,,,,IUI '16,,,,Association for Computing Machinery,"New York, NY, USA",,,,,,,,"event-place: Sonoma, California, USA",,,affective computing; social signal processing; empathic stimulation; social augmentation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ACM,socially-sensitive interfaces: from offline studies to interactive experiences,sociallysensitive interfaces from offline studies to interactive experiences

However, these findings do not reflect the lived experiences of people with LDs. To shed light on this disparity, a team of co-researchers with LDs created the first online survey to challenge public understanding of LDs, asking questions in ways that are important to them and represent how they see themselves. Here, we describe and evaluate the process of creating an accessible survey platform and an online survey in a research team consisting of academic and non-academic professionals with and without LDs or autism. Through this inclusive research process, the co-designed survey met the expectations of the co-researchers and was well-received by the initial survey respondents.

The use of music to help manage the symptoms of dementia is often guided by a music therapist who adapts the intervention to respond to the changing needs of the person living with dementia. However, as the incidence of dementia increases worldwide, individualised therapy programs are less feasible, making it valuable to consider technology-based approaches. In this paper, we analyze data from case studies of home-based music therapy training interventions with two families. The findings show that embodied interactions supported the therapist in responding to the needs of the PwD and built an empathic environment that empowered the caregivers’ learning.

But whereas it is par for the course for end-user perspectives to be included during early design stages in UX, there is little methodological support or research into how to incorporate player perspectives into early stages of game design. In this paper, we introduce muse-based game design, an experimental empathic design approach foregrounding a dialogic artist – muse relationship between a game designer and player. Following a user research stage focused on learning about the player, the designer forms idiosyncratic design constraints inspired by and relating to the player, which are then used to inspire ideation.

Traditional and Agile methods lay the foundation for building ""functional software products"" that meet the requirements of a system of a larger scope. However, if we consider software as a product that frequently has the mission of satisfying the needs of human users, we can go beyond the typical ""analysis - design - implementation - testing"" process, to reinterpret it with the ""empathize - define - ideate - prototype - testing"" proposed by Design Thinking, a development methodology commonly used in creative and innovative professional settings. In this work, we study the use of Design Thinking as a methodological approach for the instruction of Software Engineering at undergraduate level, in courses that have the particular aim of creating innovative software products from scratch. We describe the similarities and differences between Design Thinking and Software Development Processes, taking as instance Agile Practices. We compare evidence on methods and deliverables produced by students in their learning path using Agile Practices and Design Thinking in two different educational environments.

At our CHI 2015 workshop on ethical encounters, researchers shared personal stories of the challenges and tensions they have faced when conducting HCI research in complex settings such as hospitals, with young mental health patients, in schools for children with disabilities, and with homeless people. These research contexts can present significant challenges for HCI researchers who would not typically receive the training that other professionals working in these environments would normally receive. From our discussions with attendees at the CHI 2015 workshop, we identified a number of ethical issues that researchers are grappling with.

,,,,,,,,,,Child Designers Creating Personas to Diversify Design Perspectives and Concepts for Their Own Technology Enhanced Library,"We report on a participatory design project that explored the use of child-created Personas to enable child designers to empathize with other children thereby contributing multiple divergent perspectives. The ongoing project aims to promote reading and creative writing skills among young children in Namibia. For decades libraries worldwide have been the key actors in fostering reading. Hence, in order to maintain their relevance, they are being re-conceptualized to cater for new needs and aspirations in the 21st century. In Namibia, dysfunctional public and school library services are lagging behind in this renovation effort, and are not contributing to the promotion of a reading culture. In an ongoing collaboration with a school in Windhoek, to design and implement an interactive tech library, 19 young learners engaged in weekly participatory design workshops to redesign their own school library. The children first created four distinct Personas for which they then modelled spaces and technologies.

,,,,,,,,,,Case Study: Designing an Advanced Visualization System for Geological Core Drilling Expeditions,"We present the design and process of an interactive high-resolution visualization system for diverse and distributed real-world geological core drilling expeditions. The high domain knowledge barrier makes it difficult for a person who is outside this field to imagine the user experience, and the globally distributed core drilling community imposes more design constraints in space and time. In addition to activities proposed in prior literatures, we used the ""immersive empathic design"" approach of having a computer scientist trained as a junior core technician. Through in-situ observation and interview evaluations from on-going expeditions, we present the system and the lesson learned in the process. It makes the best use of precious co-located opportunities. It allows the developer to build up domain knowledge efficiently. It establishes a trust relationship between the developer and scientists. The system designed through this approach formed a sustainable foundation that was adapted in the following design iterations. This process allows the software developer to experience authentic user activities. The designed system is innovative and helps scientists solving real-world problems. This approach can be a useful example to HCI practitioners who work with potential users or communities that share similar properties.",,0,0,0,0,0,conferencePaper,2010,"Chen, Yu-Chung; Lee, Sangyoon; Hur, HyeJung; Leigh, Jason; Johnson, Andrew; Renambot, Luc",CHI '10 Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing Systems,978-1-60558-930-5,,WW8G3BZS,10.1145/1753846.1754206,https://doi.org/10.1145/1753846.1754206,2010-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T21:33:27Z,2021-02-15T21:33:27Z,,4645–4660,,,,,,,CHI EA '10,,,,Association for Computing Machinery,"New York, NY, USA",,,,,,,,"event-place: Atlanta, Georgia, USA",,,empathic design; visualization; hci,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ACM,case study: designing an advanced visualization system for geological core drilling expeditions,case study designing an advanced visualization system for geological core drilling expeditions

It concerns designing for the complex persuasive situation of helping parents of hospitalized children take better care of themselves. Our focus was on the experiences, on how these were designed to be persuasive, and on the design process needed to achieve that. We conclude that designing for complex persuasive experiences requires a design approach that allows for designers to gradually develop a rich understanding of the situation and develop empathy for the people they design for. We found that the persuasion should focus on a combination of starting a new practice, sustaining it, starting activities within the practice, and extending the duration of the activities. For such a complex persuasive situation a rich palette of experiences was needed. The design of those experiences was inspired by universal human needs and by gaining a deep and empathetic understanding of the situation.",,0,0,0,0,0,conferencePaper,2014,"Vermeeren, Arnold P.O.S.; van Beusekom, Josje; Rozendaal, Marco C.; Giaccardi, Elisa",Proceedings of the 2014 Conference on Designing Interactive Systems,978-1-4503-2902-6,,45X22KPU,10.1145/2598510.2598548,https://doi.org/10.1145/2598510.2598548,2014-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T21:34:47Z,2021-02-15T21:34:47Z,,335–344,,,,,,,DIS '14,,,,Association for Computing Machinery,"New York, NY, USA",,,,,,,,"event-place: Vancouver, BC, Canada",,,behavior change; design approach; experience design; persuasive experiences; persuasive technology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ACM,design for complex persuasive experiences: helping parents of hospitalized children take care of themselves,design for complex persuasive experiences helping parents of hospitalized children take care of themselves

The moving image changes according to the two people's facial expressions. Different from traditional ways of communication, ""Let's Chat Like This"" focuses more on the emotional aspect of communication. It shows a visualization of the complexity of human emotion and boosts people's emotional communication in a creative no-verbal way. When experiencing this work, people's emotions are bound together with the same moving image they see. The moving image changes depending on their moods. They will be aware of their current moods as well as the other's, the intimacy and empathy between them will be increased.This is not only a ""social distancing"" art installation that helps us connect emotionally during the COVID-19 pandemic, but also my hypothesis of what future emotional communication will be like.

,,,,,,,,,,The Penguin and the Leviathan: Towards Cooperative Human Systems Design,"A decade ago, Wikipedia burst into a world not ready to comprehend it. Thousands of people cooperating effectively, without price signals to offer 'incentives' or managerial hierarchy to direct efforts, was an impossibility. And yet, it moves. And as it moved it combined with a deep shift across many disciplines, from biology and neuroscience to organizational sociology, experimental economics, and social psychology to paint a very different view of who we are as human beings. Slowly pushing back against decades of ever-refined analyses based on self-interested rationality, we begin to see that we are diverse beings; that a majority of us responds cooperatively to cooperative settings–we tend to treat well those who have treated us well, rather than take advantage of them; we tend to do what we think is right and fair, when it is clear in the setting what that is; we experience empathy, and it makes us more generous and trustworthy; we experience solidarity with others, and that makes us contributed more willingly to the group's goals. Moreover, explicit payments, the touchstone of mechanism design under universal self-interested rationality, turns out to have a much more complex relationship with motivation than simple addition. All this work in basic behavioral sciences combines with observations from organizational sociology, political science, and management studies combines with social software to provide an increasingly better articulated basis on which to develop a field of cooperative human systems design.",,0,0,0,0,0,conferencePaper,2012,"Benkler, Yochai",Proceedings of the ACM 2012 Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work,978-1-4503-1086-4,,ZMZ4J7F5,10.1145/2145204.2145206,https://doi.org/10.1145/2145204.2145206,2012-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T21:34:48Z,2021-02-15T21:34:48Z,,1–2,,,,,,,CSCW '12,,,,Association for Computing Machinery,"New York, NY, USA",,,,,,,,"event-place: Seattle, Washington, USA",,,cooperative human systems design,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ACM,the penguin and the leviathan: towards cooperative human systems design,the penguin and the leviathan towards cooperative human systems design
,,,,,,,,,,"Perceived Authenticity, Empathy, and Pro-Social Intentions Evoked through Avatar-Mediated Self-Disclosures","Avatars are our digital embodied alter egos. Virtual embodiment by avatars allows social interaction with others using the full spectrum of verbal and non-verbal behaviour. Still, one's avatar appearances is elective. Hence, avatars make it possible for users to discuss and exchange sensible or even problematic personal topics potentially hiding their real identity and hence preserving anonymity and privacy. While previous works identified similarities how participants perceive avatars compared to human stimuli, there is a question as to whether avatar-mediated self-disclosure is authentic and results in similar social responses. In the present study, we created a comparable stimulus set to investigate this issue and conducted an online study (N=172) for comparison. Our results indicate that avatars can be perceived as authentic and that empathy is attributed in similar level than to a human stimulus. In an exploratory model, we found that for in the overall results, authenticity fostered emotional empathy which in turn fostered pro-social intentions.

A video camera was used to capture an actor's performance. The actor's eyes and mouth were isolated, and footage was processed as movie textures to overlay a static 3D model of a head. Micro-expressions (subtle, rapid movements of muscles in and around the eyes and mouth in particular) are thus captured in a fine-grained, yet low- cost and low-tech alternative to established techniques. A future experiment will compare the emotive efficacy of the hybrid virtual agent with that of a conventional (fully CG) rigged avatar head in a 6DoF scenario that transitions from sympathetic (gauging empathy by self-report) to confrontational (gauging physiological arousal by heart-rate or GSR).

Based on the results of a cross-sectional survey of 544 World of Warcraft players the measurement instrument's proposed factorial structure was confirmed. Subsequently, the constructs were successfully tested both for convergent and discriminant validity. Finally, evidence for nomological validity was gathered by testing ten theoretically rooted hypotheses regarding the effects of Player Identification.

,,,,,,,,,,The Design and Evaluation of a Body-Sensing Video Game to Foster Empathy towards Chronic Pain Patients,"Chronic Pain (CP) has been identified as a complex medical condition, one that is difficult for sufferers to articulate and for others to discern. This may interfere with the ability of a patient's family, friends and healthcare practitioners to understand what it is like to live with CP, or to even believe it exists. A reluctance by or ability of others to believe a CP patient may in turn exacerbate pain and sequelae common in CP, such as depression, frustration, stigma or social isolation. The goal of this research is to help foster empathy of what CP patients experience by designing and evaluating a body-sensing video game titled AS IF. In this game, players ""inhabit"" a virtual body or avatar of a CP patient. The virtual body simulates physical limitations and displays red areas meant to indicate painful areas. A pilot study with 15 participants was conducted. Results show that while not every aspect of the game proved successful, players had a significant increase in their willingness to help patients.

,,,,,,,,,,Dynamic Music and Immersion in the Action-Adventure an Empirical Investigation,"Aiming to immerse players into a new realm of drama experience, a growing number of video games utilize interactive, 'dynamic' music that reacts adaptively to game events. Though little is known about the involved perceptual processes, the design rationale of enhanced immersive experiences is taken over by public discussion including scientific accounts, despite lacking empirical validation. The present paper intends to fill this gap by hypothesizing facilitatory effects of dynamic music on attention allocation in the matching of expected and incoming expressive characteristics of concurrent stimuli. Moreover, personality constructs are investigated in mediating the decoding and sensing of experiences linked to immersion, presence, and emotion. The experiment explored experiential states of immersion, emotional valence/arousal as well as trait music empathizing and emotional involvement in the context of dynamic and non-dynamic music. 60 subjects answered self-report questionnaires each time after playing a 3rd-person action-adventure in one of three conditions accounting for (1) dynamic music, (2) non-dynamic music/low arousal potential and (3) non-dynamic music/high arousal potential, in this way aiming to manipulate structural-temporal alignment, emotional arousal and resulting congruency of nondiegetic music.

,,,,,,,,,,Cyrafour: An Experiential Activity Facilitating Empathic Distant Communication among Copresent Individuals,"Distant communication relies mostly on a non-embodied representation of participants (e.g. textual in chats, photographic in videoconference, auditory in telephony, etc) that lessens the sensory richness of conversational interactions. Cyrafour is a novel activity that explores the implications of using human avatars (cyranoids) for empathic interpersonal remote communication. An unscripted conversation between two individuals (the sources) is transmitted through radio waves and reproduced by two copresent subjects (the cyranoids) following certain conversational guidelines.

,,,,,,,,,,Empathy Amulet: A Wearable to Connect with Strangers,"The Empathy Amulet is a wearable interpretation of Philip K. Dick's empathy box from his novel Do Androids Dream of Electronic Sheep? [3]. In the novel, thousands of people were anonymously connected with each other both haptically and emotionally when they grabbed the handles of their empathy boxes. The Empathy Amulet similarly networks a group of strangers together through shared experiences of physical warmth. It is not yet another technology for staying in touch with people you already know (and falling short). Rather, it encourages its wearer to make a deliberate and generous choice to invest their time and energy in connection with strangers, and it incorporates reciprocity into its design, such that helping oneself means helping other people. In today's world, people are less likely to feel empathy towards those not in their immediate network of family and friends, and, despite a proliferation of connective technologies, loneliness is on the rise [2, 5]. Surprisingly, it is the perceived sense of loneliness, and not actually being physically alone that has numerous health consequences for a significant portion of the population. Lakoff and Johnson's theory of embodied mind asserts that our physical and subjective experiences are inextricably linked, and the Empathy Amulet leverages the powerful connection between the physical experience of warmth and the subjective experience of social connectedness to combat loneliness and cultivate a stronger sense of connection with strangers [1, 4].",,0,0,0,0,0,conferencePaper,2018,"Brueckner, Sophia",Proceedings of the 2018 ACM International Symposium on Wearable Computers,978-1-4503-5967-2,,KD9RUDW8,10.1145/3267242.3267301,https://doi.org/10.1145/3267242.3267301,2018-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T21:36:05Z,2021-02-15T21:36:05Z,,248–253,,,,,,,ISWC '18,,,,Association for Computing Machinery,"New York, NY, USA",,,,,,,,"event-place: Singapore, Singapore",,,embodied cognition; haptic I/O; internet of things; prototyping; wearable electronics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ACM,empathy amulet: a wearable to connect with strangers,empathy amulet a wearable to connect with strangers

While these services represent a new mode of healthcare delivery, study of these online health communities and how they are used is limited. In particular, it is unknown if these platforms replicate existing barriers and biases in traditional healthcare delivery across demographic groups. We present an analysis of AskDocs, a subreddit that functions as a public AtD platform on social media. We examine the demographics of users, the health topics discussed, if biases present in offline healthcare settings exist on this platform, and how empathy is expressed in interactions between users and physicians. Our findings suggest a number of implications to enhance and support peer-to-peer and patient-provider interactions on online platforms.

Anonymity and ease of access drive self-disclosure of even the most serious problems. Rich nonverbal communication, co-presence, and real-time interaction increase emotional closeness. However, there has not been much research with regard to examining social support in avatar communication. In this paper, we aim to facilitate self-disclosure and social support for bullied people through avatar communication. For this purpose, we analyzed verbal and nonverbal communication about bullying experiences through an avatar communication service. We demonstrate that people who emotionally disclosed their bullying experiences received better social support. In addition, people who provided social support used emotional expressions to convey emotional empathy. These were observed in conversations with a few acquaintances in closed spaces. Our findings reveal areas where we can improve upon the design of avatar communication spaces for effective social support.

Predictive evaluation reveals that language models trained on Facebook posts are more accurate at predicting age, gender, stress, and empathy than those trained on Twitter posts. Qualitative analyses of the underlying linguistic and demographic differences reveal that users are significantly more likely to disclose information about their family, personal concerns, and emotions and provide a more 'honest' self-representation on Facebook. On the other hand, the same users significantly preferred to disclose their needs, drives, and ambitions on Twitter. The higher predictive performance of Facebook is also partly due to the greater volume of language on Facebook than Twitter - Facebook and Twitter are equally good at predicting user traits when the same-sized language samples are used to train language models. We explore the implications of these differences in cross-platform user trait prediction. Copyright © 2018, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

,,,,,,,,,,Recognizing pathogenic empathy in social media,"Empathy is an integral part of human social life, as people care about and for others who experience adversity. However, a specific ""pathogenic"" form of empathy, marked by automatic contagion of negative emotions, can lead to stress and burnout. This is particularly detrimental for individuals in caregiving professions who experience empathic states more frequently, because it can result in illness and high costs for health systems. Automatically recognizing pathogenic empathy from text is potentially valuable to identify at-risk individuals and monitor burnout risk in caregiving populations. We build a model to predict this type of empathy from social media language on a data set we collected of users' Facebook posts and their answers to a new questionnaire measuring empathy. We obtain promising results in identifying individuals' empathetic states from their social media (Pearson r = 0.252, p < 0.003). © Copyright 2017, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

,,,,,,,,,,Training with virtual operating room teammates to influence team behaviors,"Imagine you are an operating room nurse. Could training with virtual human teammates empower you to speak up to a bullying teammate? Could virtual teammates change the way you speak as to reduce errors? How about learn new patient safety policies or efficiently transfer care? In this talk, we will explore the emerging area of using virtual humans to subtly influence healthcare teams' teamwork and communication skills. This application of virtual humans could have significant patient safety impact as teamwork and communication is the top reason for adverse events in critical care areas, such as the emergency room, intensive care unit, and operating room. We will examine the latest research into simulating healthcare teams with mixed reality humans. Mixed reality humans are virtual humans that can share the same physical space as the user. These virtual humans combine interactive graphics, natural language processing, artificial intelligence, human-computer interaction, and data mining to create in situ learning experiences. In these learning experiences, critical care personnel can work to improve teamwork with life-sized interactive virtual team-mates [1]. These learning experiences can also help implement best-practices to address address difficult teamwork concepts such as authority gradients, conflict negotiation, empathy and critical thinking [2][3]. Our research team (Samsun Lampotang, Anesthesia Department, University of Florida, Adam Wendling, Anesthesia Department, University of Florida, and Casey White, College of Medicine, University of Virginia) has developed VR hardware and software platforms to create compelling experiences for users to work on teams with mixed reality humans (MRHs). MRHs are virtual humans that can inhabit the user's physical space [4]. The MRH virtual team members can respond to the user's speech and actions and respond with natural speech and gestures. The virtual team members cannot physically interact with the environment. However, they can present realistic personalities and role-play the roles of operating room teammates, such as surgeons, anesthesiologists, nurses, and surgical technicians. The virtual team members combine the benefits of dynamic visuals of virtual humans with the physicality of mannequins (Figure 1). (Figure Presented) The virtual teammates are composed of comprise a minitower desktop for computation, networking, and rendering, a 40′ TV for display, and a Microsoft Kinect® (version 2) for tracking. All of these components are mounted onto a TV stand. Additionally, a Sennheiser DW-Pro 1 wireless headset is used for speech capture. ANDI's torso, arms, and head are rendered using a virtual human model from Autodesk's Character Generator. The virtual teammate's legs were physical and were composed of shoes and pants filled with stuffing. The physical props were used to integrate the virtual teammate into the user's space. A series of studies evaluated the social presence impact of ANDI design decisions and the current system configuration was shown to provide a virtual teammate with which participants reported a high sense of presence [5]. The virtual teammates' audio responses are pre-recorded by voice talent, and gestures are generated using motion capture and professionally key-framed animations. The virtual teammates can gaze at whoever is speaking, and intermittently glance at the other team members. They also blink and mimic idle motions when not speaking. We will examine results from studies evaluating the perception of virtual teammates, lessons learned in integrating such systems into hospital training, and areas for future research. © 2016 IEEE.",,0,0,0,0,0,conferencePaper,2016,"Lok, B.","Proceedings - 2016 International Conference on Collaboration Technologies and Systems, CTS 2016",,,X7IQBZ76,10.1109/CTS.2016.115,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85016990802&doi=10.1109%2fCTS.2016.115&partnerID=40&md5=43b8f2a891be99dc9798e92fe575cfde,2016-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:34:01Z,2021-02-15T22:34:01Z,,615-616,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 0</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,training with virtual operating room teammates to influence team behaviors,training with virtual operating room teammates to influence team behaviors

People often spend most of their time in completely different places from their neighbors, and this fragmentation of society leads to reduced empathy, policy quarrels, and even violence. People may not even be aware that they are segregating themselves so dramatically. Fortunately, thanks to the abundance of available geotagged social media data, we can easily and cheaply detect these social bubbles and give people a greater insight into their activity patterns. Understanding how we spend our time can be the first step in changing from isolated citizens into a connected community. © Copyright 2014.

The recent revolution in portable self-tracking devices in the data-driven wellness movement and participatory-driven wellness communities, such as the Quantified Self community, provides us with new opportunities to collect psychological or physiological data for understanding the human mind. While new technologies make it possible to track our daily behavior and various biological signals such as physiological or genetic data more easily, one of the important remaining challenges is to discover our own truly meaningful personal values. Citizen science, scientific research by crowdsourcing or human-based computation, is a new and challenging framework that promotes interdisciplinary research in the fields of computer science, life/brain science, and social psychological/ behavioral science, which may introduce new paradigms to the AI community. We have been working on citizen science projects related to the area of personal genomics and have developed a personal genomics information environment named MyFinder.

,,,,,,,,,,Brain structure and individual differences in social behaviors,"Brain structure exhibits systematic relationships with a variety of an individual's cognitive abilities and such relationships can be captured by voxel-based morphometry (VBM) that computes regional gray matter volume based on anatomical MRIs. This method has been successfully used to reveal brain regions that are associated with individual differences in a broad range of contexts such as perceptual performance, attention control, face recognition, introspection and personality traits (Kanai & Rees 2011). Here, we show that such relationships with brain structure extend to complex social behaviors by presenting our recent VBM studies that examined the relationships between brain structure and diverse aspects of socio-cognitive behavioral traits. Specifically, we identified brain regions in which individual differences in gray matter volumes were associated with political orientation, moral sentiment, empathy and loneliness. These findings suggest that information derived from standard MRI scans could be used to extract information about an individual's real-world and online social behavior. Unlike conventional functional neuroimaging research, our structural neuroimaging approach does not require a virtual environment that emulates social interactions and thus can directly link brain structure to real-world human behavior.

With children, the results of interaction with the robot are quite satisfactory in a short-term experiment. However, it was noted that during long-term interaction between the children and the robot, the relationship changes as a kind of lassitude sets up. Thus, the question addressed here is, how can we make a robot acceptable for long-term interaction?

Besides health problems, during the social distancing restrictions, the elderly were also strongly affected by loneliness due to a lack of contact with their loved ones. Innovative solutions for ALH based on Social Assistive Robotics can reduce the risk of infection and, at the same time, improve the quality of life of elderly people.

,,,,,,,,,,Relation between degree of empathy for narrative speech and type of responsive utterance in attentive listening,"Nowadays, spoken dialogue agents such as communication robots and smart speakers listen to narratives of humans. In order for such an agent to be recognized as a listener of narratives and convey the attitude of attentive listening, it is necessary to generate responsive utterances. Moreover, responsive utterances can express empathy to narratives and showing an appropriate degree of empathy to narratives is significant for enhancing speaker's motivation. The degree of empathy shown by responsive utterances is thought to depend on their type. However, the relation between responsive utterances and degrees of the empathy has not been explored yet. This paper describes the classification of responsive utterances based on the degree of empathy in order to explain that relation. In this research, responsive utterances are classified into five levels based on the effect of utterances and literature on attentive listening. Quantitative evaluations using 37,995 responsive utterances showed the appropriateness of the proposed classification. © European Language Resources Association (ELRA), licensed under CC-BY-NC",,0,0,0,0,0,conferencePaper,2020,"Ito, K.; Murata, M.; Ohno, T.; Matsubara, S.","LREC 2020 - 12th International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation, Conference Proceedings",,,CGA5ZMFC,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096512903&partnerID=40&md5=1ff80d168c8d91743e767819a0d7b887,2020-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:35:18Z,2021-02-15T22:35:18Z,,696-701,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 0</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,relation between degree of empathy for narrative speech and type of responsive utterance in attentive listening,relation between degree of empathy for narrative speech and type of responsive utterance in attentive listening

,,,,,,,,,,Digital empathy secures Frankenstein’s monster,"People’s worries about robot and AI software and how it can go wrong have led them to think of it and its associated algorithms and programs as being like Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein monster. The term Franken-algorithms has been used. Furthermore, there are concerns about driverless cars, automated General Practitioner Doctors (GPs) and robotic surgeons, legal expert systems, and particularly autonomous military drones. Digital Empathy grows when people and computers place themselves in each other’s shoes. Some would argue that for too long people have discriminated against computers and robots by saying that they are only as good as what we put into them. However, in recent times computers have outperformed people, beating world champions at the Asian game of Go (2017), Jeopardy (2011) and chess (1997), mastering precision in medical surgical operations (STAR) and diagnosis (Watson), and in specific speech and image recognition tasks. Computers have also composed music (AIVA), generated art (Aaron), stories (Quill) and poetry (Google AI). In terms of calling for more Digital Empathy between machines and people, we refer here to theories, computational models, algorithms and systems for detecting, representing and responding to people’s emotions and sentiment in speech and images but also for people’s goals, plans, beliefs and intentions. In reciprocation, people should have more empathy with machines allowing for their mistakes and also accepting that they will be better than people at performing particular tasks involving large data sets where fast decisions may need to be made, keeping in mind that they are not as prone as people to becoming tired. We conclude that if digital souls are programmed with Digital Empathy, and people have more empathy with them, by doing unto them as we would have them do unto us, this will help to secure Shelley’s monster. © 2019 CEUR-WS.

,,,,,,,,,,Exploring social co-presence through movement in human-robot encounters,"This paper explores the social capacity of robots as an emergent phenomenon of the exchange between humans and robots, rather than an intrinsic property of robots as is often assumed in social robotics research. Using our Performative Body Mapping (PBM) approach, we have developed a robotic object for studying how social meaning is enacted when movement qualities meet kinesthetic empathy. In this paper we introduce PBM and how it harnesses performers' kinesthetic imagination and movement expertise for designing the movement potential and movement qualities of abstract, non-humanlike robots. We then present our recent study of how the social presence of our robotic object-in-motion emerges in an encounter, involving experts from performance and design. Preliminary results of this study show that our robotic object can successfully convey movement qualities and their intended expressions as embodied by a dancer as part of the PBM process. Finally, we discuss how our observations can shift our focus from attributing qualities to the object to an emergence of qualities, propelled by the encounter. We believe our study provides a glimpse into the dynamic enactment of agency and how it requires both sides to 'give' for the robotic object's characteristics and the participants' experience to evolve. © 2019 AISB Convention.All right reserved.",,0,0,0,0,0,conferencePaper,2019,"Gemeinboeck, P.; Saunders, R.",2019 AISB Convention,,,QGQ6BJEA,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075273167&partnerID=40&md5=25ec4efb84ecdc0459bba9ce60def3df,2019-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:35:21Z,2021-02-15T22:35:21Z,,31-37,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 0</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,exploring social co-presence through movement in human-robot encounters,exploring social copresence through movement in humanrobot encounters

What if a robot had a hobby? How do robots make aesthetic decisions? What is a robot’s point of view? It seeks to shift perception of robotic agency and allow the audience to embody the robotic gardeners’ vision, behavior and influence its aesthetics. By amplifying perceptual differences between humans and robots and we allow for both tangible and virtual embodiment experiences from multiple scales and perspectives. This compelling design speculation seeks to deploy a variety of interactive computational techniques, exploring novel forms and behaviors in order to engage deeper philosophical issues surrounding aesthetics, non-human agencies, and the role of the synthetic in the future. © 2015 ACADIA.

The mask is generated by a graphical-user-interface platform displayed on a tablet used to control the robot in a smart home environment. The hypothesis of the study is that when robot's behaviour conforms to human social expectations, interactions are more likely to be found enjoyable and meaningful by people. Furthermore the expressivity of the mask is expected to result in empathic interactions with the robot and therefore to sustain rich and meaningful social exchanges. In this study we compared four scenarios of interaction between a robot and a person at home. The scenarios depicted scenes where the robot was asked to execute tasks. Each scenario was showed in two versions: with a static robot-view and with a dynamic, expressive robot-view. The results of a questionnaire administered to 60 persons showed a preference of people to interact with the dynamic expressive mask. Expressivity was a means to stimulate empathic concern and to facilitate perspective taking during the execution of the scenarios. © 2013 IEEE.",,0,0,0,0,0,conferencePaper,2013,"Marti, P.; Iacono, I.; Tittarelli, M.; Stienstra, J.",Proceedings - IEEE International Workshop on Robot and Human Interactive Communication,,,DPPSIY9B,10.1109/ROMAN.2013.6628403,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84889605391&doi=10.1109%2fROMAN.2013.6628403&partnerID=40&md5=c90b77dbc8dda0f686c942f72e051ecd,2013-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:35:29Z,2021-02-15T22:35:29Z,,751-756,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 5</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,shaping empathy through perspective taking,shaping empathy through perspective taking

The multifaceted nature of moral intelligence complicates both the task of designing artificial moral agents (AMAs) and the challenge of evaluating whether an artificial agent can make safe, legal, and appropriate decisions. Confronted with a somewhat comparable difficulty in determining whether a machine can think, Alan Turing [1] proposed his now famous imitation game. Fifty years later, Colin Allen, Gary Varner, and Jason Zinser [2] suggested a variant of the test: a moral Turing test (MTT). Within some limited domains, reason alone is sufficient for making moral judgments, and moral intelligence may be tested by using the traditional conversational method of posing a question and comparing the AI system's response to that of a human. However, evaluating an artificial agent's ability to accommodate a variety of moral considerations, including some that are difficult to quantify or describe, will necessitate testing it in complex situations. Consider the ability of an artificial agent to deduce the beliefs, desires, and intentions of other agents so that it might work cooperatively with them on a shared task, to distinguish a combatant from a non-combatant during guerrilla warfare, to discern that it is in a morally significant situation, or to discriminate which of many concurrent challenges it should respond to first. These tasks are not easy for humans, and yet we bring resources to bear in tackling such challenges that will be hard to reproduce artificially. Evaluating whether AI systems can manage such tasks sufficiently will either require special variants of the MTT, or they reveal the inadequacy of a MTT for evaluating the moral intelligence of artificial systems.",,0,0,0,0,0,conferencePaper,2012,"Wallach, W.; Allen, C.","AISB/IACAP World Congress 2012: Moral Cognition and Theory of Mind, Part of Alan Turing Year 2012",,,XMM8BFKJ,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84893196594&partnerID=40&md5=984e7b89899e5cf0d4d527848dc72d3b,2012-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:35:30Z,2021-02-15T22:35:30Z,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 1</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,hard problems: framing the chinese room in which a robot takes a moral turing test,hard problems framing the chinese room in which a robot takes a moral turing test

However, the information-seeking process can be exhausting, cumbersome and even confusing for migrants as they must cope with time-consuming information overload while searching desired information from lists of documents. Chatbots are easy-to-use, natural, and intuitive, and thus could support information-seeking. There is a lack of research that engages and empowers migrants and other stakeholders as co-design participants in chatbot development. We explored how migrants can be empowered in designing a chatbot that supports their social integration. Using a co-design approach, we conducted a series of activities with migrants and other stakeholders (i.e., online questionnaires, empathy probes, surveys, and co-design workshops) to first understand their expectations regarding chatbots, and then co-design a personality-driven chatbot. We found that chatbot personality can drive co-designing a chatbot as design goals, design directions, and design criteria. © 2020 Owner/Author.",,0,0,0,0,0,conferencePaper,2020,"Chen, Z.; Lu, Y.; Nieminen, M.P.; Lucero, A.",DIS 2020 - Proceedings of the 2020 ACM Designing Interactive Systems Conference,,,GNLDX3C2,10.1145/3357236.3395495,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090504800&doi=10.1145%2f3357236.3395495&partnerID=40&md5=f1462d9b4b9746c6d634685538c4ee2d,2020-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:35:56Z,2021-02-15T22:35:56Z,,219-230,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 0</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,creating a chatbot for and with migrants: chatbot personality drives co-design activities,creating a chatbot for and with migrants chatbot personality drives codesign activities

Yet, applying it to UX research (UXR) received little academic attention so far. To better understand how UX practitioners envision the synergies between empathy-focused UX work and data-driven ML techniques, we surveyed 49 practitioners experienced in UX, ML, or both and conducted 13 semi-structured interviews with UX experts. We derived an inventory of ML's impact on current UXR activities and practitioners' predictions about its potentials. We learned that ML methods may help to automate mundane tasks, complement decisions with data-driven insights, and enrich UXR with insights from users' emotional worlds. Challenges may arise from a potential obligation to utilize data and a more restrictive access to user data. We embed our insights into recent academic work on ML for UXR and discuss automated UX evaluation as a promising use case for future research. © 2020 ACM.",,0,0,0,0,0,conferencePaper,2020,"Chromik, M.; Lachner, F.; Butz, A.",ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,,,BBBKNTGV,10.1145/3419249.3420163,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85095825746&doi=10.1145%2f3419249.3420163&partnerID=40&md5=57bb98a9ac0c0565b43777fe83bbcc28,2020-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:36:21Z,2021-02-15T22:36:21Z,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 0</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,ml for ux? - an inventory and predictions on the use of machine learning techniques for ux research,ml for ux an inventory and predictions on the use of machine learning techniques for ux research
,,,,,,,,,,Exploiting deep neural networks for tweet-based emoji prediction,"For many years now, emojis have been used in social networks and chat services in order to enrich written text with auxiliary graphical content, achieving a higher degree of empathy. In particular, given the wide use of this medium, emojis are now available in such a number and variety that every basic concept and mood is covered by at least one. For this reason, the connection between the emoji and its semantical meaning grows stronger. In this paper, we will be describing the work performed in order to develop a Machine Learning based tool that, given a tweet, predicts the most likely emoji associated with the text. The task resembles the one presented by Barbieri et al., [23], and is placed within the context of the International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval) 2018. We designed a baseline with standard Support Vector Machines and another baseline based on fastText, which was provided as part of the Workshop. In addition, we implemented several models based on Neural Networks such as Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks. We found that the latter is the most effective since it outperformed all our models and ranks in the 6th position out of 47 total participants. Our work aims to illustrate the potential of simpler models, which, thanks to the fine-tuning of hyper-parameters, could achieve accuracy comparable to the more complex models of the challenge. © 2018 CEUR-WS.

Here, as a first step to answering this big question, we present a design method for telepathic products applied to the case study of a kitchen faucet. The case study is used to illustrate the different steps of the design method: (A) Build cognitive empathy and define cognitive styles; (B) Define design requirements, articulate variables that will control performance, understand limitations and design physical product; (C) Design the machine learning algorithm, inputs, and outputs; and (D) Integration and refinement. This work-in-progress report highlights the intricacies of applying adaptive machinelearning behavior to physical products performance in the ""real world"" rather than to a website or device such as a smart phone. Interesting findings include that automatic response, typically associated with websites and phones, is not possible with plumbing as water cannot be instantly at the right temperature; and that cognitive styles indeed manifest in dish washing observations, with distinctly different styles in terms of patience, temperature sensitivity, and laziness.",,0,0,0,0,0,conferencePaper,2017,"Ramaswamy, N.; MacDonald, E.","Proceedings of the International Conference on Engineering Design, ICED",,,TPAS9M8A,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85029740073&partnerID=40&md5=0f5e5840bdf2bc50fe33cc19d5ccde90,2017-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:36:24Z,2021-02-15T22:36:24Z,,169-178,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Issue: DS87-1,<p>cited By 0</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,telepathic product design for water conservation,telepathic product design for water conservation

These modules allow otherwise conventional dialogue systems to have “empathy” and answer to the user while being aware of their emotion and intent. Emotion recognition from speech previously consists of feature engineering and machine learning where the first stage causes delay in decoding time. We describe a CNN model to extract emotion from raw speech input without feature engineering. This approach even achieves an impressive average of 65.7% accuracy on six emotion categories, a 4.5% improvement when compared to the conventional feature based SVM classification. A separate, CNN-based sentiment analysis module recognizes sentiments from speech recognition results, with 82.5 F-measure on human-machine dialogues when trained with out-of-domain data. © 2016 Association for Computational Linguistics",,0,0,0,0,0,conferencePaper,2016,"Bertero, D.; Siddique, F.B.; Wu, C.-S.; Wan, Y.; Chan, R.H.Y.; Fung, P.","EMNLP 2016 - Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, Proceedings",,,EUVAVT38,10.18653/v1/d16-1110,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85072837881&doi=10.18653%2fv1%2fd16-1110&partnerID=40&md5=cb47e47a58a6fe6643e7e847811cbdc0,2016-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:36:24Z,2021-02-15T22:36:24Z,,1042-1047,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 27</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,real-time speech emotion and sentiment recognition for interactive dialogue systems,realtime speech emotion and sentiment recognition for interactive dialogue systems

Despite several studies on when to backchannel, most of the current spoken dialogue systems generate the same pattern of backchannels, giving monotonous impressions to users. In this work, we investigate generation of a variety of backchannel forms according to the dialogue context. We first show the feasibility of choosing appropriate backchannel forms based on machine learning, and the synergy of using linguistic and prosodic features. For generation of backchannels, a framework based on a set of binary classifiers is adopted to effectively make a ""not-to-generate"" decision. The proposed model achieved better prediction accuracy than a baseline which always outputs the same backchannel form and another baseline which randomly generates backchannels. Finally, evaluations by human subjects demonstrate that the proposed method generates backchannels as naturally as human choices, giving impressions of understanding and empathy.

Emotion analysis of text is increasing in popularity in NLP; however, manually creating lexica for psychological constructs such as empathy has proven difficult. This paper automatically creates empathy word ratings from document-level ratings. The underlying problem of learning word ratings from higher-level supervision has to date only been addressed in an ad hoc fashion and has not used deep learning methods. We systematically compare a number of approaches to learning word ratings from higher-level supervision against a Mixed-Level Feed Forward Network (MLFFN), which we find performs best, and use the MLFFN to create the first-ever empathy lexicon. We then use Signed Spectral Clustering to gain insights into the resulting words.

,,,,,,,,,,Enhancing deeper learning using empathy and creativity in serious games role-play simulations,"There is a shift in education towards adopting pedagogical approaches that nurture deeper learning. Educators recognise that effective and active approaches to teaching are more closely associated with deeper learning. These active approaches aim to develop higher order skills, encouraging learners’ critical thinking and decision-making as well as enhancing their capacity to be agile, flexible and adaptable. Among those active approaches stand serious games, which are powerful learning environments that are seen as an emergent and engaging new way of experiment situations and construct knowledge. Serious games, in the form of role-play simulations, are scenario-based games that are used to simulate real life situations. Although serious games and simulations have been widely used in serving educational purposes, there is little evidence on their use in achieving deeper learning. In addition, there is lack of guidelines or a framework for designing serious games to support learners achieve deep learning. This paper proposes a theoretical framework, based on Bloom’s educational model for Mastery Learning, which illustrates the design of instructional process adapted for serious games using empathy and creativity as an approach of designing serious games for achieving deeper learning. It describes an approach of evaluating this framework by designing a serious game focusing on raising awareness about domestic violence and abuse. © 2018, Dechema e.V.

If the international experience incorporates serving others through a project of need, it is commonly believed that the students learn on a much deeper level than through the conventional learning approach of classroom lectures, homework problems, and tests. At Michigan Technological University, international community engagement (ICE) programs founded in engineering include an international senior (capstone) design program, a student chapter of Engineers Without Borders-USA, two Peace Corps Master's International programs, community-based participatory research programs, several social enterprises, an international sustainable development certificate, and many supportive classes. More than 500 students have participated in one or more of these programs in the last 15 years, and the vast majority of those surveyed have reported greater satisfaction with their education and a deeper learning experience compared to traditional on-campus learning.

Written discourse is arguably the primary class of data that can give us insights into deeper learning and higher order qualities such as critical thinking, argumentation, mastery of complex ideas, empathy, collaboration and interpersonal skills. Moreover, the ability to write in a scholarly manner is a core competence, often taking the form of discourse with oneself and the literature. Computational linguistics research has developed a rich array of tools for machine interpretation of human discourse, but work to develop these tools in the context of learning is at a relatively early stage. Moreover, there is a significant difference between designing tools to assist researchers in discourse analysis, and their deployment on platforms to provide meaningful analytics for the learners and educators who are conducting that discourse.

By providing both visual and haptic feedback, our application offers a multisensory experience to enhance the sense of embodiment. The user of our application should still feel their real limb attached to their bodies, and yet see their virtual avatar and interact with the virtual environment as an amputee. A simple task of handling and positioning objects in a table is proposed for users to experience the difficulties of having a missing arm. Additionally, experiment participants are asked to answer a self-presence questionnaire regarding their embodiment of the virtual avatar.

,,,,,,,,,,The influence of moral factors on bullying behaviors in adolescence: Theoretical considerations and proposal for a vr intervention to promote perspective-taking skills,"In the last decade, bullying and cyberbullying has known a rapid growth with worrisome consequences in regards to adolescent mental health. In the process of understanding the factors that influence bullying behaviours, researchers turned towards investigating moral factors, such as moral emotions, especially disgust and anger, and particularly a process called” moral disengagement” (MD; [22]). Moral disengagement is thought to contribute to the reason why some individuals, although they express disgust and anger in response to bullying behaviors, do not intervene in such situations. The objective of this research is to propose a VR based intervention aimed at increasing prosocial behaviour by improving perspective taking-skills and empathy concern. In the current paper, we suggest an interactive training simulation program where adolescent volunteers will take their own perspective or the perspective of the avatar in virtual reality, being instructed to try and understand its mental states. The situations encountered in VR are meant to trigger feelings of disgust, anger or elevation, the latter being an emotion elicited by witnessing acts of moral goodness. By increasing the propensity to take the perspective of the avatar, we aim to decrease the process of moral disengagement, especially in bullying and cyberbullying situations and increase prosocial behavior in adolescents. © 2020, National Defence University - Carol I Printing House.

This work uses the previously published StepKinnection game, which used skeletal tracking with a flat screen monitor, as a primary point of comparison for the proposed combination of these interaction modalities. Here, a Microsoft Kinect is used to track the player's skeleton and represent it as an avatar in the virtual environment while the HTC Vive is used for head tracking and virtual reality visualization. Multiple avatar positioning modes are trialled and discussed via a small self-reflective study (with the authors as participants) to examine their ability to allow accurate stepping motions, maintain physical comfort, and encourage self-identification or empathy with the avatar. While this is just an initial study, it highlights promising opportunities for designing engaging step training games with this integrated interface but also highlights its limitations, especially in the context of an unsupervised exercise program of older people in independent living situations. © 2018 IEEE.",,0,0,0,0,0,conferencePaper,2018,"Raffe, W.L.; Garcia, J.A.","2018 IEEE 6th International Conference on Serious Games and Applications for Health, SeGAH 2018",,,3TLVVUT9,10.1109/SeGAH.2018.8401371,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85050191845&doi=10.1109%2fSeGAH.2018.8401371&partnerID=40&md5=131e80406d278219c3234b216c481603,2018-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:37:39Z,2021-02-15T22:37:39Z,,1-7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 1</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,combining skeletal tracking and virtual reality for game-based fall prevention training for the elderly,combining skeletal tracking and virtual reality for gamebased fall prevention training for the elderly
,,,,,,,,,,The impact of interpersonal closeness cues in text-based healthcare chatbots on attachment bond and the desire to continue interacting: An experimental design,"Working alliance describes an important relationship quality between health professionals and patients and is robustly linked to treatment success. However, due to limited resources of health professionals, working alliance cannot always be promoted just-in-time in a ubiquitous fashion. To address this scalability problem, we investigate the direct effect of interpersonal closeness cues of text-based healthcare chatbots (THCBs) on attachment bond from the working alliance construct and the indirect effect on the desire to continue interacting with THCBs. The underlying research model and hypotheses are informed by counselling psychology and research on conversational agents. In order to investigate the hypothesized effects, we first develop a THCB codebook with 12 design dimensions on interpersonal closeness cues that are categorized into visual cues (i.e. avatar), verbal cues (i.e. greetings, address, jargon, T-V-distinction), quasi-nonverbal cues (i.e. emoticons) and relational cues (i.e. small talk, self-disclosure, empathy, humor, meta-relational talk and continuity). In a second step, four distinct THCB designs are developed along the continuum of interpersonal closeness (i.e. institutional-like, expert-like, peer-like and myself-like THCBs) and a corresponding study design for an interactive THCB-based online experiment is presented to test our hypotheses. We conclude this work-in-progress by outlining our future work. © 26th European Conference on Information Systems: Beyond Digitization - Facets of Socio-Technical Change, ECIS 2018.

,,,,,,,,,,A Learning System to Support Social and Empathy Disorders Diagnosis through Affective Avatars,"Nowadays diagnosis and treatment of cognitive and physical health issues can be empowered through the use of information technologies. However, there is a significant gap between the potential of those technologies and the real application. One example is the use of serious games with health proposals, a trending research area still not implanted in health systems. This paper proposes the use of serious games, particularly an interactive and affective avatar-based application to support the diagnosis and treatment of empathy and socialization issues, in an autonomous way through the implementation of a learning algorithm based on the ground truth obtained from the evaluation with real users, including normotypical users, users with Down syndrome and users with intellectual disability. © 2016 IEEE.",,0,0,0,0,0,conferencePaper,2017,"Hervas, R.; Johnson, E.; Franca, C.G.L.D.L.; Bravo, J.; Mondejar, T.","Proceedings - 2016 15th International Conference on Ubiquitous Computing and Communications and 2016 8th International Symposium on Cyberspace and Security, IUCC-CSS 2016",,,XZKKC2ST,10.1109/IUCC-CSS.2016.021,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85015234516&doi=10.1109%2fIUCC-CSS.2016.021&partnerID=40&md5=fdd98a86252b4919bd70a2d0688561f0,2017-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:37:40Z,2021-02-15T22:37:40Z,,93-100,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 1</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,a learning system to support social and empathy disorders diagnosis through affective avatars,a learning system to support social and empathy disorders diagnosis through affective avatars
,,,,,,,,,,Teaching human rights with video games?,"Serious games which deal with human rights topics have been on the rise for the last 15 years. Digital games show some unique properties that make them valuable for inducing social change. Some of the game elements that can be used to integrate values are as follows: Narration, which is one of the elements that is most obvious to players and is part of most of today's digital games, is a proper way of presenting human rights topics and can also include ideological messages. However, there are also other ways of creating empathy for certain groups as the example of Ayitii - The Cost of Life shows: If players feel responsible for the game characters, games can make players think about the topic presented. Being able to take meaningful decisions which influence the player's avatar, other non-playable characters, the narration or the game-world is a property of many recent games. Thus, ethical decisions are included in games and put players into the shoes of those who are oppressed or put in other situations where there is no easy way of deciding if something is right or wrong. Finally, the article also discusses if these serious games can affect players' real lives and change their way of thinking and attitudes. The serious game This War of Mine shows that some players think about their decisions and the topic of the game even after having stopped playing. However, there are also restrictions to transferring game contents into players' lives and induce social change. Quite often it is not enough just to play the game, teaching which must take place in a non-game context, is needed to make players aware of human rights (violations).",,0,0,0,0,0,conferencePaper,2017,"Gabriel, S.","Proceedings of the 11th European Conference on Games Based Learning, ECGBL 2017",,,SHUNPDXM,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85036477671&partnerID=40&md5=e512018f6f44da07a412436d7d2a07c4,2017-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:37:40Z,2021-02-15T22:37:40Z,,191-196,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 2</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,teaching human rights with video games?,teaching human rights with video games

The goal is develop a safe environment for social exploration and learning that boosts the child's confidence while providing calming mechanisms. Games increase children's motivation and thus increase the rate of learning in computer mediated environments. Furthermore, children with ASD are able to understand basic emotions and facial expressions in avatars more easily than in real-world interactions. © 2016 IEEE.",,0,0,0,0,0,conferencePaper,2016,"Hughes, D.E.; Vasquez, E.; Nicsinger, E.","2016 IEEE International Conference on Serious Games and Applications for Health, SeGAH 2016",,,8L8LQKUS,10.1109/SeGAH.2016.7586232,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84994711788&doi=10.1109%2fSeGAH.2016.7586232&partnerID=40&md5=bb23946086eb29ab2bf182f27c885055,2016-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:37:40Z,2021-02-15T22:37:40Z,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 6</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,improving perspective taking and empathy in children with autism spectrum disorder,improving perspective taking and empathy in children with autism spectrum disorder

Little is known about how to design such technologies to be adoptable, adaptable, useful, and feasible in everyday life. We report on the design process for TreatYoSelf, a smartphone application designed to improve medication adherence among youth living with HIV through reminders and positive reinforcement. Using participatory design, our aim was to understand factors related to adoption and acceptance of behavioral intervention technology as part of daily life. Two challenges of living with HIV led to an empathy-driven approach in our design process: (1) HIV is a stigmatized condition, which (2) disproportionately affects the marginalized populations of young African American men who have sex with men and transgender women. We discuss five empathy-driven design strategies: positive and nonjudgmental tone; minimal, avatar-based gamification; motivational and corny messages; nondisclosure through neutral signifiers; and social support through camaraderie. Our approach enabled us to identify and work through factors, often related to stigma and marginalization, which would lead to rejection of TreatYoSelf use in daily life. © 2016 EAI.",,0,0,0,0,0,conferencePaper,2016,"Marcu, G.; Dowshen, N.; Saha, S.; Sarreal, R.R.; Andalibi, N.",PervasiveHealth: Pervasive Computing Technologies for Healthcare,,,94KLMBT3,10.4108/eai.16-5-2016.2263336,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85046951092&doi=10.4108%2feai.16-5-2016.2263336&partnerID=40&md5=9c69c52491175e22e9a5c12cd82ac0f2,2016-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:37:41Z,2021-02-15T22:37:41Z,,,,,2016-May,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 11</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,treatyoself: empathy-driven behavioral intervention for marginalized youth living with hiv,treatyoself empathydriven behavioral intervention for marginalized youth living with hiv

This paper explores student team progress and responses to roadblocks while helping a maturing Silicon Valley start-up IMVU consider the role of avatars, creative expression and social interaction in the virtual world. Our goal was to seek a deep understanding of why users choose to spend their time and money to take part in the online community IMVU all the while creating a productive entrepreneurial team atmosphere. This paper explores the unique dynamics of the research team during the evolving investigation and delivery phase, all the while simultaneously examining the underlying emotions and motives of participants in one virtual community. We start with the belief that every new research team is like a start-up company and there are commonalities or differences between the student academic research environment and the company's organizational culture. Our collaborative research team includes members from areas of engineering, design, psychology, and communication. In this paper, we intend to correlate the factors that make the design team effective, utilize the findings to guide new student teams, and facilitate progress across the stages of the project. Two factors set the stage for insights on entrepreneuring: 1) evolving research team dynamics, and 2) the need-finding interactions with users both inside and outside the industry environment studied (IMVU). Surprising discoveries include a strong gender imbalance in the community as well as users reporting that online ""was basically real life."" A palette of stories abstractly parallels the student design team to the start-up they studied. Concepts include: self motivated, ambiguity readiness level, passion, and empathy. The team leader knowingly discussed using an open-process approach. Members noted a considerable lack of reluctance to prototype methods and team presentations; they also reported a deliberate lack of specific planning that they believe contributed to an entertaining and productive team ambiance.

We can say that these applications are entertaining games with non-entertainment goals. The idea is that games could be used for more serious purposes such as education, simulating real world phenomenon and relations in the world, increasing life quality through health, rehabilitation and therapy applications or raising interest in the problems in our global world. This paper focuses on psychology serious games. Generally, in psychology games users are represented by their avatar and can interact with the world and other game characters. Like in storytelling or bibliotherapy, the story itself has a therapeutic component so much as it evokes identification, empathy, resistance, opposition and disclosure of many confusing emotions. This goal oriented gaming can be used in goal oriented therapy methods. The game is played according to a scenario where the user can observe and react to different situations. This acts as a powerful tool for helping users understand and reflect on their own behavior and gives them the opportunity to learn from this virtual experience. The next stage is testing the user's new abilities with new situations by applying different games goals. The innovative use of computer in the form of psychotherapeutic games may enhance patient cooperation. This can also help to attract and sustain the interest especially in children. This paper describes the main features of serious games used in psychology based on the prototype of the game Mission - Master Your Fear. This is a serious game based on a specialist scenario founded on bibliotherapy with some therapeutic goals. It deals with issues and problems of preschool children.

User personality is deducted through two models, one based on raw audio and the other based on speech transcription text. Both models show good performance, with an average F-score of 69.6 for personality perception from audio, and an average F-score of 71.0 for recognition from text. Both models deploy a Convolutional Neural Network. Through a Human-Agent Interaction study we find correlations between user personality and preferred agent personality. The study suggests that especially the Openness user personality trait correlates with a stronger preference for agents with more gentle personality.

,,,,,,,,,,Using Facially Expressive Robots to Calibrate Clinical Pain Perception,"In this paper, we introduce a novel application of social robotics in healthcare: high fidelity, facially expressive, robotic patient simulators (RPSs), and explore their usage within a clinical experimental context. Current commercially-available RPSs, the most commonly used humanoid robots worldwide, are substantially limited in their usability and fidelity due to the fact that they lack one of the most important clinical interaction and diagnostic tools: an expressive face. Using autonomous facial synthesis techniques, we synthesized pain both on a humanoid robot and comparable virtual avatar. We conducted an experiment with 51 clinicians and 51 laypersons (n = 102), to explore differences in pain perception across the two groups, and also to explore the effects of embodiment (robot or avatar) on pain perception. Our results suggest that clinicians have lower overall accuracy in detecting synthesized pain in comparison to lay participants. We also found that all participants are overall less accurate detecting pain from a humanoid robot in comparison to a comparable virtual avatar, lending support to other recent findings in the HRI community. This research ultimately reveals new insights into the use of RPSs as a training tool for calibrating clinicians' pain detection skills.",,0,0,0,0,0,conferencePaper,2017,"Moosaei, Maryam; Das, Sumit K.; Popa, Dan O.; Riek, Laurel D.",PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2017 ACM/IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON HUMAN-ROBOT INTERACTION (HRI'17),978-1-4503-4336-7,,MVVPUT2U,10.1145/2909824.3020216,,2017-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-11T03:48:27Z,2021-02-11T03:48:27Z,,32-41,,,,,,,ACM IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction,,,,IEEE,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",English,,,,,,,Backup Publisher: Assoc Comp Machinery; IEEE; ACM SIGCHI; ACM SIGAI; IEEE Robot & Automat Soc; AAAI; HFES ISSN: 2167-2121 Type: Proceedings Paper,"<p>12th Annual ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), Vienna, AUSTRIA, MAR 06-09, 2017</p>",,,emotion; affective communication; social robots; facial expressions; humanoid robots; human robot interaction; health informatics; medical technologies; non-verbal communication; patient simulation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web of Science,using facially expressive robots to calibrate clinical pain perception,using facially expressive robots to calibrate clinical pain perception
,,,,,,,,,,Physiological Expression of Robots Enhancing Users' Emotion in Direct and Indirect Communication,"One of the important factors in medical and nursing care recently has been arousing the emotions of patients. Many types of communication robots and pet robots have been developed as communication partners for patients. The user's emotions are stimulated during direct communication with the robot, although there is less chance that the robot will approach the user in other situations such as watching TV and listening to music without disturbing him or her. The user feels that the robot is troublesome during the user's other tasks. The purpose of this research is to elevate the user's emotional experience through emotional expression by physiological expressions of a partner robot in the user's daily life. Ambient but emotional expressions of physiological phenomena are perceived by touch, even when the user is concentrating on other tasks. First, we focused on breathing, heartbeat and body temperature as the physiological phenomena. From the results of the evaluations of the robot's heartbeat and body temperature, along with our previous results for the breathing, each expression has arousal and pleasure axes of the robot's situation. In this paper, we focus on the joint attention of the robot and user to an emotional photograph, and we verified whether the strength of the user's own emotional response to the content was changed by the physiological expressions of the robot while they looked at photographs together. The results suggest that the physiological expression of the robot would make the common emotional experience of users the user's own emotion in the experience more excited and more relaxed.",,0,0,0,0,0,conferencePaper,2017,"Yoshida, Naoto; Yonezawa, Tomoko",PROCEEDINGS OF THE 5TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON HUMAN AGENT INTERACTION (HAI'17),978-1-4503-5113-3,,GP89Q5Y6,10.1145/3125739.3132609,,2017-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-11T03:48:27Z,2021-02-11T03:48:27Z,,505-509,,,,,,,,,,,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA",English,,,,,,,Backup Publisher: Assoc Comp Machinery Type: Proceedings Paper,"<p>5th International Conference on Human Agent Interaction (HAI), Excellence Ctr Cognit Interact Technol, Bielefeld, GERMANY, OCT 17-20, 2017</p>",,,empathy; emotional expressions; enhancing users' emotion; Physiological phenomena; stuffed-toy robot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web of Science,physiological expression of robots enhancing users' emotion in direct and indirect communication,physiological expression of robots enhancing users emotion in direct and indirect communication

In this paper we present experimental results on emotion recognition through the use of facial expression images obtained from the KDEF database, a fundamental first step towards the development of an empathic social robot. We compare the performance of Support Vector Machines (SVM) and a Multilayer Perceptron Network (MLP) on facial expression classification. We employ Gabor filters as an image pre-processing step before classification. Our SVM model achieves an accuracy rate of 97.08 %, whereas our MLP achieves 93.5%.

The work I have done and propose focuses on the role of affect in complex decision-making or judgment tasks where a pure utilitarian approach does not reflect human behavior. It is especially challenging to develop models that can predict choices made by an individual. However, as we approach having companion robots that have long-term relationships with a user, it becomes increasingly vital for the robot to be sensitive to the affect of the human and to behave in a manner that is consistent with the expectations of the user and society.

The project challenges the common assumption that robots need to appear human or animal-like to enable people to form connections with them. Our performative body-mapping (PBM) approach, in contrast, embraces the difference of machinic embodiment and places movement and its connection-making, knowledge-generating potential at the center of our social encounters.

In this work we provide a survey of three relevant human social disorders, namely autism, psychopathy and schizophrenia, as a means to gain a better understanding of social robots' future capability requirements. We provide evidence supporting the idea that social robots will require a combination of emotional intelligence and social intelligence, namely socio-emotional intelligence.

ZECA (Zeno Engaging Children with Autism) has a special skin covering its face which allows the display of facial expressions representing five emotions: joy, sadness, fear, anger, and surprise. These facial expressions were used in two different game scenarios, involving imitation and storytelling activities. The goal of these scenarios is to help the child acquire knowledge about different emotions and to improve their skill in recognizing them. The results show that these scenarios are appropriate for the goal established for this study, and positive behaviours concerning non-verbal communication were observed.

Young people, students, the higher educated, and men are more often found in the first two categories than in the third. The third attitudinal cluster is more skeptical when evaluating robots, while the first two clusters do not differ in their assessments, being equally appreciative. We evaluate critically the relevance of such survey-based classification for real-life decision situations, especially when people's answers about robots are not based on actual experiences of interaction with robots.

Korhonen et al. [2] state that the acceptance of a product depends not only on its utilitarian properties but also on non-utilitarian ones including playfulness. However, even if there seems to be near consensus on the importance of designing interactive systems beyond rational and functional requirements, the way in which this can be achieved is still an open research issue. In this paper we describe our design approach to develop an embodied and playful mobile interface to control a robot companion in a smart home environment. A major challenge of the research is to engage an older person in rich, empathic and playful interaction with a robot to encourage a prolonged, subtle, and stimulating effect beyond the initial encounter [3].

Social interaction and its expressive implications (e.g., emotional contagion, empathy) is an extremely relevant component for analysis of expressive gesture, since it provides significant information on the context expressive gestures are performed in. However, most of the current systems analyze expressive gestures according to basic emotion categories or simple dimensional approaches. Moreover, almost all of them are intended for a single user, whereas social interaction is often neglected. After briefly recalling our pioneering studies on collaborative robot-human interaction, this paper presents two steps in the direction of novel computational models and techniques for measuring social interaction: (i) the interactive installation Mappe per Affetti Erranti for active listening to sound and music content, and (ii) the techniques we developed for explicitly measuring synchronization within a group of users.

There is also a growing awareness of the importance of inclusive education and, as a consequence, the need to comply with accessibility requirements regarding web contents and web interface (WCAG). These requirements are also supported by specific laws in most countries. But such awareness does not yet reach the interfaces of conversational agents or chatbots that are being developed. Within the framework of the European project ACACIA, co-funded by the Erasmus+ program of the European Union, Artemisa, a chatbot has been created dedicated to fight against sexual harassment and search for volunteers to promote the acceptance of diversity and tolerance, has been created using a platform that facilitates the generation and management of this type of artificial intelligences. But to what extent Artemisa is an accessible chatbot or not? Is it ethically acceptable to make use of a tool that is intended to support inclusiveness but presents accessibility barriers to some users? What is the current state in terms of accessibility compliance of chatbots that work on social networks? This article seeks to answer this and other questions related to accessibility in Chatbots, conversational agents and virtual assistant's.

A Study of Verbal Abuse Types and Conversational Agents' Response Styles,"Verbal abuse is a hostile form of communication ill-intended to harm the other person. With a plethora of AI solutions around, the other person being targeted may be a conversational agent. In this study, involving 3 verbal abuse types (Insult, Threat, Swearing) and 3 response styles (Avoidance, Empathy, Counterattacking), we examine whether a conversational agent's response style under varying abuse types influences those emotions found to mitigate people's aggressive behaviors. Sixty-four participants, assigned to one of the abuse type conditions, interacted with the three conversational agents in turn and reported their feelings about guiltiness, anger, and shame after each session. Our study results show that, regardless of the abuse type, the agent's response style has a significant effect on user emotions. Participants were less angry and more guilty with the empathetic agent than the other two agents.

,,,,,,,,,,STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS “DESIGN THINKING” IN ENGINEERING CURRICULUM,"It is suggested by many scholars that if the goal of engineering education is to produce engineers who can critically design and create, then providing students with early opportunities to engage in creative engineering design is important. While basic design is focused on the development of new products for the individual, working towards a more sustainable world demands greater attention to designing for and with communities. Improving design education and examining design-learning outcomes requires a kind of targeted approach that could match the best practices to personalize student learning. Design is complex and design includes balancing the needs of multiple stakeholders. However, there is a gap in the preparation of design education that will be needed in a challenging environment. This paper reviews the history of design thinking in the engineering curriculum. Design thinking education starts with an understanding of its importance with socioeconomic relevance. Through observation and empathy, mapping the designer uses the listening and learning tools for mapping users unarticulated needs, working in a team environment. The designer takes time to think carefully why a certain project is considered and details which aspects of machine learning application can be applied from functional to complete success for the end users. The availability of powerful virtual reality methodologies, have made it possible to consider the realistic needs and visualize scenarios and to explore the design alternatives with new ideas before full scale resource allocation on new ideas. Mid-to-advanced level courses with experimental assignments require that students apply through experimentation the principles and concepts learned in foundation courses. The basic design tools such as axiomatic thinking, theory of inventive problem solving, design iteration and simulation using hardware-in-the loop are discussed with case studies. Consideration of product sustainability with the thoughts of design for disassembly and disposal has emerged as a major part of design thinking. Senior engineering courses center on cross and interdisciplinary design and capstone experiences so that students experience fully guided practice of device design and problem solving, simulating what they are likely to experience in the world. This paper examines the critical issues of design thinking in a curriculum from observation, empathy mapping, validation of the idea, and improvement of idea by virtual reality and machine learning, optimization of the idea by tools such as axiomatic design, hardware in the loop simulation, and finally examining product sustainability causes.",,0,0,0,0,0,conferencePaper,2019,"Shetty, Devdas; Xu, Jiajun","PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME INTERNATIONAL MECHANICAL ENGINEERING CONGRESS AND EXPOSITION, 2018, VOL 5",978-0-7918-5206-4,,ULBB6B72,,,2019-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-11T04:02:21Z,2021-02-11T04:02:21Z,,,,,,,,,,,,,AMER SOC MECHANICAL ENGINEERS,"THREE PARK AVENUE, NEW YORK, NY 10016-5990 USA",English,,,,,,,Backup Publisher: Amer Soc Mech Engineers Type: Proceedings Paper,"<p>ASMEInternational Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition (IMECE2018), Pittsburgh, PA, NOV 09-15, 2018</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web of Science,strategies to address “design thinking” in engineering curriculum,strategies to address design thinking in engineering curriculum

In the present study, we introduced a haptic-based biofeedback (BF) system designed to augment foot pressure information with a wearable vibrotactile BF device attached to the pelvis. This device provided information regarding an older adult's foot pressure pattern to the person (trainee) and coach (trainer) to refine the interpersonal feedback. In this project, a feasibility laboratory study was first conducted to clarify the validity of the BF system (i.e., kinematic changes and cognitive burden of the device). Our preliminary study showed that the system had potential to modify the kinematic pattern in some older adults, but not walking speed (comprehensive evaluation of walking). Moreover, it is likely that the device required, to some extent, a cognitive burden for specific older people; thus, this aspect may have interfered with the usability of the BF in the initial practice phase.

This new revolution brings new paradigms that is breaking the way men work, and, consequently, changes in their training will also be necessary due to differences in knowledge and skills needed to meet new job demands. A fundamental characteristic of this new mode of production is multidisciplinary teams with a high level of technical knowledge and the ability to face several aspects of the production system, from production line up to customer interaction and integration with business and corporative systems. Besides, due to the velocity of transformations, the new employees must be able to learn and change quickly. Furthermore, such workers must develop intrinsically human characteristics like empathy, personal relationship and technical skills that machines won't be able to do, since all other activities would be done by machines with artificial intelligence and advanced robotics.

The aim of the study is to explore students' opinions about the process of study quality assurance at the Daugavpils University (further - DU), Latvia. The participants of this study were 60 students from 12 master and doctoral study programs at DU. The analysis of structured interviews with the students made it possible to identify the typical characteristic features of DU internal quality assessment. The research showed that students assess highly lecturers' personal qualities (attitude to their profession, personal interest in students' success, empathy, striving for cooperation) and their professional qualities (knowledge of the subject, didactic and communicative competence, and ability to get the feedback from students as well). To promote the cooperation between the students and the academic staff of DU, it is useful to practice trans-disciplinary out-of-study forms. Summer schools for students studying in master and doctoral programs encourage students to think about the future of civilization, about a sustainable and unsustainable behaviour on a local and global scale, goals of a sustainable development and awareness about them, and also about the role of a qualitative education content and study environment for achieving these goals.

Ethnographic research and participatory design methods were part of a collaborative process aimed at empowering students in creating a sustainable community for the residents of Tilaco, Mexico. Student teams discovered the real needs of the community through ethnographic research, and were involved in daily activities of the community, the important events, and the festivities. This built deep empathy with the people with whom students were designing, getting to understand who they are, what they do, what they think and feel. The attitude was about understanding the emotional needs of the users. In conjunction with the ethnographic information determined during the discovery phase, students applied participatory design methods throughout the process, beginning with activities that helped community members create a vision for their development. Students adapted participatory methods to all the phases of the design process, which were implemented through community workshops. These workshops helped to address complexities, empower community, and balance the need to preserve natural/cultural resources.

Natural language processing techniques presume that in common most of the user annotations are written in English dialect, but as focus shifts onto processing comments from internet sources such as microblogging services, this becomes progressively harder to guarantee. Conveying the empathy in their own language can be well thought-out as the homey means for expressing the exact opinion and it leads to the generation of multilinguistic societal data.

,,,,,,,,,,Towards an Unsupervised Entrainment Distance in Conversational Speech using Deep Neural Networks,"Entrainment is a known adaptation mechanism that causes interaction participants to adapt or synchronize their acoustic characteristics. Understanding how interlocutors tend to adapt to each other's speaking style through entrainment involves measuring a range of acoustic features and comparing those via multiple signal comparison methods. In this work, we present a turn-level distance measure obtained in an unsupervised manner using a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model, which we call Neural Entrainment Distance (NED). This metric establishes a framework that learns an embedding from the population wide entrainment in an unlabeled training corpus. We use the framework for a set of acoustic features and validate the measure experimentally by showing its efficacy in distinguishing real conversations from fake ones created by randomly shuffling speaker turns. Moreover, we show real world evidence of the validity of the proposed measure. We find that high value of NED is associated with high ratings of emotional bond in suicide assessment interviews, which is consistent with prior studies.",,0,0,0,0,0,conferencePaper,2018,"Nasir, Md; Baucom, Brian; Narayanan, Shrikanth; Georgiou, Panayiotis","19TH ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE INTERNATIONAL SPEECH COMMUNICATION ASSOCIATION (INTERSPEECH 2018), VOLS 1-6: SPEECH RESEARCH FOR EMERGING MARKETS IN MULTILINGUAL SOCIETIES",978-1-5108-7221-9,,BUIRGCD2,10.21437/Interspeech.2018-1395,,2018-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-11T04:12:12Z,2021-02-11T04:12:12Z,,3423-3427,,,,,,,Interspeech,,,,ISCA-INT SPEECH COMMUNICATION ASSOC,"C/O EMMANUELLE FOXONET, 4 RUE DES FAUVETTES, LIEU DIT LOUS TOURILS, BAIXAS, F-66390, FRANCE",English,,,,,,,Backup Publisher: Int Speech Commun Assoc ISSN: 2308-457X Type: Proceedings Paper,"<p>19th Annual Conference of the International-Speech-Communication-Association (INTERSPEECH 2018), Hyderabad, INDIA, AUG 02-SEP 06, 2018</p>",,,behavioral analysis; conversational speech; deep neural network; embeddings; entrainment; unsupervised learning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web of Science,towards an unsupervised entrainment distance in conversational speech using deep neural networks,towards an unsupervised entrainment distance in conversational speech using deep neural networks
,,,,,,,,,,A CASE STUDY OF OPEN-LOOP DESIGN THINKING CURRICULUM TO BRING UP MORE INNOVATION OUTCOMES AND FOSTER INNOVATION ABILITY,"Serving as an important district for education and technology in Xi'an, China, Beilin district accommodates 17 universities in the area, with 30 thousand teaching and research personnel as well as a total enrollment of 173.5 thousand students. Enterprises, universities and governments in Beilin are facing with a widespread challenge in the world. Provided particular educational and industry resources, the challenge is to find a practice which is potentially valuable for teaching corporations to improve innovation products, ideas, organizational outcomes related to innovation and explore more innovation outcomes to support the development of economics. In view of this, redefining new multidisciplinary learning to stay abreast of change is in urgent need. Consequently, “design thinking” has generated significant attention in the innovation press and has been heralded as a novel problem-solving methodology well suited to the often-cited challenges different organizations face in encouraging innovation and growth. This paper deals with a project proposing to gradually change the quality and quantity of innovation outcomes in Beilin. Through the combination of online live design thinking courses provided by an American educational institution together with representatives from public agencies and private organizations, an open-loop design thinking curriculum was designed for what has been named as “ Design Talents “ Program. 12 teachers including 2 instructors from American Alliance for International Education teaching design thinking process, 2 teaching assistants (associate professor in the field of design) from China and 8 representatives with technical skills got involved in the maker practice process, assuring that students can acquire a range of capacities during their training. With ages ranging from 19 to 41, a selected group of totally 68 students and representatives from different majors in 14 universities at Beilin District, Xi'an, participated in the first phase training. The results presented, a total of 14 innovation projects were proposed from the training, 3 of which have been set out to break into the market, and 2 of which gained second prize of start-up competition. According to the investigation and deep interview after the training, not only those efficiency and productivity were realized, but also creative confidence, empathy, communication and collaboration, as well as creative behaviors have been fostered.

,,,,,,,,,,QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS OF EXPECTATIONS OF MEDICAL STUDENTS ON THEIR PARTICIPATION IN AN INNOVATION ACTIVITY COMBINING FORMAL DEBATE WITH FLIPPED CLASSROOM,"The traditional classroom lecture is still commonly used in undergraduate medical education. However, classroom lectures can be considered teacher-centered strategies that are conducive to passive learning on behalf of learners. For this reason, there are calls for a shift in medical education away from the traditional lecture approach and toward other instructional approaches that encourage higher-order thinking and active participation from students. One such approach that has received much attention is the flipped classroom, which allows students to independently learn foundational concepts as required homework, and then use this gained knowledge during class time to engage in critical thinking opportunities and application of knowledge. In the flipped classroom model, learners are first exposed to educational content prior to formal class sessions via readings, videos, or other electronic exercises that have been formally assigned. Given that students have already acquired knowledge through this initial phase, the subsequent classroom time is dedicated to activities that allow students to apply their knowledge to challenging problems in a setting that promotes collaboration with peers and feedback and direction from professors. In addition, using formal debate in higher education appears to be a useful tool to prepare students to face the complexity of issues affecting the modern world and to work with individuals with different viewpoints and backgrounds. In fact, using formal debate in higher education has been associated with improving communication and empathy, critical-thinking ability, literature searching, and application of evidence, teamwork, and self-directed learning. Debates allow students an opportunity not only to identify that there is an issue to resolve, but also to demonstrate a deeper analysis of the issue, including appraisal, critique, and reasoning of the issue for a potential solution. Flipped classroom together with formal debate were proposed to medical students as innovative methodologies to improve communication skills and critical thinking in response to the demand to have future biomedical professionals better trained in these areas. The general aim of the innovation experience was to encourage the active participation of students in the construction of knowledge, as well as to develop didactic strategies for their autonomous learning and to design active processes of acquisition of skills and abilities for their professional performance. Here, we report the expectations of medical students from Complutense University of Madrid on their future participation in the afore-mentioned innovation activity. Participants considered that the experience would help them gain confidence and security when it comes to presenting scientific facts, be fluent when talking in public, and expand their knowledge on some controversial topics. Regarding the negative aspects, some showed concern about being sufficiently prepared to carry out the activity with guaranteed success, taking into account that for a significant part of the students it was the first time that they participated in an innovative activity that combined both flipped learning and formal debate.",,0,0,0,0,0,conferencePaper,2018,"Paredes, S.

,,,,,,,,,,Cross-functional Teams That Grok It: The Collective Empathic Understanding of Product Requirements,"Software development has become increasingly software `product' development, without the authoritative `customer' stakeholder role that many requirements engineering processes assume exists in some form. Many progressive software product companies today are empowering cross-functional product teams to own their product to collectively understand the product context, the true product needs, and manage its on-going evolution. Some teams do this better than others and neither established requirements elicitation and validation processes nor conventional team leadership practices explain the reasons for the differences. This research inquires into how cross-functional product teams, as a collective, create and nurture a shared mental model that accurately represents the external product domain and its realities. The research also examines how teams use that collective understanding to shape development plans, internal and external communications, new team member onboarding, etc. The aim of this research is to develop substantive theory that describes how self-directed, cross-functional product development teams take an empathic-based approach to discovering, understanding, and maintaining a deep, collective understanding of the domain and true product needs.

,,,,,,,,,,THE CLASS TEACHER AND THE QUALITY OF PUPILS' LIFE,"The aim of the paper is to discuss a specific semi-professional group - class teachers and their professional, social and personal competences. We were focusing on the concept of interaction among participants in the educational and learning process. We set the following research questions: In which areas can a class teacher influence the quality of pupils' life? What interventions can a class teacher implement to improve the quality of pupils' life? Who can a class teacher cooperate with in this effort and in which educational processes? A qualitative research approach was chosen for the research study. The data was obtained by a deep semi-structured interview. We focused not on how individuals understand and interpret their experience as a class teacher. The analysis of the interviews shows not only what the class teachers considered to be obvious and commonplace, but also what is very challenging and struggling in their work. Class teacher is involved in a complex network of social relationships. Besides personal identity, it is just social identity, i.e. awareness of belonging to a particular social group, sharing and empathy, which are important for communication and relationships. Symmetrical communication is undoubtedly the necessary condition for effective cooperation. The opportunity to overcome stereotypes and categorizations is being created in joint actions. Teachers take care of continuity, proximity and consistency with both children and parents. They emotionally put more into relationships, and they are more interested in good mutual relations. Teachers often tend to be more sympathetic, emphasizing children's needs and harmonious interaction.",,0,0,0,0,0,conferencePaper,2018,"Loudova, Irena; Novotna, Jana",EDULEARN18: 10TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON EDUCATION AND NEW LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES,978-84-09-02709-5,,5BE4Q7BQ,,,2018-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-11T04:12:16Z,2021-02-11T04:12:16Z,,3649-3656,,,,,,,EDULEARN Proceedings,,,,IATED-INT ASSOC TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION & DEVELOPMENT,"LAURI VOLPI 6, VALENICA, BURJASSOT 46100, SPAIN",English,,,,,,,ISSN: 2340-1117 Type: Proceedings Paper,"<p>10th International Conference on Education and New Learning Technologies (EDULEARN), Palma, SPAIN, JUL 02-04, 2018</p>",,,Class teacher; personal identity; quality of pupils' life; social identity; symmetrical communication,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web of Science,the class teacher and the quality of pupils' life,the class teacher and the quality of pupils life
,,,,,,,,,,APPLICATION OF FORMATIVE ASSESSMENT FOR THE ENHANCED FOREIGN LANGUAGE LEARNING,"Education of the 21st century has been strongly focused on the development of the fundamental universal skills such as critical and creative thinking, problem-solving, global empathy, tolerance, intercultural awareness as well as team-work and collaboration. Formative assessment (FA) has emerged to be one of the efficient tools in the development of the above-mentioned competences and thus a topical issue in today's education. A number of studies have produced positive results investigating the use of formative assessment on the development of learner metacognitive and affective skills, student responsibility, active self-regulated learning, viewing learning as a goal rather than an outcome (Anderson, M., 2016; Brookhart, 2009; Chappuis, J., 2016; Fisher & Frey, 2014; [13]). The present study intends to examine the application of formative assessment in language classes at a higher education institution whose mission is to educate citizens for our society through commitment to liberal arts and sciences education. It aims at investigating how the application of formative assessment assists in fostering deep learning, student-centered approach, collaborative and tension free environment, active learning in small groups, enhanced dynamic exchange of feedback between teachers and students as well as self-assessment and peer-assessment both in traditional classroom as well as in virtual learning environment. It also explores the impact of formative assessment upon student lifelong learning skill development. Methodologically, the study is based on an opinion survey, reflection and class observation performed with 181 university students and 21 language teachers. The study has revealed that formative assessment adds significant value to the learning and teaching of languages. It settles very well in the education process based on liberal arts and sciences grounded in the principles of collegiality, cooperative learning, connection-building among all members of the learning and teaching process including students and teachers. It has also shown that the broad possibilities for the successful exploitation of formative assessment in language education are still in need of further in-depth research.",,0,0,0,0,0,conferencePaper,2018,"Macianskiene, Nemira; Bijeikiene, Vilma",EDULEARN18: 10TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON EDUCATION AND NEW LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES,978-84-09-02709-5,,BW9SNJHH,,,2018-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-11T04:12:17Z,2021-02-11T04:12:17Z,,10084-10091,,,,,,,EDULEARN Proceedings,,,,IATED-INT ASSOC TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION & DEVELOPMENT,"LAURI VOLPI 6, VALENICA, BURJASSOT 46100, SPAIN",English,,,,,,,ISSN: 2340-1117 Type: Proceedings Paper,"<p>10th International Conference on Education and New Learning Technologies (EDULEARN), Palma, SPAIN, JUL 02-04, 2018</p>",,,foreign language learning and teaching; Formative assessment; student-centered approach; tertiary education,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web of Science,application of formative assessment for the enhanced foreign language learning,application of formative assessment for the enhanced foreign language learning

,,,,,,,,,,"Developing Competence, Conscience, and Compassion through Reflective Pedagogy","This paper outlines how Reflective Pedagogy contributes to the development of students' holistic learning by developing their competence, conscience, and compassion in Speaking class. The application of Reflective Pedagogy, which sets out a learning cycle from context understanding to evaluation, and the employment of student-focused topics allow a more holistic learning process to take place. Giving students more opportunity to experience a full cycle of learning from planning to performance results in a deeper level of learning. Furthermore, trusting students with the responsibility in the conduct of their learning course, provided with appropriate approach and structured monitoring, leads to a more thorough development. Utilizing self-evaluation and peer-evaluation rubrics is a way to sharpen the students' cognitive awareness, whereas self-reflection and peer-feedback forms enable them to develop their conscience by exercising their empathy towards themselves and others as well as to reinforce their compassion by accepting and giving assistance to their peers. Furthermore, a recorded speech performance enables students to reflect and evaluate themselves and become essential to raise the students' awareness of their strengths and needs.

In this course, students having various backgrounds in arts and engineering schools participates and forms several interdisciplinary teams for project-based learning. The systematic methods such as Design Thinking Process and Strategic Foresight and Innovation have been combinatorially adopted for this course.

The theory and methodology of the curriculum, instruction and evaluation require certain skills from teachers, such as: a great interest in the adequacy of the training process to the needs of each individual, the ability to adjust to different situations, a holistic assessment of the students performance, the involvement of the students in the learning process, etc. These skills are equally indispensable for the teacher of Religion, who must have greater sensitivity and empathy, and also deep religious convictions, reflected in their behaviour and in their way of relating with the student.

,,,,,,,,,,THE HIGH QUALITY BUSINESS SCHOOL ACADEMIC TEACHER OF THE 21ST CENTURY - POLISH STUDENTS' PERSPECTIVE,"The literature shows that the success and competence of future managers depend on the quality of their academic teachers. Moreover high quality study requires high quality lecturing/teaching that creates an environment in which deep learning outcomes are made possible for students. The aim was to identify the characteristics of the academic teacher working at business schools, according to the expectations of Polish students from a 21st century perspective. A qualitative survey design was used in the form of a letter questionnaire. 144 second-year bachelor students of Gdansk University from the Faculty of Management were asked to list a maximum of five, most preferred characteristics, and to comment their answers. Finally, 109 students participated in the study, and 471 characteristics were proposed, analyzed and put into five categories, like: tangibles (T), reliability (Rel), responsiveness (Res), assurance (A) and empathy (E). Content analysis and Pareto-Lorenzo analysis was used and the most preferable characteristics were identified. The conclusions, proposals and recommendations were presented. The academic teacher has to be well prepared and teach in an interesting, innovative way with a use of modern techniques and methods. Very important is to apply not only the lecture-style methods but also on-the job teaching, project-based teaching, team work-based teaching, action teaching, experiential teaching, small groups teaching, case studies, simulations, e-teaching, and even volunteering teaching. Nor without the signifcance are coaching and mentoring and the features referring to the style of teaching, like charisma, creativity, passion, and engagement, which characterise good managers and business leaders.",,0,0,0,0,0,conferencePaper,2014,"Wisniewska, Malgorzata; Grudowski, Piotr",NEW CHALLENGES OF ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT - 2014,978-9984-45-836-6,,AMDJNKC3,,,2014-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-11T04:12:31Z,2021-02-11T04:12:31Z,,431-438,,,,,,,,,,,UNIV LATVIA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",English,,,,,,,"Backup Publisher: Univ Latvia, Fac Econ & Management; Latvian European Community Studies Assoc; Inst CEDIMES Lettonie; Econometrists Assoc Latvia; Latvian Informat & Commun Technol Assoc; Assoc Statisticians Latvia; Balt Sea Reg Univ Network; Wellton Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>International Scientific Conference on New Challenges of Economic and Business Development, Univ Latvia, Riga, LATVIA, MAY 08-10, 2014</p>",,,academic teacher; business school; quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web of Science,the high quality business school academic teacher of the 21st century - polish students' perspective,the high quality business school academic teacher of the 21st century polish students perspective

Cognitive empathy is defined as the ability for deliberate intellectual perspective taking of another person in a teaching-learning situation. Using case studies, we identified prospective primary teachers in a methods course using a 2-by-2 matrix based on their cognitive empathy and mathematical knowledge for teaching. We found that although in general prospective teachers are empathetic in nature, most of them are able to relate to struggling students from an affective aspect, and rarely from a cognitive stance.

We hypothesize that such an illusion of virtual body ownership (IVBO) has a particularly high, yet overlooked potential for nonhumanoid avatars. To validate our claim, we use the example of three very different creatures-a scorpion, a rhino, and a bird-to explore possible avatar controls and game mechanics based on specific animal abilities. A quantitative evaluation underpins the high game enjoyment arising from embodying such nonhuman morphologies, including additional body parts and obtaining respective superhuman skills, which allows us to derive a set of novel design implications. Furthermore, the experiment reveals a correlation between IVBO and game enjoyment, which is a further indication that nonhumanoid creatures offer a meaningful design space for VR games worth further investigation.",,0,0,0,0,0,conferencePaper,2019,"Krekhov, Andrey; Cmentowski, Sebastian; Emmerich, Katharina; Krueger, Jens",CHI PLAY'19: PROCEEDINGS OF THE ANNUAL SYMPOSIUM ON COMPUTER-HUMAN INTERACTION IN PLAY,978-1-4503-6688-5,,6ECVWIMH,10.1145/3311350.3347172,,2019-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-11T04:15:46Z,2021-02-11T04:15:46Z,,439-451,,,,,,,,,,,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA",English,,,,,,,Backup Publisher: ACM SIGCHI; Assoc Comp Machinery Type: Proceedings Paper,"<p>6th ACM SIGCHI Annual Symposium on Computer-Human Interaction in Play (CHI PLAY), Barcelona, SPAIN, OCT 22-25, 2019</p>",,,Animal avatars; animal embodiment; avatar control; IVBO; virtual creatures; virtual reality games,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web of Science,beyond human: animals as an escape from stereotype avatars in virtual reality games,beyond human animals as an escape from stereotype avatars in virtual reality games
,,,,,,,,,,"A Computerized, Gamified Intervention Training Visual Perspective-Taking. Theoretical Rationale and Proposal of a Randomized Controlled Trial","Perspective-taking is a core theory of mind process, entailing the ability to understand and predict others' mental states. While the literature suggests that priming a perspective-taking stance increases empathic concern and intergroup cohesion and reduces implicit negative attitudes such as racial bias and prejudice, no study up to date has attempted to foster perspective-taking implicitly, by training visual perspective-taking in a computerized task. In the current paper, we propose a computerized, gamified intervention for visual perspective-taking in adolescents and young adults. The intervention is an adapted version of extant visual perspective-taking assessment protocols and is envisioned to train participants to selectively attend to the visual perspective of an animated avatar, instead of their own. By training an allocentric bias, the intervention aims to increase empathic and theory of mind abilities and to foster interpersonal communication and cohesion. An additionally hypothesized benefit of the intervention is a decrease in self-focused attention, a marker of social anxiety disorder. As such, the intervention is suited to address two different, but inter-related needs: optimizing social functioning and managing social anxiety symptomatology. Introducing users to gamification elements, such as earning badges, advancing through increasing difficulty levels, receiving feedback and leaderboards highlighting achievements, is intended to increase the intervention's efficacy and to promote adherence. Design considerations for testing the intervention in an experimental trial will additionally be proposed, with the intervention contrasted against a sham control condition that will equally train egocentric and allocentric biases in visual perspective-taking. Theoretical and practical implications for educational settings will be discussed.",,0,0,0,0,0,conferencePaper,2019,"Cosmoiu, Ana Maria; Nedelcea, Catalin; Podina, Ioana Roxana","NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND REDESIGNING LEARNING SPACES, VOL I",,,5UY52ESC,10.12753/2066-026X-19-011,,2019-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-11T04:15:47Z,2021-02-11T04:15:47Z,,91-97,,,,,,,eLearning and Software for Education,,,,CAROL I NATL DEFENCE UNIV PUBLISHING HOUSE,"PANDURI ST, 68-72, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",English,,,,,,,Backup Publisher: European Secur & Def Coll; Romania Partnership Ctr; Natl Def Univ Carol I ISSN: 2066-026X Type: Proceedings Paper,"<p>15th International Scientific Conference on eLearning and Software for Education (eLSE) - New Technologies and Redesigning Learning Spaces, Bucharest, ROMANIA, APR 11-12, 2019</p>",,,perspective-taking; theory of mind; computerized; gamification; training,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web of Science,"a computerized, gamified intervention training visual perspective-taking. theoretical rationale and proposal of a randomized controlled trial",a computerized gamified intervention training visual perspectivetaking theoretical rationale and proposal of a randomized controlled trial
,,,,,,,,,,A CASE STUDY ON DELIVERING VIRTUAL REALITY LEARNING FOR CHILDREN WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER USING VIRTUAL REALITY HEADSETS,"Previous research studies have shown that virtual reality (VR) learning is effective for various topics of learning (e.g., social adaptation and skills, job interview, empathy, etc.) on the autism spectrum disorder (ASD) population. VR learning is always delivered using VR devices or installations. Compared to VR installations such as Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE), with the careful design of VR software, VR headsets can achieve a similar degree of immersion and interactivity at a fraction of the cost, while keeping the whole setup highly portable and requirements on the venue space at a minimum. However, there is a lack of research on delivering VR learning for the ASD population using VR headsets. In this paper, we report a case study involving four children with ASD, who were recruited to experience the prototype software for VR learning in our laboratory environment. Our observation reveals that the design allows children with ASD comprehend the threedimensional world and interact with virtual objects and avatars smoothly while using the VR headsets.",,0,0,0,0,0,conferencePaper,2018,"Li, Chen; Yuan, Vanessa S.

,,,,,,,,,,REALITY VS VIRTUAL REALITY: AFFECTIVE DOMAIN LEARNING OUTCOMES IN MEDICAL ANATOMY TEACHING,"Even after 43 years of anatomy teaching I continue to be deeply moved whenever I view a cadaver or hold a heart or brain in my hand. New teaching methodologies are increasingly using virtual world teaching, interactive models, educational games and Avatars. Through this wave of virtual reality education are important affective domain learning outcomes at risk? During the mid to late 1900s, Bloom and his colleagues recognised that learning could be divided into three categories or domains; cognitive (knowledge), affective (attitude) and psychomotor (skills). The highest level of affective domain learning outcomes involve the “development in one's personal and civic life a code of behaviour based on ethical principles consistent with democratic ideals”.(1) Domains of professionalism in relation to medical practice include ethical practice, reflection/self-awareness, responsibility for actions, respect for patients, teamwork and social responsibility.(2) So, what is the impact of studying anatomy through dissection? In answering this question, most anatomists and students will talk about the value in learning anatomy and of understanding function. While this is true, I believe it goes far beyond this simplistic view. Studying the human body or cadaver can be an emotional experience, sharing the grief of the family following the death of the person they loved as well as a source of wonder at the beauty and perfection of the human body. We are reminded of how much we take life for granted as we go about our day to day activities. In other words, it puts life into perspective. Medical training all too often remains grounded in the biomedical model, with the cognitive domain overshadowing the psychosocial development and needs of learners.(3) Some of the unique aspects of cadaveric dissection include the realistic nature of this teaching medium that allows students to grasp a clear visuo-spatial picture of the organization of human body, experience the texture of human tissues, witness and comprehend pathological conditions while learning the normal and compare the normal vs pathological.(4) Student views range from “enhances my respect for the human body” to “makes learning of anatomy more interesting”. Our results suggest that the more thorough, enduring and contextual learning experience provided by cadaveric dissections are better appreciated in clinical workplaces where the knowledge could be applied to clinical situations. This paper presents an overview of current views regarding affective domain learning outcomes and anatomy teaching methodologies. It highlights the likely importance of the use of human body parts and of dissection in the development of various domains of professionalism in relation to medical practice. As educators should we be more mindful of what learning outcomes might be threatened through replacing reality with virtual reality?",,0,0,0,0,0,conferencePaper,2017,"Tedman, Raymond",9TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON EDUCATION AND NEW LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES (EDULEARN17),978-84-697-3777-4,,FVBPEAVU,,,2017-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-11T04:15:51Z,2021-02-11T04:15:51Z,,7502-7511,,,,,,,EDULEARN Proceedings,,,,IATED-INT ASSOC TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION & DEVELOPMENT,"LAURI VOLPI 6, VALENICA, BURJASSOT 46100, SPAIN",English,,,,,,,ISSN: 2340-1117 Type: Proceedings Paper,"<p>9th International Conference on Education and New Learning Technologies (EDULEARN), Barcelona, SPAIN, JUL 03-05, 2017</p>",,,empathy; virtual reality; professionalism; affective domain; Anatomy; dissection; humanising,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web of Science,reality vs virtual reality: affective domain learning outcomes in medical anatomy teaching,reality vs virtual reality affective domain learning outcomes in medical anatomy teaching

In this case, we aim to use an assistive technology in the shape of an affective avatar to help people who have been diagnosed with different forms of Social Communications Disorders (SCD). The designed avatar presents a humanoid face that displays emotions with a subtlety akin to that of real life human emotions, with those emotions changing according to the interactions that the user chooses to perform on the avatar. We have used Blender for the design of the emotions, which are happiness, sadness, surprise, fear and anger, plus a neutral emotion, while Unity was used to dictate the behavior of the avatar when the interactions were performed, which could be positive (caress), negative (poke) or neutral (wait). The avatar has been evaluated by 48 people from different backgrounds and the results show the overall positive reception by the users, as well as the difference between neurotypical and non-neurotypical users in terms of emotion recognition and chosen interactions.

The prototype of the game from which this study started has been developed by the University of Salerno and is aimed at assessing the age at which students develop perspective-taking and mental rotation skills. The shift from the scope of measurement to that of training required the software to be capable to adaptively suggest effective strategies appropriate to the user's profile. Notwithstanding the theoretical framework and the approach to the representation of spatial reference systems, the specific educational needs have led to a complete re-design of the application and to the introduction of a semantic layer that can adaptively support user.

,,,,,,,,,,Open Process for Entrepreneuring Team Collaboration: Story Parallels from an Academic Design Team to the Studied Start-Up,"Increasingly, student entrepreneurial ventures begin as emotional connections, artistic experiences, and expectations for delivering on research teams. This paper explores student team progress and responses to roadblocks while helping a maturing Silicon Valley start-up IMVU consider the role of avatars, creative expression and social interaction in the virtual world. Our goal was to seek a deep understanding of why users choose to spend their time and money to take part in the online community IMVU all the while creating a productive entrepreneurial team atmosphere. This paper explores the unique dynamics of the research team during the evolving investigation and delivery phase, all the while simultaneously examining the underlying emotions and motives of participants in one virtual community. We start with the belief that every new research team is like a start-up company and there are commonalities or differences between the student academic research environment and the company's organizational culture. Our collaborative research team includes members from areas of engineering, design, psychology, and communication. In this paper, we intend to correlate the factors that make the design team effective, utilize the findings to guide new student teams, and facilitate progress across the stages of the project. Two factors set the stage for insights on entrepreneuring: 1) evolving research team dynamics, and 2) the need-finding interactions with users both inside and outside the industry environment studied (IMVU). Surprising discoveries include a strong gender imbalance in the community as well as users reporting that online “was basically real life.” A palette of stories abstractly parallels the student design team to the start-up they studied. Concepts include: self motivated, ambiguity readiness level, passion, and empathy. The team leader knowingly discussed using an open-process approach. Members noted a considerable lack of reluctance to prototype methods and team presentations; they also reported a deliberate lack of specific planning that they believe contributed to an entertaining and productive team ambiance.

,,,,,,,,,,Crowdsourcing Empathetic Intelligence: The Case of the Annotation of EMMA Database for Emotion and Mood Recognition,"Unobtrusive recognition of the user's mood is an essential capability for affect-adaptive systems. Mood is a subtle, long-term affective state, often misrecognized even by humans. The challenge to train a machine to recognize it from, for example, a video of the user, is significant, and already begins with the lack of ground truth for supervised learning. Existing affective databases consist mainly of short videos, annotated in terms of expressed emotions rather than mood. In very few cases, we encounter perceived mood annotations, of questionable reliability, however, due to the subjectivity of mood estimation and the small number of coders involved. In this work, we introduce a new database for mood recognition from video. Our database contains 180 long, acted videos, depicting typical daily scenarios, and subtle facial and bodily expressions. The videos cover three visual modalities (face, body, Kinect data), and are annotated in terms of emotions (via G-trace) and mood (via the Self-Assessment Manikin and the AffectButton). To annotate the database exhaustively, we exploit crowdsourcing to reach out to an extensive number of nonexpert coders. We validate the reliability of our crowdsourced annotations by (1) adopting a number of criteria to filter out unreliable coders, and (2) comparing the annotations of a subset of our videos with those collected in a controlled lab setting.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2016,"Katsimerou, Christina; Albeda, Joris; Huldtgren, Alina; Heynderickx, Ingrid; Redi, Judith A.",ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology,,2157-6904,G4K2LKQ4,10.1145/2897369,https://doi.org/10.1145/2897369,2016-05-02T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T21:25:58Z,2021-02-15T21:25:58Z,2021-02-15T21:25:14Z,51:1–51:27,,4,7,,ACM Trans.

,,,,,,,,,,The Ethics of Driverless Cars,"This paper critiques the idea of full autonomy, as illustrated by Oxford University's Robotcar. A fully autonomous driverless car relies on no external inputs, including GPS and solely learns from its environment using learning algorithms. These cars decide when they drive, learn from human drivers and bid for insurance in real time. Full autonomy is pitched as a good end in itself, fixing human inadequacies and creating safety and certainty by the elimination of human involvement. Using the ACTIVE ethics framework, an ethical response to the fully autonomous driverless cars is developed by addressing autonomy, community, transparency, identity, value and empathy. I suggest that the pursuit of full autonomy does not recognise the essential importance of interdependencies between humans and machines. The removal of human involvement should require the driverless car to be more connected with its environment, drawing all the information it can from infrastructure, internet and other road users. This requires a systemic view, which addresses systems and relationships, which recognises the place of driverless cars in a connected system, which is open to the study of complex relationships, both networked and hierarchical.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2016,"McBride, Neil",SIGCAS Comput.

,,,,,,,,,,"Show Me You Care: Trait Empathy, Linguistic Style, and Mimicry on Facebook","Linguistic mimicry, the adoption of another’s language patterns, is a subconscious behavior with pro-social benefits. However, some professions advocate its conscious use in empathic communication. This involves mutual mimicry; effective communicators mimic their interlocutors, who also mimic them back. Since mimicry has often been studied in face-to-face contexts, we ask whether individuals with empathic dispositions have unique communication styles and/or elicit mimicry in mediated communication on Facebook. Participants completed Davis’s Interpersonal Reactivity Index and provided access to Facebook activity. We confirm that dispositional empathy is correlated to the use of particular stylistic features. In addition, we identify four empathy profiles and find correlations to writing style. When a linguistic feature is used, this often “triggers” use by friends. However, the presence of particular features, rather than participant disposition, best predicts mimicry. This suggests that machine-human communications could be enhanced based on recently used features, without extensive user profiling.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2017,"Otterbacher, Jahna; Ang, Chee Siang; Litvak, Marina; Atkins, David",ACM Trans.

Through the definition of adequate models these parameters allow to infer the wellbeing, empathy, or engagement of humans in different contexts. In this paper, we show that off-the-shelf wearable devices can be used to unobtrusively monitor the emotional engagement of students during lectures. We propose the use of several novel features to capture students' momentary engagement and use existing methods to characterize the general arousal of students and their physiological synchrony with the teacher. To evaluate our method we collect a data set that – after data cleaning – contains data from 24 students, 9 teachers, and 41 lectures. Our results show that non-engaged students can be identified with high reliability. Using a Support Vector Machine, for instance, we achieve a recall of 81% – which is a 25 percentage points improvement with respect to a Biased Random classifier. Overall, our findings may inform the design of systems that allow students to self-monitor their engagement and act upon the obtained feedback. Teachers could profit of information about non-engaged students too to perform self-reflection and to devise and evaluate methods to (re-)engage students.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2018,"Di Lascio, Elena; Gashi, Shkurta; Santini, Silvia",Proc.

There is a vital need for engaging, sustainable, and scalable resources to support social, physical, and emotional wellbeing amongst caregivers of PWD. To explore this open design space, we designed and conducted a 6-week mixed-method evaluation of Go&amp;Grow, a pervasive social exergame in which flowers grow as users increase physical activity and interact with other caregivers of PWD. Our findings showed that using Go&amp;Grow helped participants relieve stress, increase physical activity, and develop empathy for and patience towards the loved one with dementia that they cared for. At the same time, tension arose as some caregivers desired to learn about the life challenges that Go&amp;Grow users faced, while others hesitated to share such content.

Yet, little is known about these processes of technology appropriation and how care practices are impacted. Adopting a relational perspective of care, we longitudinally examined how four family care networks appropriated a new commercial ICT service into their existing technological arrangements and care practices. Cross-case analysis interpreted collaborative appropriation to encompass two interrelated processes of creating and adapting technological practices and negotiating and augmenting care relationships. Four driving forces were also proposed: motivating meanings that actors ascribe to the technology and its use; the learnability of the technology and actors’ resourcefulness; the establishment of responsive and cooperative care practices; and the qualities of empathy and shared power in care relationships. The importance of technological literacy, learning, meaning-making, and the nature and quality of care relationships are discussed.

,,,,,,,,,,Digital Augmentation of Historical Objects Through Tangible Interaction,"The technological advances brought about by the Internet of Things enable new opportunities for a more direct interaction among users, objects, and places. This is an extremely valuable innovation for the cultural heritage sector, as it allows a more transparent use of technology in the digital augmentation of museums and cultural heritage sites. The possibility to augment physical objects with sensors detecting when they are moved and manipulated enables scenarios where descriptive information about objects is presented to users at the very exact time they are looking at them, stimulating engagement. This article describes a collaborative research effort among cultural heritage professionals, human–computer interaction experts, and developers that was aimed at investigating the goals and constraints curators consider for a physical encounter between visitors and historic relics. In a case study, we co-designed an interactive plinth centred on tangible interaction and evaluated the impact on the user experience of combining digital information with a hands-on experience of relics of World War I. Our findings show that visitors value this type of tangible interaction with collection objects positively, as it allows the discovery of details and the learning of aspects that normally go unnoticed.

,,,,,,,,,,Persuasive robotic assistant for health self-management of older adults: Design and evaluation of social behaviors,"Daily health self-management, such as the harmonization of food, exercise and medication, is a major problem for a large group of older adults with obesity or diabetics. Computer-based personal assistance can help to behave healthy by persuading and guiding older adults. For effective persuasion, the assistant should express social behaviors (e.g., turn taking, emotional expressions) to be trustworthy and show empathy. From the motivational interviewing method and synthetic assistants’ literature, we derived a set of social behaviors, and implemented a subset in a physical character, a virtual character and a text interface. The first behavior type concerns conversing with high-level dialogue (semantics, intentions), which could be implemented in all 3 assistants. The other behavior types could only be implemented in the characters: showing natural cues (e.g., gaze, posture), expressing emotions (e.g., compassionate face), and accommodating social conversations (e.g., turn taking). In an experiment, 24 older adults (45–65) interacted with the text interface and one of the characters, conform a “one-week diabetics scenario”. They experienced the virtual and physical character as more empathic and trustworthy than the text-based assistant, and expressed more conversational behavior with the characters. However, it seems that the preference of interacting with the character or the text interface was influenced by the conscientiousness of the participant; more conscientious people liked the text interface better. Older adults responded more negative to the characters that lacked the social behaviors than to the text interface. Some differences between the virtual and physical character probably occurred due to the specific constraints of the physical character.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2010,"Looije, Rosemarijn; Neerincx, Mark A.; Cnossen, Fokie",International Journal of Human-Computer Studies,,1071-5819,9GU6IVJZ,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhcs.2009.08.007,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S107158190900113X,2010-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T21:45:52Z,2021-02-15T21:45:52Z,,386-397,,6,68,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>Human-Computer Interaction for Medicine and Health care (HCI4MED): Towards making Information usable</p>,,Health-care; Persuasive computing; Human–robot interaction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Science Direct,persuasive robotic assistant for health self-management of older adults: design and evaluation of social behaviors,persuasive robotic assistant for health selfmanagement of older adults design and evaluation of social behaviors

Participants were presented with different primes (a male, a female and a robotic grasping-hand; a male and a female static-hand; a control stimulus) and objects representing two risk levels (neutral and dangerous). The task required that a natural/artifact categorization task be performed by pressing different keys. In both adults and children graspable objects activated a facilitating motor response, while dangerous objects evoked aversive affordances, generating an interference-effect. Both children and adults were sensitive to the distinction between biological and non-biological hands, however detailed resonant mechanisms related to the hand-prime gender emerged only in adults.

The present paper follows this tradition and describes a prototype of a care robot that is endowed with affective capabilities. The paper describes some of the potential ethical problems arising from such a technology. This aspect of the paper is based on prior research in a European-funded technology foresight project that explored the ethical issues of emerging ICTs. The paper goes beyond the description of technical innovation and its ethical consequences. The recognition of the ethical relevance of research and innovation has spawned a discourse around responsible research and innovation. The paper draws on this discourse, which aims at anticipatory technology governance to ensure the social acceptability and desirability of technologies. The prototype vignette of the paper explores how responsible research and innovation could be realised in practice and how it could be used to address ethical issues such as those of affective care robots.

,,,,,,,,,,EEG based functional connectivity analysis of human pain empathy towards humans and robots,"Humans can show emotional reactions toward humanoid robots, such as empathy. Previous neuroimaging studies have indicated that neural responses of empathy for others' pain are modulated by an early automatic emotional sharing and a late controlled cognitive evaluation process. Recent studies about pain empathy for robots found humans present similar empathy process towards humanoid robots under painful stimuli as well as to humans. However, the whole-brain functional connectivity and the spatial dynamics of neural activities underlying empathic processes are still unknown. In the present study, the functional connectivity was investigated for ERPs recorded from 18 healthy adults who were presented with pictures of human hand and robot hand under painful and non-painful situations. Functional brain networks for both early and late empathy responses were constructed and a new parameter, empathy index (EI), was proposed to represent the empathy ability of humans quantitatively. We found that the mutual dependences between early ERP components was significantly decreased, but for the late components, there were no significant changes. The mutual dependences for human hand stimuli were larger than to robot hand stimuli for early components, but not for late components. The connectivity weights for early components were larger than late components. EI value shows significant difference between painful and non-painful stimuli, indicating it is a good indicator to represent the empathy of humans. This study enriches our understanding of the neurological mechanisms implicated in human empathy, and provides evidence of functional connectivity for both early and late responses of pain empathy towards humans and robots.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2021,"Chang, Wenwen; Wang, Hong; Yan, Guanghui; Lu, Zhiguo; Liu, Chong; Hua, Chengcheng",Neuropsychologia,,0028-3932,V268ENES,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2020.107695,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028393220303675,2021-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T21:45:52Z,2021-02-15T21:45:52Z,,107695,,,151,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,EEG; Functional connectivity; Empathy; Human-robot interaction; Empathy index; Mutual information,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Science Direct,eeg based functional connectivity analysis of human pain empathy towards humans and robots,eeg based functional connectivity analysis of human pain empathy towards humans and robots

Children’s conceptions of personified robots and the emergence of a new ontological category,"Imagining another’s perspective is an achievement in social cognition and underlies empathic concern and moral regard. Imagination is also within the realm of fantasy, and may take the form of imaginary play in children and imaginative production in adults. Yet, an interesting and provocative question emerges in the case of personified robots: How do people conceive of life-like robots? Do people imagine about robots’ experiences? If so, do these imaginings reflect their actual or pretend beliefs about robots? The answers to these questions bear on the possibility that personified robots represent the emergence of a new ontological category. We draw on simulation theory as a framework for imagining others’ internal states as well as a means for imaginative play. We then turn to the literature on people’s and, in particular, children’s conceptions of personified technologies and raise the question of the veracity of children’s beliefs about personified robots (i.e., are they behaving as or behaving as if?). Finally, we consider the suggestion that such personified technologies represent the emergence of a new ontological category and offer some suggestions for future research in this important emerging area of social cognition.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2010,"Severson, Rachel L.; Carlson, Stephanie M.",Neural Networks,,0893-6080,4BRRSXXS,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neunet.2010.08.014,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608010001656,2010-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T21:45:52Z,2021-02-15T21:45:52Z,,1099-1103,,8,23,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>Social Cognition: From Babies to Robots</p>,,Robots; Children; Ontological category; Pretense; Simulation theory,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Science Direct,behaving as or behaving as if? children’s conceptions of personified robots and the emergence of a new ontological category,behaving as or behaving as if childrens conceptions of personified robots and the emergence of a new ontological category

In line with the Media Equation, humans may react towards robots as they do towards humans, making it all the more important to carefully investigate the preconditions and consequences of contact with robots. Based on assumptions on the socialness of reactions towards robots, we conducted a study that provides further insights into the question of whether humans show emotional reactions towards a robot and whether these reactions differ from those towards a human. To explore emotionality in human–robot interaction we conducted an fMRI study (n=14). Participants were presented videos showing a human, a robot and an inanimate object, being treated in either an affectionate or in a violent way. Self-reported emotional states and functional imaging data revealed that participants indeed reacted emotionally when seeing the affectionate and violent videos.

This brain activity is further modulated by low- and high-order factors, e.g., the perceived intensity of the model's pain and the model's similarity with the onlooker, respectively. We investigated which specific aspect of similarity modulates such empathic reactivity, focusing on the potential differentiation between visual similarity and psychological closeness between the onlooker and different types of models. To this aim, we recorded fMRI data in neurotypical participants who observed painful and tactile stimuli delivered to an adult human hand, a baby human hand, a puppy dog paw, and an anthropomorphic robotic hand. The interaction between type of vicarious experience (pain, touch) and nature of model (adult, baby, dog, robot) showed that the right supramarginal gyrus (rSMG) was selectively active for visual similarity (more active during vicarious pain for the adult and baby models), while the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) was more sensitive to psychological closeness (specifically linked to vicarious pain for the baby model).

,,,,,,,,,,Bridging big data and qualitative methods in the social sciences: A case study of Twitter responses to high profile deaths by suicide,"With the rise of social media, a vast amount of new primary research material has become available to social scientists, but the sheer volume and variety of this make it difficult to access through the traditional approaches: close reading and nuanced interpretations of manual qualitative coding and analysis. This paper sets out to bridge the gap by developing semi-automated replacements for manual coding through a mixture of crowdsourcing and machine learning, seeded by the development of a careful manual coding scheme from a small sample of data. To show the promise of this approach, we attempt to create a nuanced categorisation of responses on Twitter to several recent high profile deaths by suicide. Through these, we show that it is possible to code automatically across a large dataset to a high degree of accuracy (71%), and discuss the broader possibilities and pitfalls of using Big Data methods for Social Science.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2017,"Karamshuk, Dmytro; Shaw, Frances; Brownlie, Julie; Sastry, Nishanth",Online Social Networks and Media,,2468-6964,2W85QYR4,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.osnem.2017.01.002,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468696416300076,2017-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T21:49:29Z,2021-02-15T21:49:29Z,,33-43,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Natural language processing; Crowd-sourcing; Crowdflower; Emotional distress; High-profile suicides; Public empathy; Social media; Social science,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Science Direct,bridging big data and qualitative methods in the social sciences: a case study of twitter responses to high profile deaths by suicide,bridging big data and qualitative methods in the social sciences a case study of twitter responses to high profile deaths by suicide

The purpose of this study is to compare two models describing social-emotional behavior, one of which is based on a traditional machine learning algorithm, and the other on a cognitive architecture supporting social emotionality. It is hypothesized that the second model will be more efficient in eliciting user's empathy to a virtual cobot based on this model. Here the object of study is a virtual pet: a penguin. Two models controlling the pet were compared: a reinforcement learning model (a Q-learning algorithm) and the emotional cognitive architecture eBICA (Samsonovich, 2013). The second approach was based on a semantic map of pet's emotional states, that was constructed based on the human ranking. It is found that the eBICA model scores higher in participant's empathy compared to the model based on reinforcement learning. This article compares strengths and weaknesses of both methods. In conclusion, the findings indicate advantages of the approach based on eBICA compared to more traditional techniques.

Methods Using transcripts from 353 primary care office visits with 350 patients and 84 physicians (Cook, 2002 [1], Tai-Seale et al., 2015 [2]), we developed two machine learning models (a recurrent neural network with a hierarchical structure and a logistic regression classifier) to recognize the emotional valence (positive, negative, neutral) (Posner et al., 2005 [3]) of each utterance. We examined the agreement of human-generated ratings of emotional valence with machine learning model ratings of emotion. Results The agreement of emotion ratings from the recurrent neural network model with human ratings was comparable to that of human-human inter-rater agreement. The weighted-average of the correlation coefficients for the recurrent neural network model with human raters was 0.60, and the human rater agreement was also 0.60. Conclusions The recurrent neural network model predicted the emotional valence of patients and physicians in primary care visits with similar reliability as human raters.

Objectives To evaluate the impact of Hub and Spoke model(s) of clinical practice placement across geographically diverse locations, with a particular focus on enhancing the student practice learning experience. Design Multiple case study design. Setting & Participants Comprised undergraduate student nurses from Adult, Learning Disability and Mental Health programmes from 3 Scottish Schools of Nursing. Methods A mixed methods approach which included quantitative and qualitative date tools. Results All three Hub and Spoke models shared two broad findings:1)In the three Hub and Spoke models detailed in this paper, there is a continuum of student led learning which supports the process with opportunities for individual students to be positively innovative and creative in their learning approaches. Depth of learning was achieved in two ways; a) the method in which Hub placements are organised, managed and structured and, b) the depth of empathy and sensitivity to the individual at the centre of the care.2)Placement capacity is increased: The classification of placements is reviewed to produce broader categories, Engagement of mentors/enhanced student/mentor relationship.

It follows that parents can also be a central part of neonatal education for staff in the neonatal speciality. This paper focuses on what students and staff can learn from parents about what they feel is important to make their experience better. A narrative, interpretive approach was undertaken to collect and analyse parent interview narratives. A specific question was posed to a purposive sample of parents who have had premature babies about what health professionals can learn from them. Thematic analysis revealed five key themes relating to the importance of: communicating; listening; empathising; acknowledging (the parent's role); realising (what matters to parents). These elements were incorporated into a framework named by the mnemonic, ‘CLEAR’. This highlights what parents want staff to be cognisant of when caring for them and their babies. Learning from the parents in our care enables a greater understanding of their experiences at difficult and challenging times.

,,,,,,,,,,A comparison of three types of stimulus material in undergraduate mental health nursing education,"Summary Aims and objectives The paper discusses an innovative educational approach that compared the use of different textual forms as stimulus materials in the teaching of an introductory mental health course. Background Practitioners in many disciplines, including nursing, appreciate the value of narratives in making sense of experiences, challenging assumptions and enhancing learning: they enable exploration of reality from different perspectives and create an emotional resonance. Narratives help nursing students to uncover embedded meanings, values and beliefs; they can include written texts, illustrated texts or picture books. Participants 180 students enrolled in an elective undergraduate nursing course. Method This project afforded students the choice of critically analysing (a) a chapter from one of two autobiographies, (b) an illustrated text, or (c) an illustration from a picture book. Each text was a narrative account from a personal or carer's perspective of the experience of mental illness. Their written submissions were then analysed by means of a qualitative descriptive approach. Results In analysis of the autobiographies students tended to paraphrase the authors' words and summarise their experiences. Those choosing the illustrated text were able to link the images and text, and provide a deeper and more insightful level of interpretation, albeit influenced by the author's personal account and expressed emotions; however, those analysing a picture book illustration demonstrated a surprising level of critical and creative thinking, and their interpretations were empathetic, insightful and thoughtful.

Diabetes camp is a setting that provides experiential learning on a topic that is crucial for future dietitians. Objective The objective of this study was to explore whether and how educational experiences at a residential camp for children with type 1 diabetes changes knowledge, perceptions, confidence, and empathy of the disease for dietetics students. Qualitative research methods were used to explore and understand participants’ experience of hands-on involvement with type one diabetes. Study Design, Setting, Participants This study was a qualitative, 2-year longitudinal case study at Camp Kno-Koma, the Diabetes Camp of West Virginia. Four dietetic students were recruited to participate in this study through convenience sampling. Students were in varying stages of their dietetics education. Measurable Outcome/Analysis Multiple qualitative methods were used to collect data: interviews; observations; Photovoice, a type of participatory action research in which photographs identified significant learning experiences; journaling; and focus groups. Thematic analysis was used to identify emerging themes and summarize findings through triangulation. Results Qualitative data analysis revealed that experiential learning at diabetes camp provides an opportunity for dietetics students to experience in-depth learning, including: increase in knowledge of the disease, perceptions of living with the disease, confidence in treating the disease, and empathy for those who have been diagnosed. While attending camp for one week is beneficial for experiential learning, returning for another week the following year provided a deeper understanding of the disease process. Students identified wearing an insulin pump and “living with diabetes” were their best learning experiences.

Most service user involvement is through classroom visits. Digital stories, film and audio are alternatives but lack the interactivity and development of reflection that can be achieved through face-to-face contact. This report reviews the background to service user involvement in healthcare professional education then provides a reflective account of a novel initiative whereby a spinal-injured patient was involved in creating a digital story around some of his in-hospital experiences and then engaged in online discussions with post-registration nursing (degree) and practice educator (masters) students. These discussions provided a richer experience for the students enabling them to reflect more deeply on how nursing care is delivered and perceived by service users. The report concludes that digital stories can be used with repeated groups to inspire discussion and reflection. Augmenting such digital stories with online discussions with the service user whose story is told helps practitioners develop greater empathy, insight and understanding which are beneficial for improving service delivery and nursing care.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2012,"Terry, Louise M.",Nurse Education Today,,0260-6917,DLYXISXQ,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nedt.2011.06.006,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S026069171100147X,2012-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T21:49:59Z,2021-02-15T21:49:59Z,,161-166,,2,32,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>Service User &amp; Education</p>,,Digital stories; E-learning; Nurse education; Service user involvement,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Science Direct,service user involvement in nurse education: a report on using online discussions with a service user to augment his digital story,service user involvement in nurse education a report on using online discussions with a service user to augment his digital story

Memory-work, a feminist, qualitative methodology, was chosen because it centres critical tourism inquiry within the context of sharing meaningful, personal experiences. The team met regularly to engage in supportive, critical dialogue about their memories and to spark critical reflections about tourism more broadly. Four substantive themes (embodied remembering, gendered bodies, racialized bodies, and embodying the gaze) were developed from collective analyses of initial discussions. A deeper reflection on the potential of this approach for engendering critical tourism pedagogy was also undertaken to explore its potential as critical tourism pedagogy. Five pedagogical themes (building safe spaces and developing trust, creating empathy, engaging tourism literature in ‘real life’, opening doors for ongoing reflection, and decentring power and knowledge) were identified.

,,,,,,,,,,Intergenerational transmission of antisocial personality disorder: Maternal role and its declination,"Antisocial personality disorder is a well-established disease which features space from cruelty to lack of empathy and remorse. Its etiology has been deeply analyzed both for genetic and environmental implications. The role of family context has been underlined throughout the whole psychopathology as an explanation to the etiological conflict between nature and nurture. Even if this conflict seems to be apparently solved, it is still possible to ponder about family implications in terms of causes and consequences. In the antisocial field, maternal role may offer interesting and surprising food for thought. Even if it is commonly believed an intergenerational transmission of aberrant behaviors, particularly in terms of learning behaviors and lack of empathy assimilation, it exists a side part of maternal pathological expression that may play a role in the intergenerational transmission and it is extremely difficult to be detected. Female declination of this disorder may be expressed also through somatic implications and complaints, leading to the hypothesis of a self-reflection of the lack of consideration for other's needs, which is distinctive. It is of extreme importance, particularly in terms of prevention, to consider and identify these connotations of the disorder to be able to try to interrupt the cycle of transmission through generations.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2017,"Giacomo, E.

,,,,,,,,,,The influence of the simulation strategy over the improvement of the classroom climate,"The school climate is a process, structure of values and norms that canalize the teachers and the pupils in a direction of successful teaching and learning, increasing the effectiveness of the organizational set of the school building. The main aim of the simulation strategy is creating as much as possible closer situation to the real life or the pupils’ life experience. Through this strategy the pupils learn certain principles, skills of understanding and cognitive thinking, psychomotor skills and values/ ways of behavior, connected with certain certification, influences, readiness, alertness and empathy. The aim of this research is directed to assessment of the influence of the simulation strategy over the improvement of the classroom climate. From the actions, in this research were used observant field notes, that enabled an insight of the event through direct listening and looking by the pupils, and conceptual field notes that enabled making conclusions from the observation. From the instruments for registering the data was used a protocol for observation, aimed to the students, the pupils were observed during the classes and during the break. Another instrument that was used for the research is the questionnaire, aimed to the teachers and the experts.

,,,,,,,,,,“It Allows You to Challenge Your Beliefs”: Examining Medical Students’ Reactions to First Trimester Abortion,"Background Abortion is a common medical procedure, integral to women's health, and a core educational topic for medical students. Medical schools often rely on brief clinical exposure to abortion during the obstetrics and gynecology clerkship to provide this learning. Abortion is also a highly politicized and stigmatized procedure. Given this potential conflict, we examine medical student reactions to their observation of abortion care. Study Design Medical students in their second and third years at an academic medical center who observed in a first trimester abortion clinic completed open-ended, written questionnaires. Questionnaires explored student reactions to participating in the abortion clinic. We used applied thematic analysis to code and qualitatively analyze 78 questionnaires. Results We identified the following five themes: (1) students found participating in abortion care deeply worthwhile, (2) some were challenged by their reactions, particularly when reactions conflicted with prior beliefs, (3) some demonstrated empathy for the patient, but (4) some expressed judgment of both the patient and the abortion provider, and (5) students reported a desire for curricular change around abortion education, requesting more time for reflection, and some felt that their abortion observation might better prepare them to serve future patients. Conclusions Observing in an abortion clinic is a valued experience that allows students to challenge their existing beliefs and may build empathy. Educators should provide students with adequate time for preparation and reflection around this topic and address areas of misunderstanding that may perpetuate abortion stigma. These findings may inform medical student curriculum changes around abortion.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2020,"Rivlin, Katherine; Sedlander, Erica; Cepin, Ana",Women's Health Issues,,1049-3867,6F9J5WZM,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.whi.2020.06.004,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1049386720300487,2020-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T21:50:00Z,2021-02-15T21:50:00Z,,353-358,,5,30,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Science Direct,“it allows you to challenge your beliefs”: examining medical students’ reactions to first trimester abortion,it allows you to challenge your beliefs examining medical students reactions to first trimester abortion

This research aims to explain the benefits of VR in transforming learning and student experiences in classrooms. The experiment involved students using an educational VR experience that features an immersive narrative that puts students in the centre of a historical moment in World War Two. Two separate studies were conducted. One with high school students in Australia who would normally be studying the topic. And the other, University students in India, with no prior knowledge or awareness of the topic. Student participants used one of two different versions of Kokoda VR; six-degrees of freedom virtual reality or 360° video. Both the university and high school students using the virtual reality condition reported higher engagement, presence, empathy and better knowledge mastery than the 360° video groups. These features were also slightly higher in the university student group than in the high school student group except for the knowledge mastery where the high school students performed better.

In this study, we investigated the influence of the visualization of a real-time personalized avatar on gait parameters, focusing on knee flexion during the swing phase. We also studied the impact of the modification of avatar's knee amplitude on kinematic of the knee of healthy subjects. For this purpose, we used an immersive reality treadmill equipment and developed a 3D avatar, with instantly modifiable parameters for knee flexion and extension (acceleration or deceleration). Fourteen healthy young adults, equipped with motion capture markers, were asked to walk at a self-selected pace on the treadmill. A real-time 3D image of their lower limbs was modelized and projected on the screen ahead of them, as if in a walking motion from left to right. The subjects were instructed to continue walking. When we initiated an increase in the knee flexion of the avatar, we observed a similar increase in the subjects' knee flexion. No significant results were observed when the modification involved a decrease in knee flexion. The results and their significance are discussed using theories encompassing empathy, sympathy and sensory re-calibration.

,,,,,,,,,,Meeting others virtually in a day-to-day setting: Investigating social avoidance and prosocial behavior towards avatars and agents,"Given the increasing use of virtual characters, research is challenged to gain sufficient knowledge on the effects they may have on human cognitions, emotions and behaviors. Thus, this study set out to examine social avoidance tendencies and prosocial behaviors towards human controlled (avatars) and computer controlled entities (agents). A total of N = 95 healthy young adults were randomly assigned to an avatar or agent condition. Participants were exposed to a virtual stranger asking to sit at the table (prosocial behavior) as well as a virtual waiter handing over the false drink (social avoidance). Empathy, interaction anxiety, social and physical presence as well as subjective stress levels were assessed to control for confounding influences. Empathy emerged as a significant predictor of prosocial behavior. Social avoidance, in turn, was not predicted by any of the included variables. Also, there was no effect of agency on social presence, physical presence, social interaction anxiety and stress. Yet, participants showed significantly more social avoidance and prosocial behavior towards avatars. These seemingly contradictory results may be explained by an extension of prior theories: While intuitive responses (e.g., stress) follow the Media Equation Concept (Nass & Moon, 2000), more complex processes (e.g., empathy) may modulate agency dependent responses.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2018,"Felnhofer, Anna; Kafka, Johanna X.; Hlavacs, Helmut; Beutl, Leon; Kryspin-Exner, Ilse; Kothgassner, Oswald D.",Computers in Human Behavior,,0747-5632,74LT9YSR,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2017.11.031,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563217306696,2018-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T21:50:15Z,2021-02-15T21:50:15Z,,399-406,,,80,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Virtual reality; Empathy; Prosocial behavior; Avatar; Agent; Social presence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Science Direct,meeting others virtually in a day-to-day setting: investigating social avoidance and prosocial behavior towards avatars and agents,meeting others virtually in a daytoday setting investigating social avoidance and prosocial behavior towards avatars and agents

Given the prevalence of computer-animated human characters and a narrative framework in videogames, serious games, and health-related scenarios, it is important to examine how the uncanny valley influences narrative empathy and enjoyment. In a 2 × 2 × 2 between-groups posttest-only experiment, 738 participants took the role of a patient in a virtual consultation with a doctor; the consultation varied in the doctor's character (hero or villain), its subplot ending (happy or tragic), and its depiction (computer animated or real). The participants' posttest results showed greater emotional empathy and enjoyment in the hero condition and no significant difference in emotional empathy for the computer animation but greater narrative enjoyment and persuasion. Just endings (hero rewarded, villain punished) elicited much greater pleasure than unjust endings. In comparing computer animation with recorded video, emotional empathy was a significantly stronger predictor of narrative enjoyment than transportation only for the real hero with a tragic ending.

Methods Pathological and addicted internet gamers as well as social network users were compared with healthy controls regarding psychometric and neurobiological measures of self-concept-related characteristics, avatar identification and emotional inhibitory control processing. Results and conclusion Psychometric results indicated that both subgroups showed higher self-concept deficits compared to healthy controls. Neurobiologically, different brain activation patterns were observed in the subgroups during self-knowledge retrieval and inhibition of emotional stimuli.

,,,,,,,,,,Psychological and Neurobiological Mechanisms of Pathological Internet Use,"Background Studies on internet gaming disorders indicate that especially online role-playing games have a high addictive potential in particular in male adolescents. These games enable the parallel gaming of multiple users in online virtual worlds with or against each other via their graphical agent (avatar). Recent findings suggest online role-playing addicts to have a deficient self-concept. The latter's potential compensation by means of a higher identification with the own avatar might be an etiological factor in the development of an online role-playing game addiction. On a neurobiological level, especially the left Angular Gyrus (AG) seems to be associated with identification and empathy processes. An according fMRI-based study on long-term gamers of online role-playing games indicated increased brain activations in the left AG during the rating of personality traits referring to the avatar relative to self-referencing and the referencing of close others (Ganesh et al., 2011). However, the extent to which these results represent specific neurobiological mechanisms that are associated with self-concept deficits or a stronger identification with the own avatar in the development of online role-playing game addiction remains unknown to date. Methods N=16 addicted and n=17 regular gamers of online role-playing games (mean age=28 and 26 years, respectively) underwent functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) while 1) completing a Giessen-Test (GT)-derived paradigm assessing participants’ concepts of self, ideal and avatar and 2) while viewing and evaluating images of the own person, the own avatar as well as unknown persons. Additionally, a questionnaire referring to the own body image and a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for the evaluation of the own as well as avatar's attractiveness, sympathy and gender identity were applied. Results Addicts of online role-playing games rated their body image, gender identity and social response (i.e. social popularity) significantly lower. Neurobiologically, they showed increased left AG activations during the reflection about their avatar (relative to their ideal and/or their self) compared to non-addicted gamers. Furthermore, within-group differences revealed left AG response during the perception of images showing their avatar (relative to images of themselves). In addition, addicted gamers had hypoactivations in the bilateral AG during the perception of images of their own person compared to the perception of unknown persons. The left-lateral AG hypoactivation positively correlated with the degree of the gender identity. Discussion In line with previous findings, our results indicate self-concept deficits in online role-playing game addicts and a stronger identification with the own avatar, which might neurobiologically be reflected in AG activations. The results could point towards problems in the formation of an own identity as a cause for online role-playing game addiction development.

The different contributions of these processes have not been teased apart. By capitalizing on the power of Immersive Virtual Reality, we explored how behavioural (subjective ratings) and physiological reactivity (skin conductance reactivity, SCR) to pain and pleasure delivered to an avatar was influenced by Cognitive stance and Physical perspective. Taking an Other-Oriented stance leads to attributing higher congruent valence (i.e. pain rated as unpleasant and pleasure as pleasant) and intensity to the stimuli and induces reduced SCR.

However, these effects were moderated by participants’ beliefs about their interaction partner. Specifically, smiles enhanced social evaluations of embodied agents but degraded them for avatars.

The interventions were based on three psychological mechanisms: induction of a descriptive norm, induction of a prescriptive norm, and empathy induction. Each intervention was generated using a communicating bot. Participants exposed to these interventions were compared with a control group that received no intervention. The bot-generated normative communications (both the ones priming descriptive and the ones priming prescriptive norms), as well as the empathizing intervention, reduced the proportion of verbal aggression posted by Reddit accounts. All three interventions proved effective in reducing verbal violence when compared with the control condition. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2021,"Bilewicz, M.; Tempska, P.; Leliwa, G.; Dowgiałło, M.; Tańska, M.; Urbaniak, R.; Wroczyński, M.",Aggressive Behavior,,,9RVTE2H9,10.1002/ab.21948,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100209523&doi=10.1002%2fab.21948&partnerID=40&md5=9c486d6fb70ead5dab93d1c932aada1c,2021-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:33:58Z,2021-02-15T22:33:58Z,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 0</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,artificial intelligence against hate: intervention reducing verbal aggression in the social network environment,artificial intelligence against hate intervention reducing verbal aggression in the social network environment
,,,,,,,,,,Searching for distress of similar situation from CQA content,"In this study, we tackle the problem of retrieving questions from a corpus archived in a Community Question Answering service that a consultant having distress can feel empathy with them. We hypothesize that the consultant feels empathy with the questions having a similar situation with that of the consultant’s distress, and propose a method of retrieving similar sentences focusing on the situation of the distress. Specifically, we propose two approaches to fine-tuning the pre-trained BERT model so that the learned model better captures the similarity of the situation between distress. One tries to extract only the words representing the situation of the distress, the other tries to predict whether the two sentences show the same situation. The data for training the models are gathered by the crowdsourcing task where the workers are asked to gather the sentences whose situation is similar to the given sentence and to annotate the words in the sentences that represent the situation. The data is then used to fine-tune the BERT model. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is evaluated with the baselines such as TF-IDF, Okapi BM25, and the pre-trained BERT. The results of the experiment with 20 queries showed that one of our methods achieved the highest nDCG@5 while we could not observe any significant differences among the methods. © 2021, Japanese Society for Artificial Intelligence.

,,,,,,,,,,A framework of artificial intelligence augmented design support,"Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence raise interest in its participation in design activity, which is commonly considered to be complex and human-dominated. In this work, we aim to examine AI roles in early design stages. The human ideation components and design tools related to AI are discussed in a framework of AI-augmented design support. The framework develops a hierarchy of design cognition (basis), approaches and principles. The cognitive models are constructed in an empirical study of 30 designers (26 for analysis, 4 for pilot study) by concurrent Think-Aloud protocol and behavior analysis. The process of producing new design ideas is explained by a transparent analysis of designers’ language and behaviors. Three strategies to organize cognitive activities in design ideation are summarized: develop structured consideration, relate to a scenario, and stick-to designing. These strategies suggest AI could act as (1) representation creation, (2) empathy trigger and (3) engagement, in principles of “knowledge-driven” and “decompose-and-integrate”. The design support with AI provides new perspectives on computer-based design tools that limit to well-defined design variables. The framework is built on a generic notion of design activity and “mimic” human design rationales, expected to benefit research of domain-independent computational design supports and cognitive supports. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2020,"Liao, J.; Hansen, P.; Chai, C.",Human-Computer Interaction,,,VS6NZGTH,10.1080/07370024.2020.1733576,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85084312865&doi=10.1080%2f07370024.2020.1733576&partnerID=40&md5=098f22d0398c863d6ad804592ff100f6,2020-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:33:58Z,2021-02-15T22:33:58Z,,511-544,,5-6,35,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 0</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,a framework of artificial intelligence augmented design support,a framework of artificial intelligence augmented design support
,,,,,,,,,,Envisioning an artificial intelligence documentation assistant for future primary care consultations: A co-design study with general practitioners,"Objective: The study sought to understand the potential roles of a future artificial intelligence (AI) documentation assistant in primary care consultations and to identify implications for doctors, patients, healthcare system, and technology design from the perspective of general practitioners. Materials and Methods: Co-design workshops with general practitioners were conducted. The workshops focused on (1) understanding the current consultation context and identifying existing problems, (2) ideating future solutions to these problems, and (3) discussing future roles for AI in primary care. The workshop activities included affinity diagramming, brainwriting, and video prototyping methods. The workshops were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Inductive thematic analysis of the transcripts of conversations was performed. Results: Two researchers facilitated 3 co-design workshops with 16 general practitioners. Three main themes emerged: professional autonomy, human-AI collaboration, and new models of care. Major implications identified within these themes included (1) concerns with medico-legal aspects arising from constant recording and accessibility of full consultation records, (2) future consultations taking place out of the exam rooms in a distributed system involving empowered patients, (3) human conversation and empathy remaining the core tasks of doctors in any future AI-enabled consultations, and (4) questioning the current focus of AI initiatives on improved efficiency as opposed to patient care. Conclusions: AI documentation assistants will likely to be integral to the future primary care consultations. However, these technologies will still need to be supervised by a human until strong evidence for reliable autonomous performance is available. Therefore, different human-AI collaboration models will need to be designed and evaluated to ensure patient safety, quality of care, doctor safety, and doctor autonomy. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

In recent years, the quest for greater efficiency in health care, including economic efficiency, has often resulted in the side-lining of these values, making it difficult for health-care professionals to incorporate them in practice. Artificial intelligence is increasingly being used in health care. This technology promises greater efficiency and more free time for health-care professionals to focus on the human side of care, including fostering trust relationships and engaging with patients with empathy and compassion. This article considers the vision of efficient, empathetic and trustworthy health care put forward by the proponents of artificial intelligence. The paper suggests that artificial intelligence has the potential to fundamentally alter the way in which empathy, compassion and trust are currently regarded and practised in health care. Moving forward, it is important to re-evaluate whether and how these values could be incorporated and practised within a health-care system where artificial intelligence is increasingly used. Most importantly, society needs to re-examine what kind of health care it ought to promote. © 2020, World Health Organization.

,,,,,,,,,,The effect of empathy on human-agent interaction,"Technology development and information communication have led to an in-crease of human-agent communication and provided an opportunity to overcome the ex-isting limitation human-human communication. Psychological counseling studies suggest conventional face-to-face counseling method can replace the role of a counselor by ap-plying agent technology. The present study has been established to identify the effects of empathy in human-agent interaction. In order to do so, we designed and conducted a pilot study of a prototype of counseling conversation based on psychological counseling theory. We have found that empathic agents resulted in lower score on counselor’s as-sessment and lower level of empathy perceived by the subjects. The simple empathy used in this study may have given the participants a sense of imitating a clumsy human be-ing and have caused a higher level of displeasure and discomfort compared to the agents without empathy response. This study is meaningful in that it provides basic data for developing and improving an artificial intelligence-based psychological counseling system by designing artificial intelligence counseling agents and varying levels of empathy. © ICIC International 2020.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2020,"Kim, H.C.; Cha, M.C.; Ji, Y.G.","ICIC Express Letters, Part B: Applications",,,KV34A3NB,10.24507/icicelb.11.06.551,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085004414&doi=10.24507%2ficicelb.11.06.551&partnerID=40&md5=2a2ed44f0075def60a3d405839efaab1,2020-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:33:59Z,2021-02-15T22:33:59Z,,551-557,,6,11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 0</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,the effect of empathy on human-agent interaction,the effect of empathy on humanagent interaction

,,,,,,,,,,Artificial Intelligence and Medical Humanities,"The use of artificial intelligence in healthcare has led to debates about the role of human clinicians in the increasingly technological contexts of medicine. Some researchers have argued that AI will augment the capacities of physicians and increase their availability to provide empathy and other uniquely human forms of care to their patients. The human vulnerabilities experienced in the healthcare context raise the stakes of new technologies such as AI, and the human dimensions of AI in healthcare have particular significance for research in the humanities. This article explains four key areas of concern relating to AI and the role that medical/health humanities research can play in addressing them: definition and regulation of “medical” versus “health” data and apps; social determinants of health; narrative medicine; and technological mediation of care. Issues include data privacy and trust, flawed datasets and algorithmic bias, racial discrimination, and the rhetoric of humanism and disability. Through a discussion of potential humanities contributions to these emerging intersections with AI, this article will suggest future scholarly directions for the field. © 2020, The Author(s).",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2020,"Ostherr, K.",Journal of Medical Humanities,,,REX3BB4I,10.1007/s10912-020-09636-4,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088927968&doi=10.1007%2fs10912-020-09636-4&partnerID=40&md5=53ea81de6d941d02b11180d7678fa092,2020-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:33:59Z,2021-02-15T22:33:59Z,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 0</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,artificial intelligence and medical humanities,artificial intelligence and medical humanities

While the main purpose of deploying robots has been productivity improvement, the current COVID-19 pandemic has brought more urgent purpose, providing contactless service for social distancing. This study explores the service quality provided by robots based on real data in a hotel setting. A sample of 201 guests provided their expected service quality by robots and the actual performance experience after the service. We analyzed this relationship using importance performance analysis (IPA) and the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). The results revealed that customers’ top priorities for robots’ service quality are assurance and reliability, while tangible and empathy were not as important. Customers were not satisfied with robots’ responsiveness, but this construct was found to be a low priority. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2020,"Chiang, A.-H.; Trimi, S.",Service Business,,,KXVJ77TF,10.1007/s11628-020-00423-8,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089085301&doi=10.1007%2fs11628-020-00423-8&partnerID=40&md5=845fde74db3c352ab9c164b287bcc23f,2020-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:33:59Z,2021-02-15T22:33:59Z,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 1</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,impacts of service robots on service quality,impacts of service robots on service quality

Part I briefly describes some of the ways AI is already in use in ordinary life-from facial recognition, through medical diagnosis to translation services. Part II describes how AI is transforming what it means to provide legal services in six primary areas: Litigation review; expertise automation; legal research; contract analytics; contract and litigation document generation; and predictive analytics. Part III explores who are the providers of these AI driven legal services-often non-lawyer legal service providers-and how these providers are replacing at least some of what clients have traditionally sought from lawyers. Part III also discusses the implications of all these changes both for the future role of lawyers individually, and in particular what services will clients still need lawyers to perform: Judgment, empathy, creativity and adaptability. In turn, this Part examines what will these changes mean for the size, shape, composition and economic model of law firms, as well as the implications of these changes for legal education and lawyer training. Part IV identifies the principal legal, ethical, regulatory and risk management issues raised by the use of AI in the provision of legal services. Finally, in Part V the article considers who will be the likely providers of AI based services other than law firms: Legal publishers, major accounting firms and venture capital funded businesses. © 2020 Fundacao Getulio Vargas, Escola de Direito de Sao Paulo.

What are the risks and trade-offs of pre-delegating military force (or automating escalation) to machines? How might non-nuclear state and non-state actors leverage AI to put pressure on nuclear states? This article analyzes the impact of strategic stability of the use of AI in the strategic decision-making process, in particular, the risks and trade-offs of pre-delegating military force (or automating escalation) to machines. It argues that AI-enabled decision support tools, by substituting the role of human critical thinking, empathy, creativity, and intuition in the strategic decision-making process, will be fundamentally destabilizing if defense planners come to view AI’s ‘support’ function as a panacea for the cognitive fallibilities and human analysis and decision-making. The article also considers the nefarious use of AI-enhanced fake news, deepfakes, bots, and other forms of social media by non-state actors and state proxy actors, which might cause states to exaggerate a threat from ambiguous or manipulated information, increasing instability. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2020,"Johnson, J.",Journal of Strategic Studies,,,VXKMY2Y5,10.1080/01402390.2020.1759038,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85084253030&doi=10.1080%2f01402390.2020.1759038&partnerID=40&md5=6b22890c802c9b5864b40f003515f307,2020-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:33:59Z,2021-02-15T22:33:59Z,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 2</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,delegating strategic decision-making to machines: dr. strangelove redux?,delegating strategic decisionmaking to machines dr strangelove redux

To reduce this complexity, IoT platforms provide a set of resources and functionalities to enable application development and support its execution. In this work, we present a human-centered approach for requirements elicitation and mapping them to application resources in IoT platforms, using empathy, definition and ideation methods. A previous study by the authors has identified 11 categories of resources provided by 47 IoT platforms to developers in their application layers. From this set, 6 categories were selected for this work: schedulers and triggers, message and notification triggers, big data and analytics, artificial intelligence and machine learning, dashboards, and services. We invited 18 members of 8 projects for a workshop and divided them in 4 teams, according their project areas, which are: Industry 4.0 (6 participants), Environmental Disasters (4 participants), Environmental Management (3 participants) and Pollution (5 participants). We divided the workshop in 3 phases: warm-up, with user journey mapping, requirements identification using “how might we” questions as a trigger and requirements clustering the questions by the 6 selected categories of resources or an extra category named “others” for those which could not be related to any previous category. Our contribution for the IoT application development is an approach for turning easier requirements elicitation using DT techniques, covering the stages of empathise, definition and ideation, with well-available materials and considering the resources present at application layer of IoT platforms. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2020,"Lima Dantas, D.; Filgueiras, L.V.L.; Brandão, A.A.F.; Machado Domingues, M.C.; Ferreira, M.R.",Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),,,J5K2PRFU,10.1007/978-3-030-50344-4_7,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088740148&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-50344-4_7&partnerID=40&md5=82f5cd968cdecbc941b929dd7ba6216c,2020-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:33:59Z,2021-02-15T22:33:59Z,,85-100,,,12203 LNCS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 0</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,detecting iot applications opportunities and requirements elicitation: a design thinking based approach,detecting iot applications opportunities and requirements elicitation a design thinking based approach
,,,,,,,,,,"An Essay on Narrative, Reality, and Imagination","Narrative is a verbal account, a story of related events which can be factual, fictional or both. Life experience and imagination are as essential to narrative as narrative is to mankind. The phylogenic perspective of literature suggests an inborn capacity for empathy, intelligence and inventiveness, whereas the ontological example is variable. Western knowledge, politics and ethics have evolved from their narrative of Greek myth, epic and drama, the few medieval writers, singularly by the Elizabethan theater, importantly the Arthurian legend and romance stories, English and Russian novels, and uniquely the American short story. This heritage progressively demarcated such life themes as the hero, maiden and adversary; love, hate and indifference; loyalty, deception and betrayal; desire, achievement and loss. These characterizations of self and other remain relevant to the contemporary novel, cinema/TV, and theater, as well as the news, commentary, and real life. Conversely, postmodern assumptions challenge that individual subjectivity determines what is real, valid or authentic, consequently the relativism of traditional, institutional and historical precedents of the truth. Further, the computer, gaming, smart device, and artificial intelligence have changed the content and function of customary narrative. Nonetheless, narrative — real and imagined, ancient and new — retains the meaning of a story about connected events which variously transcends the boundaries of difference. ©, Copyright © Melvin Bornstein, Joseph Lichtenberg, Donald Silver.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2019,"Bristol, R.C.",Psychoanalytic Inquiry,,,BS8HS2CZ,10.1080/07351690.2019.1659025,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85074169447&doi=10.1080%2f07351690.2019.1659025&partnerID=40&md5=e63ea1dc96732323847d76ffb96ead71,2019-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:34:00Z,2021-02-15T22:34:00Z,,476-484,,7,39,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 1</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,"an essay on narrative, reality, and imagination",an essay on narrative reality and imagination

However, its own development is encountering bottlenecks that it is unable to implement empathy with human emotions. So affective computing is getting more attention from researchers. In this paper, we propose an amygdala-inspired affective computing framework to realize the recognition of all kinds of human personalized emotions. Similar to the amygdala, the instantaneous emergency emotion is first computed more quickly in a low-redundancy convolutional neural network compressed by pruning and weight sharing with hashing trick. Then, the real-time process emotion is identified more accurately by the memory level neural networks, which is good at handling time-related signals. Finally, the intracranial emotion is recognized in personalized hidden Markov models. We demonstrate on Facial Expression of Emotion Dataset and the recognition accuracy of external emotions (including the emergency emotion and the process emotion) reached 85.72%.

It is precisely in the EU where there is a special commitment to developing an ethics for a trustworthy AI in design and made in Europe, to position itself in front of United States and especially China, two countries that don’t pay much attention to the issue. Firstly, we describe the content of ethics of AI and its essential principles from the point of view of the dignity and rights; second, we describe the main five principles contained in the international declarations. Third, we include other basic principles which arise from the demands of empathy with humans. From a somewhat sceptical perspective, we argue the potential utilities of ethics of AI for the law: it is considered to be an especially preventive instrument and that an ethical governance of AI can be developed, following the examples of policies and frameworks on public ethics and institutional integrity.

,,,,,,,,,,The 3S process: A framework for teaching AI strategy in business education,"A gap has emerged in teaching artificial intelligence (AI) in business education, where a style of curriculum based on strategy is missing. This article presents a new framework, the 3S Process, as a method for teaching leaders how to strategically adopt AI within their organizations. At a high-level, the 3S Process consists of three stages (Story, Strategy, and Solution), which are described in detail in the article. Stage 1: Story in the process is inspired by the Harvard Case Method to provide context for a problem. Stage 2: Strategy uses Design Thinking to produce candidate solutions. The substage of Empathy in Design Thinking plays a crucial role to reduce bias in designing AI. Virtualization technology is a tool for students to experience hands-on learning in prototype development. Stage 3: Solution is where students advocate for their conceptual AI solution in the context of the case study. AI is a type of complex system; therefore, students should consider feedback loops and the potential for unintended biases to enter a deployed solution. The presentation of the 3S Process in this article is conceptual. Further empirical studies, including evaluations of the 3S Process in classroom settings, will be considered in the future. © 2019 Carleton University.

,,,,,,,,,,A virtual counseling application using artificial intelligence for communication skills training in nursing education: Development study,"Background: The ability of nursing undergraduates to communicate effectively with health care providers, patients, and their family members is crucial to their nursing professions as these can affect patient outcomes. However, the traditional use of didactic lectures for communication skills training is ineffective, and the use of standardized patients is not time- or cost-effective. Given the abilities of virtual patients (VPs) to simulate interactive and authentic clinical scenarios in secured environments with unlimited training attempts, a virtual counseling application is an ideal platform for nursing students to hone their communication skills before their clinical postings. Objective: The aim of this study was to develop and test the use of VPs to better prepare nursing undergraduates for communicating with real-life patients, their family members, and other health care professionals during their clinical postings. Methods: The stages of the creation of VPs included preparation, design, and development, followed by a testing phase before the official implementation. An initial voice chatbot was trained using a natural language processing engine, Google Cloud's Dialogflow, and was later visualized into a three-dimensional (3D) avatar form using Unity 3D. Results: The VPs included four case scenarios that were congruent with the nursing undergraduates' semesters' learning objectives: (1) assessing the pain experienced by a pregnant woman, (2) taking the history of a depressed patient, (3) escalating a bleeding episode of a postoperative patient to a physician, and (4) showing empathy to a stressed-out fellow final-year nursing student. Challenges arose in terms of content development, technological limitations, and expectations management, which can be resolved by contingency planning, open communication, constant program updates, refinement, and training. Conclusions: The creation of VPs to assist in nursing students' communication skills training may provide authentic learning environments that enhance students' perceived self-efficacy and confidence in effective communication skills. However, given the infancy stage of this project, further refinement and constant enhancements are needed to train the VPs to simulate real-life conversations before the official implementation. © Shefaly Shorey, Emily Ang, John Yap, Esperanza Debby Ng, Siew Tiang Lau, Chee Kong Chui.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2019,"Shorey, S.; Ang, E.; Yap, J.; Ng, E.D.; Lau, S.T.; Chui, C.K.",Journal of Medical Internet Research,,,DS75ZP5V,10.2196/14658,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85074280727&doi=10.2196%2f14658&partnerID=40&md5=7a03884a7f18dacaff1c265fa63f57a2,2019-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:34:01Z,2021-02-15T22:34:01Z,,,,10,21,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 6</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,a virtual counseling application using artificial intelligence for communication skills training in nursing education: development study,a virtual counseling application using artificial intelligence for communication skills training in nursing education development study

The medical students of today will practice in a world where information technology is sophisticated and omnipresent. In this world, the tasks of memorization and analysis will be less important to them as practicing physicians. On the other hand, the nonanalytical, humanistic aspects of medicine-most importantly, the art of caring-will remain a critical function of the physician, and facility with improving systems of care will be required. Communication, empathy, shared decision making, leadership, team building, and creativity are all skills that will continue to gain importance for physicians.

In fact, not only is it becoming apparent that quantum processes may regularly take place in biological systems, but these processes may underlie the mechanisms of consciousness and propel our models of conceptualizing the human brain into the next era of scientific understanding. The phenomena of consciousness have allured scientists and philosophers for thousands of years, while a precise technical understanding has remained elusive. If possible, developing this understanding will likely be one of humanity's greatest achievements. Knowing the fundamental processes that create conscious experience has far-reaching implications, from the potential birth of true artificial intelligence to a better understanding of mental health disorder etiologies and treatments. One major challenge in the mental health professions, and, ultimately, in empathy of any kind, is being able to see from and appreciate another person's unique, subjective experience.

To answer this, we created a three-way discussion setting between a participant and two artificial agents: One agent took the same opinion as a participant while the other did the opposite. This resulted in a feeling of group identity between the participant and the first agent, i.e. the same side. This feeling of group identity was shown to be detected using error-related negativity (ERN), a component of an event-related potential that accompanies errors in speeded performance. We found that amplitude of ERN was bigger for the same side agent’s failure than for the other side’s. We also found ERN difference correlated to an empathy ability detected by a questionnaire. From these results, we can say that a person can form an in-group relation between an artificial agent, which can be detected by ERN. © 2016, Japanese Society for Artificial Intelligence.

However, the current systems always generate the same or limited forms of backchannels every time, giving a monotonous impression. This study investigates the generation of a variety of backchannel forms appropriate for the dialogue context, using the corpus of counseling dialogue. At first, we annotate all acceptable backchannel form categories considering the permissible variation in backchannels. Second, we analyze how the morphological form of backchannels relates to linguistic features of the preceding utterance such as the utterance boundary type and the linguistic complexity. Based on this analysis, we conduct machine learning to predict backchannel form from the linguistic and prosodic features of the preceding context. This model outperformed a baseline which always outputs the same form of backchannels and another baseline which randomly generates backchannels. Finally, subjective evaluations by human listeners show that the proposed method generates backchannels more naturally and gives a feeling of understanding and empathy. © 2016, Transactions of the Japanese Society for Artificial Intelligence.

Artificial emotions is still an emergent field in artificial intelligence, so we devote some space in this paper in order to explain what they are and how we can have an machine able to recognize and mimic basic emotions. We argue that empathy is the key emotion in healthcare contexts. We discuss what empathy is and how it can be modeled to include it in a medical machine. We consider types of medical machines (telemedicine, care robots and mobile apps), and describe the main machines that are in use and offer some predictions about what the near future may bring. The main ethical problems we consider in machine medical ethics are: privacy violations (due to online patient databases), how to deal with error and responsibility concerning machine decisions and actions, social inequality (as a result of people being removed from an e-healthcare system), and how to build trust between machines, patients, and medical professionals. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2015,"Vallverdú, J.; Casacuberta, D.","Intelligent Systems, Control and Automation: Science and Engineering",,,SM73UZ9B,10.1007/978-3-319-08108-3_20,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84921448800&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-319-08108-3_20&partnerID=40&md5=a10a06e28a6b500f117c166167fc864e,2015-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:34:02Z,2021-02-15T22:34:02Z,,341-362,,,74,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 4</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,ethical and technical aspects of emotions to create empathy in medical machines,ethical and technical aspects of emotions to create empathy in medical machines
,,,,,,,,,,Compassion and prosocial behavior. Is it possible to simulate them virtually?,"In the field of artificial intelligence, a question dealing with computer and cognitive science is arising and becoming more and more crucial: Can we design agents so sophisticated that they are capable of mimicking emotional behaviors in general as well as specific emotions like compassion or empathy? Despite the production of different computational models, their integration with cognitive and psychological theories remains a central problem. Reasons are both methodological and theoretical. Primarily, it is difficult to quantify the impact of such factors as individual differences, inclinations and personality traits. In addition, Agent-Based Models (ABMs) often use linear dynamics, even in describing emotions, without considering the basis of psychophysics. Bearing in mind this and focusing on compassion as a particular emotion, the paper aims to present a “Decalogue” for those interested in designing agents capable of mimicking human emotional behaviors. In the paper, compassion will be translated as prosocial behavior. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2015,"Ceschi, A.; Scalco, A.; Dickert, S.; Sartori, R.",Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,,,QLIHZWYJ,10.1007/978-3-319-19629-9_23,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84946410442&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-319-19629-9_23&partnerID=40&md5=1d820a863bf587f7f0f85fe86d00561e,2015-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:34:02Z,2021-02-15T22:34:02Z,,207-214,,,372,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 7</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,compassion and prosocial behavior. is it possible to simulate them virtually?,compassion and prosocial behavior is it possible to simulate them virtually

Our work aims at recovering the lost contact with animals in the urban context, taking advantage of biophilic empathy. The parameters governing the robotised elements we propose are mainly qualitative (emotions and aesthetical perception), which cannot easily be described by mathematical parameters. Additionally, due to their complexity, it is often impossible –or at least impractical, to hardcode suitable controllers for such structures. Thus, we propose the use of Artificial Intelligence learning techniques, concretely Evolutionary Algorithms, to allow the user to teach the robotised components how to behave in response to their resemblance to specific animal behaviors. This idea is tested on an intelligent fa¸cade that learns optimal configurations according to the perception of aggressiveness and calmness. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2015,"Gil, P.; Rossi, C.; Coral, W.",Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),,,8EIQDB4F,10.1007/978-3-319-22979-9_47,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84947104679&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-319-22979-9_47&partnerID=40&md5=906ff7465fc2103a0556f85aed9a7a97,2015-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:34:02Z,2021-02-15T22:34:02Z,,465-472,,,9222,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 1</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,biophilic evolutionary buildings that restore the experience of animality in the city,biophilic evolutionary buildings that restore the experience of animality in the city
,,,,,,,,,,Artificial intelligence and society: A furtive transformation,"During the 1950s, there was a burst of enthusiasm about whether artificial intelligence might surpass human intelligence. Since then, technology has changed society so dramatically that the focus of study has shifted toward society's ability to adapt to technological change. Technology and rapid communications weaken the capacity of society to integrate into the broader social structure those people who have had little or no access to education. (Most of the recent use of communications by the excluded has been disruptive, not integrative.) Interweaving of socioeconomic activity and large-scale systems had a dehumanizing effect on people excluded from social participation by these trends. Jobs vanish at an accelerating rate. Marketing creates demand for goods which stress the global environment, even while the global environment no longer yields readily accessible resources. Mining and petroleum firms push into ever more challenging environments (e. g., deep mines and seabed mining) to meet resource demands. These activities are expensive, and resource prices rise rapidly, further excluding groups that cannot pay for these resources. The impact of large-scale systems on society leads to mass idleness, with the accompanying threat of violent reaction as unemployed masses seek to blame both people in power as well as the broader social structure for their plight. Perhaps, the impact of large-scale systems on society has already eroded essential qualities of humanness. Humans, when they feel ""socially useless,"" are dehumanized. (At the same time, machines (at any scale) seem incapable of emotion or empathy.) Has the cost of technological progress been too high to pay?

Main symptoms include motion disorders and stereotyped behaviors. This paper presents an approach based on Artificial Intelligence techniques and Ambient Intelligence technologies for the detection of stereotyped motion disorders of patients with ASD. Specifically, monitoring is realized by means of tri-axis accelerometers applied to the patient's wrists. Signals obtained by accelerometers are pre-processed to obtain features that, in turn, are passed to classifiers that classifies the current observation in order to detect stereotyped motions.

,,,,,,,,,,Empathy and Instrumentalization: Late Ancient Cultural Critique and the Challenge of Apparently Personal Robots,"According to a tradition that we hold variously today, the relational person lives most personally in affective and cognitive empathy, whereby we enter subjective communion with another person. Near future social AIs, including social robots, will give us this experience without possessing any subjectivity of their own. They will also be consumer products, designed to be subservient instruments of their users' satisfaction. This would seem inevitable. Yet we cannot live as personal when caught between instrumentalizing apparent persons (slaveholding) or numbly dismissing the apparent personalities of our instruments (mild sociopathy). This paper analyzes and proposes a step toward ameliorating this dilemma by way of the thought of a 5th century North African philosopher and theologian, Augustine of Hippo, who is among those essential in giving us our understanding of relational persons. Augustine's semiotics, deeply intertwined with our affective life, suggest that, if we are to own persuasive social robots humanely, we must join our instinctive experience of empathy for them to an empathic acknowledgment of the real unknown relational persons whose emails, text messages, books, and bodily movements will have provided the training data for the behavior of near-future social AIs. So doing, we may see simulation as simulation (albeit persuasive), while expanding our empathy to include those whose refracted behavioral moments are the seedbed of this simulation. If we naïvely stop at the social robot as the ultimate object of our cognitive and affective empathy, we will suborn the sign to ourselves, undermining rather than sustaining a culture that prizes empathy and abhors the instrumentalization of persons. © 2020 The authors and IOS Press.

,,,,,,,,,,The Growing Need for Reliable Conceptual Analysis in HRI Studies: The Example of the Term 'Empathy',"Due to its interdisciplinary nature, the field of HRI uses many concepts typical of the social sciences and humanities, in addition to terms that are usually associated with technology. In this paper, I analyse the problems that arise when we use the term âempathy' to describe and explain the interaction between robots and humans. I argue that this not only raises questions about the possibility of applying this term in situations in which only one of the participants of the interaction is a traditionally understood social subject but also requires answers to questions about such problematic concepts as values and culture. © 2020 The authors and IOS Press.

,,,,,,,,,,"Differential facial articulacy in robots and humans elicit different levels of responsiveness, empathy, and projected feelings","Life-like humanoid robots are on the rise, aiming at communicative purposes that resemble humanlike conversation. In human social interaction, the facial expression serves important communicative functions. We examined whether a robot’s face is similarly important in human-robot communication. Based on emotion research and neuropsychological insights on the parallel processing of emotions, we argue that greater plasticity in the robot’s face elicits higher affective responsivity, more closely resembling human-to-human responsiveness than a more static face. We conducted a between-subjects experiment of 3 (facial plasticity: human vs. facially flexible robot vs. facially static robot) × 2 (treatment: affectionate vs. maltreated). Participants (N = 265; Mage = 31.5) were measured for their emotional responsiveness, empathy, and attribution of feelings to the robot. Results showed empathically and emotionally less intensive responsivity toward the robots than toward the human but followed similar patterns. Significantly different intensities of feelings and attributions (e.g., pain upon maltreatment) followed facial articulacy. Theoretical implications for underlying processes in human-robot communication are discussed. We theorize that precedence of emotion and affect over cognitive reflection, which are processed in parallel, triggers the experience of ‘because I feel, I believe it’s real,’ despite being aware of communicating with a robot. By evoking emotional responsiveness, the cognitive awareness of ‘it is just a robot’ fades into the background and appears not relevant anymore. © 2020 by the authors.

,,,,,,,,,,Ordered interpersonal synchronisation in ASD children via robots,"Children with autistic spectrum disorders (ASD) experience persistent disrupted coordination in interpersonal synchronisation that is thought to be associated with deficits in neural connectivity. Robotic interventions have been explored for use with ASD children worldwide revealing that robots encourage one-to-one social and emotional interactions. However, associations between interpersonal synchronisation and emotional empathy have not yet been directly explored in French and Japanese ASD children when they interact with a human or a robot under analogous experimental conditions. Using the paradigm of actor-perceiver, where the child was the actor and the robot or the human the perceiver, we recorded the autonomic heart rate activation and reported emotional feelings of ASD children in both countries. Japanese and French ASD children showed different interpersonal synchronisation when they interacted with the human perceiver, even though the human was the same in both countries. However, they exhibited similar interpersonal synchronisation when the perceiver was the robot. The findings suggest that the mechanism combining interpersonal synchronisation and emotional empathy might be weakened but not absent in ASD children and that both French and Japanese ASD children do spontaneously and unconsciously discern non verbal actions of non human partners through a direct matching process that occurs via automatic mapping. © 2020, The Author(s).",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2020,"Giannopulu, I.; Etournaud, A.; Terada, K.; Velonaki, M.; Watanabe, T.",Scientific Reports,,,INAJJCKA,10.1038/s41598-020-74438-6,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85092659030&doi=10.1038%2fs41598-020-74438-6&partnerID=40&md5=ba25cca4d93dfcc0d9b69aa2ee0148d5,2020-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:35:16Z,2021-02-15T22:35:16Z,,,,1,10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 0</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,ordered interpersonal synchronisation in asd children via robots,ordered interpersonal synchronisation in asd children via robots
,,,,,,,,,,Alexithymic personality in Philip K. Dick’s Do androids dream of electric sheep?,"The official definition for alexithymia dates back to 1973, when Sifneos described its symptoms. Persons affected by this condition are unable to verbally describe their feelings. For many years this condition was relatively little known, but nowadays people are talking about it more and more. In forums in which the patients’ comments are posted, it is often underscored how this particular mental state is similar to that of the androids described in the novel Do androids dream of electric sheep? by Philip K. Dick. The Dickian clinical references were those in use during the 1960s. Therefore, to special characteristics that Philip Dick attributed to his robots (coldness and lack of human empathy, and simultaneous desire for social acceptance), the writer, and then the critics, assigned the label of schizophrenia, the only one that the psychiatric manuals of that time associated to such symptoms. Today, if Dick were alive and were to write about his androids, he most likely would no longer use the term schizophrenics, but instead the term alexithymics, which are more socially adaptive than schizophrenics, just like his androids. Making retrospective diagnoses of literary characters is anachronistic; as it was done for decades by critics to consider the Dickian androids schizophrenics: in the fiction story they are not schizophrenics but robots. However a new psychological trait such as alexithymia can revisit that same story by giving it a new symbolic meaning. The aims of this article are: to highlight how the old nosological categories of schizophrenia, generally referred to when commenting Do androids dream of electric sheep?, should be supplemented by the category of alexithymia; to analyze the scenes in which the characters have typical alexithymic behaviors, trying to prove that alexithymia is actually best suited for describing the androids invented by Dick. © 2020, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2020,"Gramantieri, R.",Neohelicon,,,SAPE98PC,10.1007/s11059-020-00544-z,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85086745112&doi=10.1007%2fs11059-020-00544-z&partnerID=40&md5=d7ae68506033a119722c578a57aa02bd,2020-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:35:17Z,2021-02-15T22:35:17Z,,673-683,,2,47,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 0</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,alexithymic personality in philip k. dick’s do androids dream of electric sheep?,alexithymic personality in philip k dicks do androids dream of electric sheep
,,,,,,,,,,An autonomous cognitive empathy model responsive to users' facial emotion expressions,"Successful social robot services depend on how robots can interact with users. The effective service can be obtained through smooth, engaged, and humanoid interactions in which robots react properly to a user's affective state. This article proposes a novel Automatic Cognitive Empathy Model, ACEM, for humanoid robots to achieve longer and more engaged human-robot interactions (HRI) by considering humans' emotions and replying to them appropriately. The proposed model continuously detects the affective states of a user based on facial expressions and generates desired, either parallel or reactive, empathic behaviors that are already adapted to the user's personality. Users' affective states are detected using a stacked autoencoder network that is trained and tested on the RAVDESS dataset. The overall proposed empathic model is verified throughout an experiment, where different emotions are triggered in participants and then empathic behaviors are applied based on proposed hypothesis. The results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed model in terms of related social and friendship concepts that participants perceived during interaction with the robot. © 2020 ACM.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2020,"Bagheri, E.; Esteban, P.G.; Cao, H.-L.; Beir, A.D.; Lefeber, D.; Vanderborght, B.",ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems,,,VHEYS5UH,10.1145/3341198,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097225306&doi=10.1145%2f3341198&partnerID=40&md5=6b3056773f580546273a9ec06bea4681,2020-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:35:17Z,2021-02-15T22:35:17Z,,,,3,10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 0</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,an autonomous cognitive empathy model responsive to users' facial emotion expressions,an autonomous cognitive empathy model responsive to users facial emotion expressions

However, a proper integration of IHRs requires a detailed description and explanation of their essential capabilities, particularly regarding their competencies in replicating and portraying emotive functions such as empathy. Existing humanoid robots can exhibit rudimentary forms of empathy; as these machines slowly become commonplace in healthcare settings, they will be expected to express empathy as a natural function, rather than merely to portray artificial empathy as a replication of human empathy. This article works with a twofold purpose: firstly, to consider the impact of artificial empathy in nursing and, secondly, to describe the influence of Affective Developmental Robotics (ADR) in anticipation of the empathic behaviour presented by artificial humanoid robots. The ADR has demonstrated that it can be one means by which humanoid nurse robots can achieve expressions of more relatable artificial empathy. This will be one of the vital models for intelligent humanoid robots currently in nurse robot development for the healthcare industry. A discussion of IHRs demonstrating artificial empathy is critical to nursing practice today, particularly in healthcare settings dense with technology. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2020,"Pepito, J.A.; Ito, H.; Betriana, F.; Tanioka, T.; Locsin, R.C.",Nursing Philosophy,,,4LQ2P4BM,10.1111/nup.12318,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088269058&doi=10.1111%2fnup.12318&partnerID=40&md5=9764df20ca03d74991df8a514f7e7133,2020-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:35:17Z,2021-02-15T22:35:17Z,,,,4,21,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 1</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,intelligent humanoid robots expressing artificial humanlike empathy in nursing situations,intelligent humanoid robots expressing artificial humanlike empathy in nursing situations
,,,,,,,,,,Embodiment matters: toward culture-specific robotized counselling,"In this paper, we propose adding the traditional Japanese nodding behavior to the repertoire of social movements to be used in the context of human–robot interaction. Our approach is motivated by the notion that in many cultures, trust-building can be boosted by small body gestures. We discuss the integration of a robot capable of such movements within CRECA, our context-respectful counseling agent. The frequent nodding called “unazuki” in Japan, often accompanying the “un-un” sound (meaning “I agree”) of Japanese onomatopoeia, underlines empathy and embodies unconditioned approval. We argue that “unazuki” creates more empathy and promotes longer conversation between the robotic counsellor and people. We set up an experiment involving ten subjects to verify these effects. Our quantitative evaluation is based on the classic metrics of utterance, adapted to support the Japanese language. Interactions featuring “unazuki” showed higher value of this metrics. Moreover, subjects assessed the counselling robot’s trustworthiness and kindness as “very high” (Likert scale: 5.5 versus 3—4.5) showing the effect of social gestures in promoting empathetic dialogue to general people including the younger generation. Our findings support the importance of social movements when using robotized agents as a therapeutic tool aimed at improving emotional state and social interactions, with unambiguous evidence that embodiment can have a positive impact that warrants further exploration.

,,,,,,,,,,Are future professionals willing to implement service robots? Attitudes of hospitality and tourism students towards service robotization,"This paper aims to examine attitudes of hospitality and tourism students, as future professionals, towards willingness to implement service robots. The study proposes a new theoretical conceptual model that includes new constructs and items, differentiating it from the others. The model was formed based on the extensive literature review and the interview with an eight-member focus group (hotel managers and academic researchers). Data collection was performed in two stages, pilot research based on 82 respondents and the main study, with the final number of respondents being 236. The initial results of the exploratory factor analysis were further tested using the confirmatory factor analysis. After the exclusion of several items due to low factor loadings and in order to improve model validity, analyses further suggested a nine-dimensional solution with 45 items. The study findings reveal a positive relationship between seven constructs and students’ willingness to implement service robots, with the expected business outcome being the most influencing one.

,,,,,,,,,,The role of personality factors and empathy in the acceptance and performance of a social robot for psychometric evaluations,"Research and development in socially assistive robotics have produced several novel applications in the care of senior people. However, some are still unexplored such as their use as psychometric tools allowing for a quick and dependable evaluation of human users' intellectual capacity. To fully exploit the application of a social robot as a psychometric tool, it is necessary to account for the users' factors that might influence the interaction with a robot and the evaluation of user cognitive performance. To this end, we invited senior participants to use a prototype of a robot-led cognitive test and analyzed the influence of personality traits and user's empathy on the cognitive performance and technology acceptance. Results show a positive influence of a personality trait, the ""openness to experience"", on the human-robot interaction, and that other factors, such as anxiety, trust, and intention to use, are influencing technology acceptance and correlate the evaluation by psychometric tests. © 2020 by the authors.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2020,"Rossi, S.; Conti, D.; Garramone, F.; Santangelo, G.; Staffa, M.; Varrasi, S.; Di Nuovo, A.",Robotics,,,72X8ATSE,10.3390/ROBOTICS9020039,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85086668483&doi=10.3390%2fROBOTICS9020039&partnerID=40&md5=c2ec5388361d460022f6c3d10f29ebcb,2020-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:35:17Z,2021-02-15T22:35:17Z,,,,2,9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 1</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,the role of personality factors and empathy in the acceptance and performance of a social robot for psychometric evaluations,the role of personality factors and empathy in the acceptance and performance of a social robot for psychometric evaluations
,,,,,,,,,,Robot Enhanced Therapy for Autistic Children: An Ethical Analysis,"The use of social robots has been proposed for the delivery of therapy to autistic children. The aim of such projects, of which the DREAM project is an example, is to replace therapists by robots, operating in sensory environments that enable them to detect and respond to feedback from the child. This article considers the ethical concerns of autonomy, community, transparency, identity, value, and empathy to evaluate the ethics of such deployment of robots. In doing so it provides a response to the Richardson et al. article in <italic>IEEE Technology and Society Magazine</italic>, Mar. 2018 [20]. This article concludes that deployment of robots to control the behavior of autistic children is ethically suspect and should be questioned. The use of robots with children should be evaluated on the basis of the purpose of and process by which such robots are deployed, rather than on the basis of the technology itself. Particularly important is the roboticist's empathy with the user of the robot, and gaining an understanding of the individual child. The paper suggests how an understanding of the autistic child might lead to sensitive deployment of a robot to help the child manage social environments through supporting the child's regulation of emotions. © 1982-2012 IEEE.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2020,"McBride, N.",IEEE Technology and Society Magazine,,,M4E9Q4MQ,10.1109/MTS.2020.2967493,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85082031020&doi=10.1109%2fMTS.2020.2967493&partnerID=40&md5=7ee555189c1a7a2bf1f6ae1bc24dce07,2020-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:35:18Z,2021-02-15T22:35:18Z,,51-60,,1,39,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 1</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,robot enhanced therapy for autistic children: an ethical analysis,robot enhanced therapy for autistic children an ethical analysis
,,,,,,,,,,"Exploring Teens as Robot Operators, Users and Witnesses in the Wild","As social robots continue to show promise as assistive technologies, the exploration of appropriate and impactful robot behaviors is key to their eventual success. Teens are a unique population given their vulnerability to stress leading to both mental and physical illness. Much of teen stress stems from school, making the school environment an ideal location for a stress reducing technology. The goal of this mixed-methods study was to understand teens' operation of, and responsiveness to, a robot only capable of movement compared to a robot only capable of speech. Stemming from a human-centered approach, we introduce a Participatory Wizard of Oz (PWoz) interaction method that engaged teens as operators, users, and witnesses in a uniquely transparent interaction. In this paper, we illustrate the use of the PWoz interaction method as well as how it helps identify engaging robot interactions. Using this technique, we present results from a study with 62 teens that includes details of the complexity of teen stress and a significant reduction in negative attitudes toward robots after interactions. We analyzed the teens' interactions with both the verbal and non-verbal robots and identified strong themes of (1) authenticity, (2) empathy, (3) emotional engagement, and (4) imperfection creates connection. Finally, we reflect on the benefits and limitations of the PWoz method and our study to identify next steps toward the design and development of our social robot. © Copyright © 2020 Björling, Thomas, Rose and Cakmak.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2020,"Björling, E.A.; Thomas, K.; Rose, E.J.; Cakmak, M.",Frontiers in Robotics and AI,,,DLDCYDG7,10.3389/frobt.2020.00005,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85081700133&doi=10.3389%2ffrobt.2020.00005&partnerID=40&md5=b3727eb4331051d6aa27b67a53ab255c,2020-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:35:18Z,2021-02-15T22:35:18Z,,,,,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 1</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,"exploring teens as robot operators, users and witnesses in the wild",exploring teens as robot operators users and witnesses in the wild
,,,,,,,,,,A Reinforcement Learning Based Cognitive Empathy Framework for Social Robots,"Robots that express human’s social norms, like empathy, are perceived as more friendly, understanding, and caring. However, appropriate human-like empathic behaviors cannot be defined in advance, instead, they must be learned through daily interaction with humans in different situations. Additionally, to learn and apply the correct behaviors, robots must be able to perceive and understand the affective states of humans. This study presents a framework to enable cognitive empathy in social robots, which uses facial emotion recognition to perceive and understand the affective states of human users. The perceived affective state is then provided to a reinforcement learning model to enable a robot to learn the most appropriate empathic behaviors for different states. The proposed framework has been evaluated through an experiment between 28 individual humans and the humanoid robot Pepper. The results show that by applying empathic behaviors selected by the employed learning model, the robot is able to provide participants comfort and confidence and help them enjoy and feel better. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2020,"Bagheri, E.; Roesler, O.; Cao, H.-L.; Vanderborght, B.",International Journal of Social Robotics,,,6MB2U92P,10.1007/s12369-020-00683-4,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85091144365&doi=10.1007%2fs12369-020-00683-4&partnerID=40&md5=f3b6bad671fdea58d1e7adfee9eb2754,2020-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:35:18Z,2021-02-15T22:35:18Z,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 0</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,a reinforcement learning based cognitive empathy framework for social robots,a reinforcement learning based cognitive empathy framework for social robots
,,,,,,,,,,Empathetic Speech Synthesis and Testing for Healthcare Robots,"One of the major factors that affect the acceptance of robots in Human-Robot Interaction applications is the type of voice with which they interact with humans. The robot’s voice can be used to express empathy, which is an affective response of the robot to the human user. In this study, the aim is to find out if social robots with empathetic voice are acceptable for users in healthcare applications. A pilot study using an empathetic voice spoken by a voice actor was conducted. Only prosody in speech is used to express empathy here, without any visual cues. Also, the emotions needed for an empathetic voice are identified. It was found that the emotions needed are not only the stronger primary emotions, but also the nuanced secondary emotions. These emotions are then synthesised using prosody modelling. A second study, replicating the pilot test is conducted using the synthesised voices to investigate if empathy is perceived from the synthetic voice as well. This paper reports the modelling and synthesises of an empathetic voice, and experimentally shows that people prefer empathetic voice for healthcare robots. The results can be further used to develop empathetic social robots, that can improve people’s acceptance of social robots. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2020,"James, J.; Balamurali, B.T.; Watson, C.I.; MacDonald, B.",International Journal of Social Robotics,,,YU9LKP23,10.1007/s12369-020-00691-4,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090755646&doi=10.1007%2fs12369-020-00691-4&partnerID=40&md5=e6d2fbb614c296ba7d803a31715e7357,2020-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:35:18Z,2021-02-15T22:35:18Z,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 0</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,empathetic speech synthesis and testing for healthcare robots,empathetic speech synthesis and testing for healthcare robots
,,,,,,,,,,Socially-Assistive Robots Using Empathy to Reduce Pain and Distress during Peripheral IV Placement in Children,"Objectives. Socially-assistive robots (SAR) have been used to reduce pain and distress in children in medical settings. Patients who perceive empathic treatment have increased satisfaction and improved outcomes. We sought to determine if an empathic SAR could be developed and used to decrease pain and fear associated with peripheral IV placement in children. Methods. We conducted a pilot study of children receiving IV placement. Participating children were randomized to interact with (1) no robot, or a commercially available 3D printed humanoid SAR robot programmed with (2) empathy or (3) distraction conditions. Children and parents completed demographic surveys, and children used an adapted validated questionnaire to rate the robot's empathy on an 8-point Likert scale. Survey scores were compared by the t-test or chi-square test. Pain and fear were measured by self-report using the FACES and FEAR scales, and video tapes were coded using the CHEOPS and FLACC. Scores were compared using repeated measures 2-way ANOVA. This trial is registered with NCT02840942. Results. Thirty-one children with an average age of 9.6 years completed the study. For all measures, mean pain and fear scores were lowest in the empathy group immediately before and after IV placement. Children were more likely to attribute characteristics of empathy to the empathic condition (Likert score 7.24 v. 4.70; p=0.012) and to report that having the empathic vs. distraction robot made the IV hurt less (7.45 vs. 4.88; p=0.026). Conclusions. Children were able to identify SAR designed to display empathic characteristics and reported it helped with IV insertion pain and fear. Mean scores of self-reported or objective pain and fear scales were the lowest in the empathy group and the highest in the distraction condition before and after IV insertion. This result suggests empathy improves SAR functionality when used for painful medical procedures and informs future research into SAR for pain management. © 2020 Margaret J Trost et al.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2020,"Trost, M.J.; Chrysilla, G.; Gold, J.I.; Matarić, M.",Pain Research and Management,,,ZXM72SSP,10.1155/2020/7935215,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85083881603&doi=10.1155%2f2020%2f7935215&partnerID=40&md5=ea3dec2f225f6047f5a5282c0de25503,2020-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:35:18Z,2021-02-15T22:35:18Z,,,,,2020,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 2</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,socially-assistive robots using empathy to reduce pain and distress during peripheral iv placement in children,sociallyassistive robots using empathy to reduce pain and distress during peripheral iv placement in children
,,,,,,,,,,Emotion Synchronization Method for Robot Facial Expression,"Nowadays, communication robots are becoming popular since they are actively used in both commercially and personally. Increasing empathy between human-robot can effectively enhance the positive impression. Empathy can be created by syncing human emotion with the robot expression. Emotion estimation can be done by analyzing controllable expressions like facial expression, or uncontrollable expression like biological signals. In this work, we propose the comparison of robot expression synchronization with estimated emotion based on either facial expression or biological signal. In order to find out which of the proposed methods yield the best impression, subjective impression rating is used in the experiment. From the result of the impression evaluation, we found that the robot’s facial expression synchronization using the synchronization based on periodical emotion value performs the best and best suitable for emotion estimated both from facial expression and biological signal. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2020,"Kajihara, Y.; Sripian, P.; Feng, C.; Sugaya, M.",Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),,,BTYJ3QW7,10.1007/978-3-030-49062-1_44,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088746132&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-49062-1_44&partnerID=40&md5=6d35e19fe3d393e315a818e5b4539e20,2020-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:35:18Z,2021-02-15T22:35:18Z,,644-653,,,12182 LNCS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 0</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,emotion synchronization method for robot facial expression,emotion synchronization method for robot facial expression

Prosocial games are games focusing on helping others. Game researchers have been keen to investigate factors that influence the immersive experience in digital games. Previous studies show that VR allows people to take the perspective of others, inducing empathy and prosocial behaviour in the real world. In this lab-based study, we explore whether and how taking the perspective of other game characters–NPCs in a prosocial VR game–influences players’ in-game empathy towards NPCs and game immersion. Participants first experienced either a robot’s perspective of being destroyed by fire in VR or read a text description about the same event. Then, they participated a prosocial VR game in which they saved robots. The findings show that perspective-taking experiences indirectly enhance participants’ game immersion via the effects of closeness with the destroyed robot and empathy towards the four robots protected by the player. This indirect effect is moderated by players’ weekly exposure to video games. These results suggest that VR-based perspective-taking of NPCs can indirectly enhance gameplay experiences in prosocial VR games.

While human-human mimicry has been extensively studied, human-agent and human-robot mimicry have been addressed only recently, and the individual characteristics that affect them are still unknown. This paper explores whether the humanlikeness and embodiment of an agent affect human facial mimicry and which personality and empathy traits are related to facial mimicry of human and artificial agents. We exposed 46 participants to the six basic emotions displayed by a video-recorded human and three artificial agents (a physical robot, a video-recorded robot, and a virtual agent) differing in humanlikeness (humanlike, characterlike, and a morph between the two). We asked participants to recognize the facial expressions performed by each agent and measured their facial mimicry using automatic detection of facial action unit activation. Results showed that mimicry was affected by the agents’ embodiment, but not by their humanlikeness, and that it correlated both with individual traits denoting sociability and sympathy and with traits advantageous for emotion recognition. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2020,"Perugia, G.; Paetzel, M.; Castellano, G.",Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),,,5PHU38FM,10.1007/978-3-030-62056-1_11,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097197855&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-62056-1_11&partnerID=40&md5=95f5dab4e658c63f6012ff6fc072f43a,2020-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:35:18Z,2021-02-15T22:35:18Z,,120-131,,,12483 LNAI,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 0</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,"on the role of personality and empathy in human-human, human-agent, and human-robot mimicry",on the role of personality and empathy in humanhuman humanagent and humanrobot mimicry

We propose a simple model of grounded affect and kinesic expression before presenting the qualitative findings of an exploratory study (N = 9), during which participants were interviewed after watching expressive and non-expressive hexapod robots perform different ‘scenes’. A summary of these interviews is presented and a number of emerging themes are identified and discussed.

,,,,,,,,,,Improving Interactions with Healthcare Robots: A Review of Communication Behaviours in Social and Healthcare Contexts,"A growing shortfall exists between the number of older individuals who require healthcare support and the number of qualified healthcare professionals who can provide this. Robots offer the potential to provide healthcare support to patients both at home and in healthcare settings. However, in order for robots to be successfully implemented in these environments, they need to behave in ways that are appropriate and acceptable to human users. One way to identify appropriate social behaviours for healthcare robots is to model their behaviour on interactions between healthcare professionals and patients. This literature review aimed to inform healthcare robotics research by highlighting communication behaviours that are important within the context of healthcare. The review focussed on relevant research in human clinical interactions, followed by a review of similar factors in social robotics research. Three databases were searched for terms relating to healthcare professional communication behaviours associated with patient outcomes. The results identified key communication behaviours that can convey clinical empathy, including humour, self-disclosure, facial expressions, eye gaze, body posture, and gestures. A further search was conducted to identify research examining these key behaviours within the context of social and healthcare robotics. Research into these factors in human–robot interaction in healthcare is limited to date, and this review provides a useful guide for future research. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2020,"Johanson, D.L.; Ahn, H.S.; Broadbent, E.",International Journal of Social Robotics,,,7T52K2WI,10.1007/s12369-020-00719-9,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85095992051&doi=10.1007%2fs12369-020-00719-9&partnerID=40&md5=f3f195ead2052764e3a972a247dbf24f,2020-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:35:19Z,2021-02-15T22:35:19Z,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 0</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,improving interactions with healthcare robots: a review of communication behaviours in social and healthcare contexts,improving interactions with healthcare robots a review of communication behaviours in social and healthcare contexts

For the emotional gesture attributes, the level values were categorized as 'pleasure at low arousal', 'pleasure at high arousal', 'displeasure at low arousal', and 'displeasure at high arousal'. Among the communicative expression gesture attributes, the level values were categorized as ‘idling, conversation induction and concentration, and empathy’. Lastly, the derived attributes and the level values for the ‘emotional gesture’ and ‘communicative gesture’ have been integrated with the ones for the ‘functional/semantic gesture' derived on the previous studies; they have been presented as the robot's gesture interface design factors available in the aspect of the user experience. © 2020, Success Culture Press.

,,,,,,,,,,Care Robots: From Tools of Care to Training Opportunities. Moral Considerations,"New technology should not perceived as a threat: on the contrary, it is a resource. It is our job to use it in the most appropriate way. Moreover, new technology can make a significant contribution to nurse training: for example, immersion into virtual reality with a visor and a simple application does not only allow one to experience fantastic adventures, but also to enjoy a relationship with the patient through simulation. Also, virtual reality can promote patient/teacher interaction: both, for example, can be projected or immersed in virtual reality, or the teacher can project his ‘virtual’ image into a real scenario. However, robots too could contribute to training nursing staff: health operator training courses today widely use dummies which are appropriately planned for standing training. They are increasingly true-to-life, favouring empathy with the clinical situation simulated each time and allowing the student to exercise not only technical abilities, but also critical thinking, the ability to work in a team and communication skills. We shall examine some moral questions linked to the increasingly frequent use of human-faceted robots to train nursing staff. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2020,"Balistreri, M.; Casile, F.",Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,,,JA9ZZ6WG,10.1007/978-3-030-23884-1_3,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85068643881&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-23884-1_3&partnerID=40&md5=ddeacd68dcfb7fbd19f08f5b10213563,2020-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:35:19Z,2021-02-15T22:35:19Z,,18-25,,,1008,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 2</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,care robots: from tools of care to training opportunities. moral considerations,care robots from tools of care to training opportunities moral considerations
,,,,,,,,,,The hard problem of AI rights,"In the past few years, the subject of AI rights—the thesis that AIs, robots, and other artefacts (hereafter, simply ‘AIs’) ought to be included in the sphere of moral concern—has started to receive serious attention from scholars. In this paper, I argue that the AI rights research program is beset by an epistemic problem that threatens to impede its progress—namely, a lack of a solution to the ‘Hard Problem’ of consciousness: the problem of explaining why certain brain states give rise to experience. To motivate this claim, I consider three ways in which to ground AI rights—namely: superintelligence, empathy, and a capacity for consciousness. I argue that appeals to superintelligence and empathy are problematic, and that consciousness should be our central focus, as in the case of animal rights. However, I also argue that AI rights is disanalogous from animal rights in an important respect: animal rights can proceed without a solution to the ‘Hard Problem’ of consciousness. Not so with AI rights, I argue. There we cannot make the same kinds of assumptions that we do about animal consciousness, since we still do not understand why brain states give rise to conscious mental states in humans. © 2020, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2020,"Andreotta, A.J.",AI and Society,,,JATUII48,10.1007/s00146-020-00997-x,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085877284&doi=10.1007%2fs00146-020-00997-x&partnerID=40&md5=bd9018524171b9ac98aa2157ae1ac084,2020-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:35:19Z,2021-02-15T22:35:19Z,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 0</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,the hard problem of ai rights,the hard problem of ai rights
,,,,,,,,,,Love(rs) in the making: Moral subjectivity in the face of sexbots,"This article offers a novel reading of the criticisms of sex robots put forward by the Campaign Against Sex Robots (CASR). Focusing on the implication of a loss of empathy, it structures CASR's worries as an argument from moral degradation centered around the potential effects on sexbot users' sexual and moral subjectivity. This argument is subsequently explored through the combined lenses of postphenomenology and the ethical phenomenology of Emmanuel Levinas. In so doing, it describes the type of human-technology relations that sexbots invite, identifying alterity as a central feature. It also highlights how alterity, responsibility, and subjectivity are intimately connected. However, that connection is distinctly different in sexual circumstances, making current versions of Levinasian roboethics largely inapplicable for the ethics of sexbots. To overcome this, the article delves into Levinas' phenomenology of Eros and identifies voluptuousness as a type of enjoyment of the Other that is different from the enjoyment invited by current sexbots and is compatible with responsibility. Based on this, the article provides examples of how this phenomenology of Eros can inspire the design of future sexbots in ways that alleviate some of CASR's concerns. © 2020 Jan Peter Bergen, published by De Gruyter 2020.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2020,"Bergen, J.P.",Paladyn,,,EERPITEC,10.1515/pjbr-2020-0016,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088011901&doi=10.1515%2fpjbr-2020-0016&partnerID=40&md5=a1955bd5c3aa900399f2f1c1ffd6180d,2020-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:35:19Z,2021-02-15T22:35:19Z,,284-300,,1,11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 0</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,love(rs) in the making: moral subjectivity in the face of sexbots,lovers in the making moral subjectivity in the face of sexbots
,,,,,,,,,,Can a robot be a moral agent?,"Issues of the ethically aligned design of intelligent/autonomous systems have now moved into the fields of normative and technical regulation. If a system must make ethically determined decisions, then it must be recognized as a moral agent. This paper provides a list of the properties of a moral agent and shows not only that an artificial agent can have such properties, but also that they are technically determined as manifestations of adaptive mechanisms. In particular, it is shown that mechanisms such as the presence of the “I” component in the sign-oriented picture of the agent’s world, the presence of an emotional-needs architecture, and the mechanism for comparing the observed conspecific with the “I” make it possible to realize the phenomena of social learning and a property such as empathy. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2020,"Karpov, V.E.",Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),,,5A5H4IXW,10.1007/978-3-030-59535-7_5,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85092173472&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-59535-7_5&partnerID=40&md5=d8316768b923311d1b05807222c77b02,2020-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:35:19Z,2021-02-15T22:35:19Z,,61-70,,,12412 LNAI,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 0</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,can a robot be a moral agent?,can a robot be a moral agent
,,,,,,,,,,Perceived Mistreatment and Emotional Capability Following Aggressive Treatment of Robots and Computers,"Robots (and computers) are increasingly being used in scenarios where they interact socially with people. How people react to these agents is telling about the perceived empathy of such agents. Mistreatment of robots (or computers) by co-workers might provoke such telling reactions. This study examines perceived mistreatment directed towards a robot in comparison to a computer. This will provide some understanding of how people feel about robots in collaborative social settings. We conducted a two by two between-subjects study with 80 participants. Participants worked cooperatively with either a robot or a computer agent. An experiment confederate would either act aggressively or neutrally towards the agent. We hypothesized that people would not perceive aggressive speech as mistreatment when an agent was capable of emotional feelings and similar to themselves; that participants would perceive the robot as more similar in appearance and emotionally capable to themselves than a computer; and so would observe more mistreatment with a robot. The final results supported our hypotheses; the participants observed greater mistreatment for the robot, but not the computer. Also participants felt significantly more sympathetic towards the robot and believed that it was much more emotionally capable. © 2019, The Author(s).",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2019,"Carlson, Z.; Lemmon, L.; Higgins, M.C.; Frank, D.; Salek Shahrezaie, R.; Feil-Seifer, D.",International Journal of Social Robotics,,,QZ4FPF5F,10.1007/s12369-019-00599-8,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85074582945&doi=10.1007%2fs12369-019-00599-8&partnerID=40&md5=cda66cf87d85769abf9cea41a774b3cf,2019-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:35:19Z,2021-02-15T22:35:19Z,,727-739,,5,11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 4</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,perceived mistreatment and emotional capability following aggressive treatment of robots and computers,perceived mistreatment and emotional capability following aggressive treatment of robots and computers
,,,,,,,,,,Embodiment into a robot increases its acceptability,"Recent studies have shown how embodiment induced by multisensory bodily interactions between individuals can positively change social attitudes (closeness, empathy, racial biases). Here we use a simple neuroscience-inspired procedure to beam our human subjects into one of two distinct robots and demonstrate how this can readily increase acceptability and social closeness to that robot. Participants wore a Head Mounted Display tracking their head movements and displaying the 3D visual scene taken from the eyes of a robot which was positioned in front of a mirror and piloted by the subjects’ head movements. As a result, participants saw themselves as a robot. When participant’ and robot’s head movements were correlated, participants felt that they were incorporated into the robot with a sense of agency. Critically, the robot they embodied was judged more likeable and socially closer. Remarkably, we found that the beaming experience with correlated head movements and corresponding sensation of embodiment and social proximity, was independent of robots’ humanoid’s appearance. These findings not only reveal the ease of body-swapping, via visual-motor synchrony, into robots that do not share any clear human resemblance, but they may also pave a new way to make our future robotic helpers socially acceptable. © 2019, The Author(s).",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2019,"Ventre-Dominey, J.; Gibert, G.; Bosse-Platiere, M.; Farnè, A.; Dominey, P.F.; Pavani, F.",Scientific Reports,,,GDDKQ8W7,10.1038/s41598-019-46528-7,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85069005120&doi=10.1038%2fs41598-019-46528-7&partnerID=40&md5=c7b84e03aa3b4bd20eb345fc595e7e4e,2019-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:35:19Z,2021-02-15T22:35:19Z,,,,1,9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 5</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,embodiment into a robot increases its acceptability,embodiment into a robot increases its acceptability
,,,,,,,,,,The effect of robot attentional behaviors on user perceptions and behaviors in a simulated health care interaction: Randomized controlled trial,"Background: For robots to be effectively used in health applications, they need to display appropriate social behaviors. A fundamental requirement in all social interactions is the ability to engage, maintain, and demonstrate attention. Attentional behaviors include leaning forward, self-disclosure, and changes in voice pitch. Objective: This study aimed to examine the effect of robot attentional behaviors on user perceptions and behaviors in a simulated health care interaction. Methods: A parallel randomized controlled trial with a 1:1:1 allocation ration was conducted. We randomized participants to 1 of 4 experimental conditions before engaging in a scripted face-to-face interaction with a fully automated medical receptionist robot. Experimental conditions included a self-disclosure condition, voice pitch change condition, forward lean condition, and neutral condition. Participants completed paper-based postinteraction measures relating to engagement, perceived robot attention, and perceived robot empathy. We video recorded interactions and coded for participant attentional behaviors. Results: A total of 181 participants were recruited from the University of Auckland. Participants who interacted with the robot in the forward lean and self-disclosure conditions found the robot to be significantly more stimulating than those who interacted with the robot in the voice pitch or neutral conditions (P=.03). Participants in the forward lean, self-disclosure, and neutral conditions found the robot to be significantly more interesting than those in the voice pitch condition (P<.001). Participants in the forward lean and self-disclosure conditions spent significantly more time looking at the robot than participants in the neutral condition (P<.001). Significantly, more participants in the self-disclosure condition laughed during the interaction (P=.01), whereas significantly more participants in the forward lean condition leant toward the robot during the interaction (P<.001). Conclusions: The use of self-disclosure and forward lean by a health care robot can increase human engagement and attentional behaviors. Voice pitch changes did not increase attention or engagement. The small effects with regard to participant perceptions are potentially because of the limitations in self-report measures or a lack of comparison for most participants who had never interacted with a robot before. Further research could explore the use of self-disclosure and forward lean using a within-subjects design and in real health care settings. © Deborah L Johanson, Ho Seok Ahn, Bruce A MacDonald, Byeong Kyu Ahn, JongYoon Lim, Euijun Hwang, Craig J Sutherland, Elizabeth Broadbent.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2019,"Johanson, D.L.; Ahn, H.S.; MacDonald, B.A.; Ahn, B.K.; Lim, J.; Hwang, E.; Sutherland, C.J.; Broadbent, E.",Journal of Medical Internet Research,,,CDCLWG9X,10.2196/13667,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85072908937&doi=10.2196%2f13667&partnerID=40&md5=244df67bd1698544f060020541459c91,2019-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:35:20Z,2021-02-15T22:35:20Z,,,,10,21,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 4</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,the effect of robot attentional behaviors on user perceptions and behaviors in a simulated health care interaction: randomized controlled trial,the effect of robot attentional behaviors on user perceptions and behaviors in a simulated health care interaction randomized controlled trial

,,,,,,,,,,A neurocognitive investigation of the impact of socializing with a robot on empathy for pain,"To what extent can humans form social relationships with robots? In the present study, we combined functional neuroimaging with a robot socializing intervention to probe the flexibility of empathy, a core component of social relationships, towards robots. Twenty-six individuals underwent identical fMRI sessions before and after being issued a social robot to take home and interact with over the course of a week. While undergoing fMRI, participants observed videos of a human actor or a robot experiencing pain or pleasure in response to electrical stimulation. Repetition suppression of activity in the pain network, a collection of brain regions associated with empathy and emotional responding, was measured to test whether socializing with a social robot leads to greater overlap in neural mechanisms when observing human and robotic agents experiencing pain or pleasure. In contrast to our hypothesis, functional region-of-interest analyses revealed no change in neural overlap for agents after the socializing intervention. Similarly, no increase in activation when observing a robot experiencing pain emerged post-socializing. Whole-brain analysis showed that, before the socializing intervention, superior parietal and early visual regions are sensitive to novel agents, while after socializing, medial temporal regions show agent sensitivity. A region of the inferior parietal lobule was sensitive to novel emotions, but only during the pre-socializing scan session. Together, these findings suggest that a short socialization intervention with a social robot does not lead to discernible differences in empathy towards the robot, as measured by behavioural or brain responses. We discuss the extent to which long-term socialization with robots might shape social cognitive processes and ultimately our relationships with these machines.

,,,,,,,,,,"Degrees of Empathy: Humans’ Empathy Toward Humans, Animals, Robots and Objects","The aim of this paper is to present an experiment in which we compare the degree of empathy that a convenience sample of students expressed with humans, animals, robots and objects. The present study broadens the spectrum of the elements eliciting empathy that previous research has so far explored separately. Our research questions are: does the continuum represented by this set of elements elicit empathy? Is it possible to observe a linear decrease of empathy according to different features of the selected elements? More broadly, does empathy, as a construct, resist in front of the diversification of the element eliciting it? Results show that participants expressed empathy differently when exposed to three clusters of social actors being mistreated: they felt more sad, sorry, aroused and out of control for animals than for humans, but showed little to no empathy for objects. Interestingly, robots that looked more human-like evoked emotions similar to those evoked by humans, while robots that looked more animal-like evoked emotions half-way between those evoked by humans and objects.

,,,,,,,,,,"“Danger, Will Robinson!” The challenges of social robots for intergroup relations","Society's increasing reliance on robots in everyday life provides exciting opportunities for social psychologists to work with engineers in the nascent field of social robotics. In contrast to industrial robots that, for example, may be used on an assembly line, social robots are designed specifically to interact with humans and/or other robots. People tend to perceive social robots as autonomous and capable of having a mind. As such, they are also more likely to be subject to social categorization by humans. As social robots become more human like, people may also feel greater empathy for them and treat robots more like (human) ingroup members. On the other hand, as they become more human like, robots also challenge our human distinctiveness, threaten our identity, and elicit suspicion about their ability to deceive us with their human-like qualities. We review relevant research to explore this apparent paradox, particularly from an intergroup relations perspective. We discuss these findings and propose three research questions that we believe social psychologists are ideally suited to address. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2019,"Vanman, E.J.; Kappas, A.",Social and Personality Psychology Compass,,,HJ6B2BSV,10.1111/spc3.12489,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85070056360&doi=10.1111%2fspc3.12489&partnerID=40&md5=df6ade6d0336dd74942733c534399eb2,2019-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:35:21Z,2021-02-15T22:35:21Z,,,,8,13,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 4</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,"“danger, will robinson!” the challenges of social robots for intergroup relations",danger will robinson the challenges of social robots for intergroup relations
,,,,,,,,,,Expressing the Personality of a Humanoid Robot as a Talking Partner in an Elementary School Classroom,"A humanoid robot NAO was introduced as a talking partner of teaching AI and robot to the elementary school students to stimulate empathy for the intelligent machines. Two dialog types were defined. First, the query type dialog was defined as a robot’s answer to human questioning. Second, the phatic type dialogs were defined to express the personality of the robot. While the former type dialog is initiated by formulated questioning, the latter type response can even be induced by misrecognition of human speech. Applying this simple method, the same unit sessions for each of the three classrooms on AI and robot were conducted. During the sessions, students’ burst of laughter was induced at 83% of the phatic type dialog, and the laughing response was found at 44% of the query type dialogs. By this representation, it became easier for the students to empathize with the robot. After this session, a questionnaire survey on the preference of robot pet, on what the students wanted to talk with the robot that dreams at night, and on their view of life if AI robots replaced human workers was conducted. The results suggested that the students got to imagine a virtual subjectivity of the intelligent machines and considered a better life for the human with them. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2019,"Omokawa, R.; Kobayashi, M.; Matsuura, S.",Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),,,PDXJJSNK,10.1007/978-3-030-23560-4_36,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85069875511&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-23560-4_36&partnerID=40&md5=6fcb8f37cfa76597c0643f0aa6619d9d,2019-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:35:21Z,2021-02-15T22:35:21Z,,494-506,,,11572 LNCS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 0</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,expressing the personality of a humanoid robot as a talking partner in an elementary school classroom,expressing the personality of a humanoid robot as a talking partner in an elementary school classroom
,,,,,,,,,,User Experience Study: The Service Expectation of Hotel Guests to the Utilization of AI-Based Service Robot in Full-Service Hotels,"With the dramatic development of AI technology, the concept of robotic hotel is entering the public’s awareness. Although AI application brings in high efficiency, low labor cost and novelty, practical operation of robotic hotels still faces with challenges. This quantitative research aims at understanding the current user expectation level of AI robotic hotel and robot appliance. Based on that, it tries to make the user classification by demographic, behavioral and attitude factors. By using the refined SERVQUAL model, it gathers the expectation from five dimensions involving tangibles, reliability, responsiveness, assurance and empathy. These research objectives were realized by using survey-designed questionnaires and distributed by a snowball sampling method conducted in Beijing. After validity and reliability test, data collected from the field were analyzed by a variety of inspections. It is found that education, attitude and income level have a significant effect on the expectation to stay in the robotic hotel, which provided the basis of market position for robotic hotel operators. Through regression analysis, the model was established to identify what factors played an important part and how they worked. It is found that tangibles and responsiveness expectation significantly and positively contributed to increases in general user expectation to robotic hotels. This thesis drew up several conclusions, which would help industry players including hoteliers, AI robot suppliers better understand details of the user group in their decision-making process, as well as academic side to formulate a tailored model to evaluate the interaction between AI robots and hotel guests. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2019,"Zhang, Y.; Qi, S.",Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),,,JPS4J34L,10.1007/978-3-030-22335-9_24,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85069831658&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-22335-9_24&partnerID=40&md5=3e80fc2d1eb7b32d188423262f9c2825,2019-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:35:21Z,2021-02-15T22:35:21Z,,350-366,,,11588 LNCS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 1</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,user experience study: the service expectation of hotel guests to the utilization of ai-based service robot in full-service hotels,user experience study the service expectation of hotel guests to the utilization of aibased service robot in fullservice hotels
,,,,,,,,,,Endowing a robotic tutor with empathic qualities: Design and pilot evaluation,"As increasingly more research efforts are geared towards creating robots that can teach and interact with children in educational contexts, it has been speculated that endowing robots with artificial empathy may facilitate learning. In this paper, we provide a background to the concept of empathy, and how it factors into learning. We then present our approach to equipping a robotic tutor with several empathic qualities, describing the technical architecture and its components, a map-reading learning scenario developed for an interactive multitouch table, as well as the pedagogical and empathic strategies devised for the robot. We also describe the results of a pilot study comparing the robotic tutor with these empathic qualities against a version of the tutor without them. The pilot study was performed with 26 school children aged 10-11 at their school.

,,,,,,,,,,Avatars in Pain: Visible Harm Enhances Mind Perception in Humans and Robots,"Previous research has shown that when people read vignettes about the infliction of harm upon an entity appearing to have no more than a liminal mind, their attributions of mind to that entity increased. Currently, we investigated if the presence of a facial wound enhanced the perception of mental capacities (experience and agency) in response to images of robotic and human-like avatars, compared with unharmed avatars. The results revealed that harmed versions of both robotic and human-like avatars were imbued with mind to a higher degree, irrespective of the baseline level of mind attributed to their unharmed counterparts. Perceptions of capacity for pain mediated attributions of experience, while both pain and empathy mediated attributions of abilities linked to agency. The findings suggest that harm, even when it appears to have been inflicted unintentionally, may augment mind perception for robotic as well as for nearly human entities, at least as long as it is perceived to elicit pain. © The Author(s) 2018.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2018,"Swiderska, A.; Küster, D.",Perception,,,84PRAKQ9,10.1177/0301006618809919,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85058656094&doi=10.1177%2f0301006618809919&partnerID=40&md5=2d29a1feddf28df7efb1c2f080d656ba,2018-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:35:21Z,2021-02-15T22:35:21Z,,1139-1152,,12,47,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 5</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,avatars in pain: visible harm enhances mind perception in humans and robots,avatars in pain visible harm enhances mind perception in humans and robots
,,,,,,,,,,Emotional empathy as a mechanism of synchronisation in child-robot interaction,"Simulating emotional experience, emotional empathy is the fundamental ingredient of interpersonal communication. In the speaker-listener scenario, the speaker is always a child, the listener is a human or a toy robot. Two groups of neurotypical children aged 6 years on average composed the population: one Japanese (n = 20) and one French (n = 20). Revealing potential similarities in communicative exchanges in both groups when in contact with a human or a toy robot, the results might signify that emotional empathy requires the implication of an automatic identification. In this sense, emotional empathy might be considered a broad idiosyncrasy, a kind of synchronisation, offering the mind a peculiar form of communication. Our findings seem to be consistent with the assumption that children's brains would be constructed to simulate the feelings of others in order to ensure interpersonal synchronisation. © 2018 Giannopulu, Terada and Watanabe.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2018,"Giannopulu, I.; Terada, K.; Watanabe, T.",Frontiers in Psychology,,,FSWK2JR8,10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01852,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055052507&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2018.01852&partnerID=40&md5=4e3455fc4099810d57dbf0e2e66d93bf,2018-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:35:22Z,2021-02-15T22:35:22Z,,,,OCT,9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 5</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,emotional empathy as a mechanism of synchronisation in child-robot interaction,emotional empathy as a mechanism of synchronisation in childrobot interaction
,,,,,,,,,,Socially grounded game strategy enhances bonding and perceived smartness of a humanoid robot,"In search for better technological solutions for education, we adapted a principle from economic game theory, namely that giving a help will promote collaboration and eventually long-term relations between a robot and a child. This principle has been shown to be effective in games between humans and between humans and computer agents. We compared the social and cognitive engagement of children when playing checkers game combined with a social strategy against a robot or against a computer. We found that by combining the social and game strategy the children (average age of 8.3 years) had more empathy and social engagement with the robot since the children did not want to necessarily win against it. This finding is promising for using social strategies for the creation of long-term relations between robots and children and making educational tasks more engaging. An additional outcome of the study was the significant difference in the perception of the children about the difficulty of the game–the game with the robot was seen as more challenging and the robot–as a smarter opponent. This finding might be due to the higher perceived or expected intelligence from the robot, or because of the higher complexity of seeing patterns in three-dimensional world. © 2017 The Author(s).

,,,,,,,,,,Fake empathy and human- robot interaction (HRI): A preliminary study,"Empathy is a basic emotion trigger for human beings, especially while regulating social relationships and behaviour. The main challenge of this paper is study whether people's empathic reactions towards robots change depending on previous information given to human about the robot before the interaction. The use of false data about robot skills creates different levels of what we call 'fake empathy'. This study performs an experiment in WOZ environment in which different subjects (n=17) interacting with the same robot while they believe that the robot is a different robot, up to three versions. Each robot scenario provides a different 'humanoid' description, and out hypothesis is that the more human-like looks the robot, the more empathically can be the human responses. Results were obtained from questionnaires and multi- angle video recordings. Positive results reinforce the strength of our hypothesis, although we recommend a new and bigger and then more robust experiment. © Copyright 2018, IGI Global.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2018,"Vallverdú, J.; Nishida, T.; Ohmoto, Y.; Moran, S.; Lázare, S.",International Journal of Technology and Human Interaction,,,7S9DVZEW,10.4018/IJTHI.2018010103,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85033380873&doi=10.4018%2fIJTHI.2018010103&partnerID=40&md5=e8c1b39365a7dd4fb4e56730f51ebee7,2018-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:35:23Z,2021-02-15T22:35:23Z,,44-59,,1,14,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 3</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,fake empathy and human- robot interaction (hri): a preliminary study,fake empathy and human robot interaction hri a preliminary study
,,,,,,,,,,Evolving robot empathy towards humans with motor disabilities through artificial pain generation,"In contact assistive robots, a prolonged physical engagement between robots and humans with motor disabilities due to shoulder injuries, for instance, may at times lead humans to experience pain. In this situation, robots will require sophisticated capabilities, such as the ability to recognize human pain in advance and generate counter-responses as follow up emphatic action. Hence, it is important for robots to acquire an appropriate pain concept that allows them to develop these capabilities. This paper conceptualizes empathy generation through the realization of synthetic pain classes integrated into a robot's self-awareness framework, and the implementation of fault detection on the robot body serves as a primary source of pain activation. Projection of human shoulder motion into the robot arm motion acts as a fusion process, which is used as a medium to gather information for analyses then to generate corresponding synthetic pain and emphatic responses. An experiment is designed to mirror a human peer's shoulder motion into an observer robot. The results demonstrate that the fusion takes place accurately whenever unified internal states are achieved, allowing accurate classification of synthetic pain categories and generation of empathy responses in a timely fashion. Future works will consider a pain activation mechanism development. © 2018 the Author(s).",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2018,"Anshar, M.; Williams, M.-A.",AIMS Neuroscience,,,69QJFWR2,10.3934/NEUROSCIENCE.2018.1.56,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85046542640&doi=10.3934%2fNEUROSCIENCE.2018.1.56&partnerID=40&md5=94774a1cfd673260d0b54325f0e577c0,2018-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:35:23Z,2021-02-15T22:35:23Z,,56-73,,1,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 2</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,evolving robot empathy towards humans with motor disabilities through artificial pain generation,evolving robot empathy towards humans with motor disabilities through artificial pain generation

On the other hand, however, more complex technology and/or services inhibit users' satisfaction and,consequently,the intention to adopt SST, because such SST can instill fear in users. Nevertheless, at present, patients and other people who are interested in their own health and well-being are paying great attention to healthcare robots (as a form of SST)and,consequently, it has become crucial to investigate how these healthcare robots can positively influence users' satisfaction with them. Hence, this study aims to empirically investigate the factors that affect users' satisfaction with healthcare robots, especially in regard to human-robot interaction (HRI). Methods/Statistical analysis: We focused on the theory of heterophily and applied a series of factors identified in previous robot-adoption studies.Uniquely, this study focuses on users' heterophily with healthcare robots, examining heterophily through three fundamental ele-ments, empathy, professionalism, and personality, which we considered to be suitable fordetermining user satisfaction with HRI-based communication.To prove the validity of our hypotheses, we conducted an empirical testthat involved participants receiving a short health assessment from a robot. Findings: The findings of our empirical test supported our hypothesis that the lower the difference in empathy between a user and robot, the higher the level of user satisfaction with the humanoid-style healthcare service. Further, our results also suggest that heterogeneity between a user and healthcare robot is positively associated with user satisfaction. Improvements/Applications: First, to increase user satisfaction,robots must be provided with the ability to somehow recognizea user's personality and adjust their own accordingly before beginning the robot-based healthcare service. Secondly, users' behavior patterns should be analyzed by the healthcare robot. Overall, our study empirically shows the importance of ensuring thatprofessionalism is present in healthcare-domain-related HRI. © 2018 Ohbyung Kwon at.al.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2018,"Kwon, O.; Kim, J.; Jin, Y.; Lee, N.",International Journal of Engineering and Technology(UAE),,,XVNIE98V,10.14419/ijet.v7i2.12.11038,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85045016067&doi=10.14419%2fijet.v7i2.12.11038&partnerID=40&md5=5c2596fb95a967cfa7ed39ad90f59911,2018-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:35:23Z,2021-02-15T22:35:23Z,,68-75,,2,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 0</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,impact of human-robot interaction on user satisfaction with humanoid-based healthcare,impact of humanrobot interaction on user satisfaction with humanoidbased healthcare

Un-fortunately, many people cannot live with animals because of allergies, infection risk, or risk of damage to rental housing. To address these problems, some research groups have investigated robot-based psychotherapy. However, the important healing elements for therapy robots were not identified. Therefore, we conducted an Internet survey to determine the design elements of such a robot that might engender a healing mood and the functions that should be implemented. We assumed that a healing mood could be induced based on the interactive functions and appearance. To verify this hypothesis, we developed and evaluated a new interactive therapy robot. Next, we conducted interviews with individuals who interacted with a prototype therapy robot. The interviews revealed that the appearance of the robot was critical to engendering feelings of healing, comfort, and empathy. In addition, the size, softness, and comfort of the interactive therapy robot contributed to people feeling affection towards it. We also confirmed the importance of the robot appearing to listen to those who interacted with it.

It is argued that emotions serve a critical function in intelligent behavior and some researchers posed the questions of whether a robot could be intelligent without emotions. As a result, emotion recognition and adequate reaction are essential requirements for enhancing the quality of human robot interaction. This study proposes a computational model of emotion capable of clustering the perceived facial expression, and using cognitive reappraisal to switch its internal state so as to give a human-like reaction over the time. That is, the agent learns the person’s facial expression by using Self Organizing Map, and gives it a meaning by mapping the perceived expression into its internal state diagram.

,,,,,,,,,,Towards empathetic human-robot interactions,"Since the late 1990s when speech companies began providing their customer-service software in the market, people have gotten used to speaking to machines. As people interact more often with voice and gesture controlled machines, they expect the machines to recognize different emotions, and understand other high level communication features such as humor, sarcasm and intention. In order to make such communication possible, the machines need an empathy module in them, which is a software system that can extract emotions from human speech and behavior and can decide the correct response of the robot. Although research on empathetic robots is still in the primary stage, current methods involve using signal processing techniques, sentiment analysis and machine learning algorithms to make robots that can ‘understand’ human emotion. Other aspects of human-robot interaction include facial expression and gesture recognition, as well as robot movement to convey emotion and intent. We propose Zara the Supergirl as a prototype system of empathetic robots. It is a software-based virtual android, with an animated cartoon character to present itself on the screen. She will get ‘smarter’ and more empathetic, by having machine learning algorithms, and gathering more data and learning from it. In this paper, we present our work so far in the areas of deep learning of emotion and sentiment recognition, as well as humor recognition.

If a robot can identify emotions and intentions of a human interacting with it, interactions with humans can potentially become more natural and effective. However, mechanisms of perception and empathy used by humans to achieve this understanding may not be suitable or adequate for use within robots. Electroencephalography (EEG) can be used for recording signals revealing emotions and motivations from a human brain. This study aimed to evaluate different machine learning techniques to classify EEG data associated with specific affective/emotional states. For experimental purposes, we used visual (IAPS) and physical (Tower of Hanoi) tasks to record human emotional states in the form of EEG data. The obtained EEG data processed, formatted and evaluated using various machine learning techniques to find out which method can most accurately classify EEG data according to associated affective/emotional states. The experiment confirms the choice of a method for improving the accuracy of results. According to the results, Support Vector Machine was the first, and Regression Tree was the second best method for classifying EEG data associated with specific affective/emotional states with accuracies up to 70.00% and 60.00%, respectively.

,,,,,,,,,,Depersonalisation of killing: Towards a 21st century use of force “beyond good and evil?” [Depersonalizacija ubijanja ka upotrebi sile u 21. Veku „s onu stranu dobra i zla?“],"The article analyses how robotisation as the latest advance in military technology can depersonalise the methods of killing in the 21st century by turning enemy soldiers and civilians into mere objects devoid of moral value. The departing assumption is that robotisation of warfare transforms military operations into automated industrial processes with the aim of removing empathy as a redundant ‘cost’. The development of autonomous weapons systems raises a number of sharp ethical controversies related to the projected moral insensitivity of robots regarding the treatment of enemies and civilian population. The futurist vision of war as a foreign policy instrument entirely ‘purified’ of the risk of morally wrong actions is in opposition with the negative effects of the use of drones. The author concludes that the use of lethal robots in combat would eventually remove enemy soldiers and civilians from the realm of ethical reasoning and deprive them of human dignity. Decision to kill in military operations ought to be based on human conscience as the only proper framework of making decisions by reasoning whether an action is right or wrong. © 2018, University of Belgrade - Institute for Philosophy and Social Theory.

,,,,,,,,,,Three research directions for affective learning technologies,"Looking to the future of advanced learning technology research, understanding, supporting and explicitly designing for the role of affect is of great importance. I highlight three emerging areas of research with current research exemplars. First, simulating affect is necessary to enhance human-like relationships with technology; for example, with artificially intelligent virtual agents, or teachable robots as learning companions. Second, sensing and responding to learner affect in immersive learning experiences as well as learning at scale is rapidly evolving; for example, through affective intelligent tutoring systems, or dashboards driven by multimodal analytics. Third, designing technology-based learning experiences that promote, elicit and support affective outcomes requires theory building within the learning sciences; for example, to realize outcomes such as empathy or curiosity and formulate linkages to learning. Finally, I suggest how research in these areas of affective technology afford new opportunities to prepare learners for future learning and work environments. © ISLS.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2018,"Baylor, A.L.","Proceedings of International Conference of the Learning Sciences, ICLS",,,89BFKERS,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85053852093&partnerID=40&md5=f752722081155797b31c18bfb8421fc9,2018-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:35:24Z,2021-02-15T22:35:24Z,,1843-1846,,2018-June,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 0</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,three research directions for affective learning technologies,three research directions for affective learning technologies
,,,,,,,,,,Nudging for good: robots and the ethical appropriateness of nurturing empathy and charitable behavior,"An under-examined aspect of human–robot interaction that warrants further exploration is whether robots should be permitted to influence a user’s behavior for that person’s own good. Yet an even more controversial practice could be on the horizon, which is allowing a robot to “nudge” a user’s behavior for the good of society. In this article, we examine the feasibility of creating companion robots that would seek to nurture a user’s empathy toward other human beings. As more and more computing devices subtly and overtly influence human behavior, it is important to draw attention to whether it would be ethically appropriate for roboticists to pursue this type of design pathway. Our primary focus is on whether a companion robot could encourage humans to perform charitable acts; this design possibility illustrates the range of socially just actions that a robot could potentially elicit from a user and what the associated ethical concerns may be. © 2016, Springer-Verlag London.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2017,"Borenstein, J.; Arkin, R.C.",AI and Society,,,EZPFKTCQ,10.1007/s00146-016-0684-1,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85000443585&doi=10.1007%2fs00146-016-0684-1&partnerID=40&md5=aeb23d28928c11d0e8a8c5616b33c63b,2017-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:35:24Z,2021-02-15T22:35:24Z,,499-507,,4,32,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 11</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,nudging for good: robots and the ethical appropriateness of nurturing empathy and charitable behavior,nudging for good robots and the ethical appropriateness of nurturing empathy and charitable behavior
,,,,,,,,,,"You look human, but act like a machine: Agent appearance and behavior modulate different aspects of human-robot interaction","Gaze following occurs automatically in social interactions, but the degree to which gaze is followed depends on whether an agent is perceived to have a mind, making its behavior socially more relevant for the interaction. Mind perception also modulates the attitudes we have toward others, and determines the degree of empathy, prosociality, and morality invested in social interactions. Seeing mind in others is not exclusive to human agents, but mind can also be ascribed to non-human agents like robots, as long as their appearance and/or behavior allows them to be perceived as intentional beings. Previous studies have shown that human appearance and reliable behavior induce mind perception to robot agents, and positively affect attitudes and performance in human-robot interaction. What has not been investigated so far is whether different triggers of mind perception have an independent or interactive effect on attitudes and performance in human-robot interaction. We examine this question by manipulating agent appearance (human vs. robot) and behavior (reliable vs. random) within the same paradigm and examine how congruent (human/reliable vs. robot/random) versus incongruent (human/random vs. robot/reliable) combinations of these triggers affect performance (i.e., gaze following) and attitudes (i.e., agent ratings) in human-robot interaction. The results show that both appearance and behavior affect human-robot interaction but that the two triggers seem to operate in isolation, with appearance more strongly impacting attitudes, and behavior more strongly affecting performance. The implications of these findings for human-robot interaction are discussed. © 2017 Abubshait and Wiese.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2017,"Abubshait, A.; Wiese, E.",Frontiers in Psychology,,,45SJLQPX,10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01393,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85028087757&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.01393&partnerID=40&md5=7c76b89b0bf2a723ace310a3123236ab,2017-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:35:24Z,2021-02-15T22:35:24Z,,,,AUG,8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 31</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,"you look human, but act like a machine: agent appearance and behavior modulate different aspects of human-robot interaction",you look human but act like a machine agent appearance and behavior modulate different aspects of humanrobot interaction
,,,,,,,,,,Affective and engagement issues in the conception and assessment of a robot-assisted psychomotor therapy for persons with dementia,"The interest in robot-assisted therapies (RAT) for dementia care has grown steadily in recent years. However, RAT using humanoid robots is still a novel practice for which the adhesion mechanisms, indications and benefits remain unclear. Also, little is known about how the robot's behavioral and affective style might promote engagement of persons with dementia (PwD) in RAT. The present study sought to investigate the use of a humanoid robot in a psychomotor therapy for PwD. We examined the robot's potential to engage participants in the intervention and its effect on their emotional state. A brief psychomotor therapy program involving the robot as the therapist's assistant was created. For this purpose, a corpus of social and physical behaviors for the robot and a ""control software"" for customizing the program and operating the robot were also designed. Particular attention was given to components of the RAT that could promote participant's engagement (robot's interaction style, personalization of contents). In the pilot assessment of the intervention nine PwD (7 women and 2 men, M age = 86 y/o) hospitalized in a geriatrics unit participated in four individual therapy sessions: one classic therapy (CT) session (patient- therapist) and three RAT sessions (patient-therapist-robot). Outcome criteria for the evaluation of the intervention included: participant's engagement, emotional state and well-being; satisfaction of the intervention, appreciation of the robot, and empathy-related behaviors in human-robot interaction (HRI). Results showed a high constructive engagement in both CT and RAT sessions. More positive emotional responses in participants were observed in RAT compared to CT. RAT sessions were better appreciated than CT sessions. The use of a social robot as a mediating tool appeared to promote the involvement of PwD in the therapeutic intervention increasing their immediate wellbeing and satisfaction. © 2017 Rouaix, Retru-Chavastel, Rigaud, Monnet, Lenoir and Pino.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2017,"Rouaix, N.; Retru-Chavastel, L.; Rigaud, A.-S.; Monnet, C.; Lenoir, H.; Pino, M.",Frontiers in Psychology,,,QJ8KNHCS,10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00950,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85021340604&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2017.00950&partnerID=40&md5=76571d1aa765fd440c392484c9fc5bae,2017-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:35:25Z,2021-02-15T22:35:25Z,,,,JUN,8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 8</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,affective and engagement issues in the conception and assessment of a robot-assisted psychomotor therapy for persons with dementia,affective and engagement issues in the conception and assessment of a robotassisted psychomotor therapy for persons with dementia
,,,,,,,,,,Simulating empathic behavior in a social assistive robot,"When used as an interface in the context of Ambient Assisted Living (AAL), a social robot should not just provide a task-oriented support. It should also try to establish a social empathic relation with the user. To this aim, it is crucial to endow the robot with the capability of recognizing the user’s affective state and reason on it for triggering the most appropriate communicative behavior. In this paper we describe how such an affective reasoning has been implemented in the NAO robot for simulating empathic behaviors in the context of AAL. In particular, the robot is able to recognize the emotion of the user by analyzing communicative signals extracted from speech and facial expressions. The recognized emotion allows triggering the robot’s affective state and, consequently, the most appropriate empathic behavior. The robot’s empathic behaviors have been evaluated both by experts in communication and through a user study aimed at assessing the perception and interpretation of empathy by elderly users. Results are quite satisfactory and encourage us to further extend the social and affective capabilities of the robot. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2017,"De Carolis, B.; Ferilli, S.; Palestra, G.",Multimedia Tools and Applications,,,G46Y8JWD,10.1007/s11042-016-3797-0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84988691125&doi=10.1007%2fs11042-016-3797-0&partnerID=40&md5=3d3264938f9865faf7b3dd27a9d15393,2017-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:35:25Z,2021-02-15T22:35:25Z,,5073-5094,,4,76,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 15</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,simulating empathic behavior in a social assistive robot,simulating empathic behavior in a social assistive robot

In our previous studies, we have focused only on the robot's emotional state. However, the emotional state of the other party is also an important factor for smooth conversation in human society. Therefore, the robot partner has two emotional structures for human: empathy and robot emotion. First, human empathy uses a perceptual based emotion model to know the human's emotional state based on the sensory information. Next, we propose a recurrent simple spike response model to improve the robot's emotional model, and we apply ""Hebbian-LMS"" learning to modify the weights in the spiking neural network. The robot's emotional state is calculated by using the human's emotional information, internal and external information. The robot partner can use the emotional results to control the facial and gesture expression. The utterance style is also changed by the robot's emotional state. As a result, the robot partner can interact emotionally and naturally with human. First, we explain the related works and the development of the robot partner ""iPhonoid-C"". Next, we define the architecture of the emotional model to realize emotional empathy towards human. Then, we discuss the algorithms and the methods for developing the emotional model. Finally, we show experimental results of the proposed method, and discuss the effectiveness of the proposed structure.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2017,"Woo, J.; Botzheim, J.; Kubota, N.",Malaysian Journal of Computer Science,,,N5T72L6S,10.22452/mjcs.vol30no4.1,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85036526555&doi=10.22452%2fmjcs.vol30no4.1&partnerID=40&md5=7bf71955acddbdefa5deeff07d6d74dc,2017-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:35:25Z,2021-02-15T22:35:25Z,,258-285,,4,30,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 7</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,emotional empathy model for robot partners using recurrent spiking neural network model with hebbian-lms learning,emotional empathy model for robot partners using recurrent spiking neural network model with hebbianlms learning

The environment consists of a socially assistive robot, an auxiliary display, and a mobile device for teacher's intervention. The robot and the display are employed as mediators to give adequate affective feedbacks to children, which might not be possible among very young peers. The intervention device for teachers is employed to coach the robot on giving appropriate affective feedbacks according to the reaction of children. We intended to increase children's engagement on the activities and enhance their empathy while interacting with a friend-like robot than they do with an adult teacher. To verify the feasibility of the proposed design, we implemented an activity on emotional regulation strategies and performed a brief user study. The results clearly show that the participants prefer sociable mode of robot operation to still mode operation.

,,,,,,,,,,Do we need emotionally intelligent artificial agents? First results of human perceptions of emotional intelligence in humans compared to robots,"Humans are very apt at reading emotional signals in other humans and even artificial agents, which raises the question of whether artificial agents need to be emotionally intelligent to ensure effective social interactions. For artificial agents without emotional intelligence might generate behavior that is misinterpreted, unexpected, and confusing to humans, violating human expectations and possibly causing emotional harm. Surprisingly, there is a dearth of investigations aimed at understanding the extent to which artificial agents need emotional intelligence for successful interactions. Here, we present the first study in the perception of emotional intelligence (EI) in robots vs. humans. The objective was to determine whether people viewed robots as more or less emotionally intelligent when exhibiting similar behaviors as humans, and to investigate which verbal and nonverbal communication methods were most crucial for human observational judgments. Study participants were shown a scene in which either a robot or a human behaved with either high or low empathy, and then they were asked to evaluate the agent’s emotional intelligence and trustworthiness. The results showed that participants could consistently distinguish the high EI condition from the low EI condition regardless of the variations in which communication methods were observed, and that whether the agent was a robot or human had no effect on the perception. We also found that relative to low EI high EI conditions led to greater trust in the agent, which implies that we must design robots to be emotionally intelligent if we wish for users to trust them. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2017,"Fan, L.; Scheutz, M.; Lohani, M.; McCoy, M.; Stokes, C.",Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),,,MF9GB4SQ,10.1007/978-3-319-67401-8_15,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85029009078&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-319-67401-8_15&partnerID=40&md5=40847ef441d91c4b0c0d33b427b6059c,2017-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:35:25Z,2021-02-15T22:35:25Z,,129-141,,,10498 LNAI,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 8</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,do we need emotionally intelligent artificial agents? first results of human perceptions of emotional intelligence in humans compared to robots,do we need emotionally intelligent artificial agents first results of human perceptions of emotional intelligence in humans compared to robots
,,,,,,,,,,Appearance of a robot affects the impact of its behaviour on perceived trustworthiness and empathy,"An increasing number of companion robots have started reaching the public in the recent years. These robots vary in their appearance and behavior. Since these two factors can have an impact on lasting human-robot relationships, it is important to understand their effect for companion robots. We have conducted an experiment that evaluated the impact of a robot's appearance and its behaviour in repeated interactions on its perceived empathy, trustworthiness and anxiety experienced by a human. The results indicate that a highly humanlike robot is perceived as less trustworthy and empathic than a more machinelike robot. Moreover, negative behaviour of a machinelike robot reduces its trustworthiness and perceived empathy stronger than for highly humanlike robot. In addition, we found that a robot which disapproves of what a human says can induce anxiety felt towards its communication capabilities. Our findings suggest that more machinelike robots can be more suitable as companions than highly humanlike robots. Moreover, a robot disagreeing with a human interaction partner should be able to provide feedback on its understanding of the partner's message in order to reduce her anxiety. © 2016 Jakub Złotowski et al., published by De Gruyter Open.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2016,"Złotowski, J.; Sumioka, H.; Nishio, S.; Glas, D.F.; Bartneck, C.; Ishiguro, H.",Paladyn,,,KXP9KLH5,10.1515/pjbr-2016-0005,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018414278&doi=10.1515%2fpjbr-2016-0005&partnerID=40&md5=8b9b98387e70b4e30a81762b413ddb88,2016-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:35:25Z,2021-02-15T22:35:25Z,,55-66,,1,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 12</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,appearance of a robot affects the impact of its behaviour on perceived trustworthiness and empathy,appearance of a robot affects the impact of its behaviour on perceived trustworthiness and empathy

In facts, a principal defining characteristic of human social behaviour is empathy. The present paper presents a robotic architecture for an android robot as a basis for natural empathic humanandroid interaction. We start from the hypothesis that the robots, in order to become personal companions need to know how to empathic interact with human beings. To validate our research, we have used the proposed system with the minimalistic humanoid robot Telenoid. We have conducted human-robot interactions test with elderly people with no prior interaction experience with robot. During the experiment, elderly persons engaged a stimulated conversation with the humanoid robot. Our goal is to overcome the state of loneliness of elderly people using this minimalistic humanoid robot capable to exhibit a dialogue similar to what usually happens in real life between human beings.

Humor support is defined as the conversational strategies used in reaction to humor utterances. This paper aims at exploring the phenomenon of responses to humor interventions from the robot through the examination of a corpus. We assume that using humor in human-robot interaction sets up a positive atmosphere in which participants are willing to contribute. This study relies on 49 human-robot interaction dialogues and 381 adjacency pairs of humorous acts made by the robot and the following human responses. The human humor responses, elicited through canned jokes and conversational humor, were annotated. Three main categories of human responses were found (1) providing no support, (2) recognizing the attempt of humor and (3) contributing with more humor. The findings indicate that, as in human-human interaction, strategies of humor support are strongly dependent of the humorous event’s context. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2016,"Bechade, L.; Duplessis, G.D.; Devillers, L.",Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),,,9CSCB3M8,10.1007/978-3-319-39862-4_28,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84978870310&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-319-39862-4_28&partnerID=40&md5=1ef7ba186fefcb5c0b2d3249f892d26b,2016-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:35:26Z,2021-02-15T22:35:26Z,,305-316,,,9749,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 3</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,empirical study of humor support in social human-robot interaction,empirical study of humor support in social humanrobot interaction
,,,,,,,,,,The effects of cognitive biases in long-term human-robot interactions: Case studies using three cognitive biases on MARC the humanoid robot,"The research presented in this paper is part of a wider study investigating the role cognitive bias plays in developing long-term companionship between a robot and human. In this paper we discuss, how cognitive biases such as misattribution, Empathy gap and Dunning-Kruger effects can play a role in robot-human interaction with the aim of improving long-term companionship. One of the robots used in this study called MARC (See Fig. 1) was given a series of biased behaviours such as forgetting participant’s names, denying its own faults for failures, unable to understand what a participant is saying, etc. Such fallible behaviours were compared to a non-biased baseline behaviour. In the current paper, we present a comparison of two case studies using these biases and a non-biased algorithm. It is hoped that such humanlike fallible characteristics can help in developing a more natural and believable companionship between Robots and Humans. The results of the current experiments show that the participants initially warmed to the robot with the biased behaviours. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2016,"Biswas, M.; Murray, J.",Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),,,C43TSVNB,10.1007/978-3-319-47437-3_15,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84992530101&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-319-47437-3_15&partnerID=40&md5=04c0c77ee6491b684750e79ae72cd6c4,2016-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:35:26Z,2021-02-15T22:35:26Z,,148-158,,,9979 LNAI,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 1</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,the effects of cognitive biases in long-term human-robot interactions: case studies using three cognitive biases on marc the humanoid robot,the effects of cognitive biases in longterm humanrobot interactions case studies using three cognitive biases on marc the humanoid robot
,,,,,,,,,,A pupil response system using hemispherical displays for enhancing affective conveyance,"In human interaction and communication, not only verbal messages but also nonverbal behaviors such as facial expressions, body movements, gazes and pupil responses play an important role in expressions of talker’s affect. These expressions encourage to read the emotional cues and to cause the sharing of embodiment and empathy. We focused on the pupil response which is closely related to human affect, and developed an embodied communication system in which an interactive CG character generates the pupil response as well as communicative actions and movements such as nodding and body movements by speech input. In addition, it was confirmed that the pupil response is effective for supporting the embodied interaction and communication using the developed system. In this paper, in order to realize the smooth interaction between human and robot, we developed a pupil response system using hemispherical displays for enhancing affective conveyance. This system looks like robot’s eyeballs and expresses vivid pupil response by speech input. We carried out a sensory evaluation experiment under the condition that the developed system speaks. The results demonstrated that the system effectively enhances affective conveyance. © 2019 The Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2016,"Sejima, Y.; Egawa, S.; Sato, Y.; Watanabe, T.","Journal of Advanced Mechanical Design, Systems and Manufacturing",,,XHBMV458,10.1299/JAMDSM.2019JAMDSM0032,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85078309015&doi=10.1299%2fJAMDSM.2019JAMDSM0032&partnerID=40&md5=29a5562526052c2c6b4b3c50b9ee2dfb,2016-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:35:26Z,2021-02-15T22:35:26Z,,,,4,10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 0</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,a pupil response system using hemispherical displays for enhancing affective conveyance,a pupil response system using hemispherical displays for enhancing affective conveyance

We performed electroencephalography in 15 healthy adults who observed either human- or robot-hand pictures in painful or non-painful situations such as a finger cut by a knife. We found that the descending phase of the P3 component was larger for the painful stimuli than the non-painful stimuli, regardless of whether the hand belonged to a human or robot. In contrast, the ascending phase of the P3 component at the frontal-central electrodes was increased by painful human stimuli but not painful robot stimuli, though the interaction of ANOVA was not significant, but marginal. These results suggest that we empathize with humanoid robots in late top-down processing similarly to human others.

,,,,,,,,,,Testing Empathy with Robots: A Model in Four Dimensions and Sixteen Items,"The four-dimensional model of empathy presented in this paper addresses human–human, human–avatar and human–robot interaction, and aims at better understanding the specificities of the empathy that humans might develop towards robots. Its first dimension is auto-empathy and refers to an empathetic relationship with oneself: how can a human directing a robot expand the various components of empathy he feels for himself to this robot? The second is direct empathy: what does a human attribute to a robot in terms of thoughts, emotions, action potentials or even altruism, on the model of what he imagines and attributes to himself? The third dimension is reciprocal empathy that consists of thinking that a robot is able to identify with me, feel or guess my emotions and thoughts, anticipate my actions and wear me assistance if necessary. Finally, the fourth dimension, intersubjective empathy, is about thinking and imagining that a robot can inform me of things - emotions, thoughts that I am likely to experience- that I do not know about myself. Each of these four dimensions includes four different components: (1) Action (empathy of action), (2) Emotion (emotional empathy), (3) Cognition (cognitive empathy) and (4) Assistance (empathy of assistance). This theoretical model of empathy in four dimensions and four components defines sixteen items whose relevance will be tested in the near future through comparative experimental research involving human-human and human-robot interaction. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2015,"Tisseron, S.; Tordo, F.; Baddoura, R.",International Journal of Social Robotics,,,YVGHPNHK,10.1007/s12369-014-0268-5,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84924301513&doi=10.1007%2fs12369-014-0268-5&partnerID=40&md5=ae9ddda552ec58f57dc89db088c53239,2015-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:35:27Z,2021-02-15T22:35:27Z,,97-102,,1,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 3</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,testing empathy with robots: a model in four dimensions and sixteen items,testing empathy with robots a model in four dimensions and sixteen items
,,,,,,,,,,The Cognitive Bases of Anthropomorphism: From Relatedness to Empathy,"Humans may react very differently with respect to mechanical devices, including robots. They can interact with them with delight or retreat in aversion or fear. According to the famous model of the uncanny valley these opposite reactions depend on the degree of familiarity that different artifacts engender in humans. The aim of my work is trying to find out the cognitive bases of familiarity, analyzing the origin of anthropomorphic projection, namely human disposition to attribute anthropomorphic features - like intentions or feelings—to artifacts. I shall discuss two concepts: relatedness and empathy, and argue that relatedness is the precondition for empathy. The fact that it is possible to attribute anthropomorphic features virtually to any object shows that resemblance is not the point. Anthropomorphism is a kind of relation that humans establish with an artifact, and in order to comprehend this phenomenon we have to focus on the relational aspect. I shall argue that what we call anthropomorphism is an extension to nonhumans of forms of interactions typical of human communication, i.e. the attribution to an artifact of the position of interlocutor in a possible dialogue. It can be shown that attributing to an artifact the position of interlocutor in a dialogue implies dealing with it as if it were endowed of the features characterizing human mind, i.e. mental states and emotions. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2015,"Airenti, G.",International Journal of Social Robotics,,,SSB4S63F,10.1007/s12369-014-0263-x,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84924336727&doi=10.1007%2fs12369-014-0263-x&partnerID=40&md5=7771b24f56c2451979b51997da835912,2015-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:35:27Z,2021-02-15T22:35:27Z,,117-127,,1,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 21</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,the cognitive bases of anthropomorphism: from relatedness to empathy,the cognitive bases of anthropomorphism from relatedness to empathy
,,,,,,,,,,Influence of upper body pose mirroring in human-robot interaction,"This paper explores the effect of upper body pose mirroring in human-robot interaction. A group of participants is used to evaluate how imitation by a robot affects people’s perception of their conversation with it. A set of twelve questions about the participants’ university experience serves as a backbone for the dialogue structure. In our experimental evaluation, the robot reacts in one of three ways to the human upper body pose: ignoring it, displaying its own upper body pose, and mirroring it. The manner in which the robot behaviour influences human appraisal is analysed using the standard Godspeed questionnaire. Our results show that robot body mirroring/non-mirroring influences the perceived humanness of the robot. The results also indicate that body pose mirroring is an important factor in facilitating rapport and empathy in human social interactions with robots. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2015,"Fuente, L.A.; Ierardi, H.; Pilling, M.; Crook, N.T.",Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),,,JLFKUUAU,10.1007/978-3-319-25554-5_22,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84983598081&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-319-25554-5_22&partnerID=40&md5=3f7276e6bca1a0a0ba38bb00b597daee,2015-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:35:27Z,2021-02-15T22:35:27Z,,214-223,,,9388 LNCS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 7</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,influence of upper body pose mirroring in human-robot interaction,influence of upper body pose mirroring in humanrobot interaction

This paper presents a long-term public demonstration that encouraged interaction between a humanoid robot and unspecified individuals. We have collected a significant amount of subjective evaluation data from the public by performing a storytelling demonstration that enhanced people's empathy towards the robot. The evaluation model consists of the robot's human friendliness, which involves its impression on humans, interaction with humans, and imitation of human motions and the robot's human appearance which involves gender, age, height, and body type. This study shows that there is no significant difference in human-friendliness between gender groups (male and female), while there is a significant difference between age groups (children and adults). In human appearance, it appears that there is no significant difference between either gender groups or age groups, except for the case of the robot's height. © ICROS 2015.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2015,"Ahn, T.-B.; Kang, E.-S.","Journal of Institute of Control, Robotics and Systems",,,EZJQ3GD6,10.5302/J.ICROS.2015.15.0109,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84941275810&doi=10.5302%2fJ.ICROS.2015.15.0109&partnerID=40&md5=4fa5bf50debed289c455d163e9699f20,2015-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:35:27Z,2021-02-15T22:35:27Z,,849-857,,9,21,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 0</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,evaluation study of a human-sized bipedal humanoid robot through a public demonstration in a science museum,evaluation study of a humansized bipedal humanoid robot through a public demonstration in a science museum
,,,,,,,,,,Towards a robot computational model to preserve dignity in stigmatizing patient-caregiver relationships,"Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients with an expressive mask are particularly vulnerable to stigmatization during interactions with their caregivers due to their inability to express affect through nonverbal channels. Our approach to uphold PD patient dignity is through the use of an ethical robot that mediates patient shame when it recognizes norm violations in the patientcaregiver interaction. This paper presents the basis for a computational model tasked with computing patient shame and the empathetic response of a caregiver during “empathetic opportunities” in their interaction. A PD patient is liable to suffer indignity when there is a substantial difference between his experienced shame and the empathy shown by the caregiver. When this difference falls outside of acceptable set bounds (norms), the robotic agent will act using subtle, nonverbal cues to guide the relationship back within these bounds, preserving patient dignity. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2015,"Pettinati, M.J.; Arkin, R.C.",Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),,,F77AVV8P,10.1007/978-3-319-25554-5_53,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84983551906&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-319-25554-5_53&partnerID=40&md5=101e69f850eee5fb87938dd20f24c8b8,2015-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:35:28Z,2021-02-15T22:35:28Z,,532-542,,,9388 LNCS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 3</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,towards a robot computational model to preserve dignity in stigmatizing patient-caregiver relationships,towards a robot computational model to preserve dignity in stigmatizing patientcaregiver relationships
,,,,,,,,,,Moral ecology approaches to machine ethics,"Wallach and Allen’s seminal book, Moral Machines: Teaching Robots Right from Wrong, categorized theories of machine ethics by the types of algorithms each employs (e.g., top-down vs. bottom-up), ultimately concluding that a hybrid approach would be necessary. Humans are hybrids individually: our brains are wired to adapt our evaluative approach to our circumstances. For example, stressors can inhibit the action of oxytocin in the brain, thus forcing a nurse who usually acts from subjective empathy to defer to objective rules instead. In contrast, ecosystem approaches to ethics promote hybridization across, rather than within, individuals; the nurse being empowered to specialize in personalized care because other workers specialize in standardization, and profitability. Various philosophers have argued, or laid the framework to argue, that such specialization can be advantageous to teams and societies. Rather than mass-produce identical machines to emulate the best individual human, perhaps we should build diverse teams of machines to emulate the best human teams. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2015,"Santos-Lang, C.C.","Intelligent Systems, Control and Automation: Science and Engineering",,,XF9FGGCH,10.1007/978-3-319-08108-3_8,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84921383640&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-319-08108-3_8&partnerID=40&md5=a85fa6ea1a4880edfbb476c3505fd3d9,2015-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:35:28Z,2021-02-15T22:35:28Z,,111-127,,,74,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 3</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,moral ecology approaches to machine ethics,moral ecology approaches to machine ethics
,,,,,,,,,,Bridging the mechanical and the human mind: Spontaneous mimicry of a physically present android,"The spontaneous mimicry of others' emotional facial expressions constitutes a rudimentary form of empathy and facilitates social understanding. Here, we show that human participants spontaneously match facial expressions of an android physically present in the room with them. This mimicry occurs even though these participants find the android unsettling and are fully aware that it lacks intentionality. Interestingly, a video of that same android elicits weaker mimicry reactions, occurring only in participants who find the android ""humanlike."" These findings suggest that spontaneous mimicry depends on the salience of humanlike features highlighted by face-to-face contact, emphasizing the role of presence in human-robot interaction. Further, the findings suggest that mimicry of androids can dissociate from knowledge of artificiality and experienced emotional unease. These findings have implications for theoretical debates about the mechanisms of imitation. They also inform creation of future robots that effectively build rapport and engagement with their human users. © 2014 Hofree et al.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2014,"Hofree, G.; Ruvolo, P.; Bartlett, M.S.; Winkielman, P.",PLoS ONE,,,G3TYP25J,10.1371/journal.pone.0099934,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84904490592&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0099934&partnerID=40&md5=160e9e9b43fd8eecd3d04c3cb2e090d0,2014-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:35:28Z,2021-02-15T22:35:28Z,,,,7,9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 25</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,bridging the mechanical and the human mind: spontaneous mimicry of a physically present android,bridging the mechanical and the human mind spontaneous mimicry of a physically present android
,,,,,,,,,,Conditions of empathy in human-robot interaction,The purpose of this paper is to consider the sociality of social robots with the focus on the notion of empathy. Social robots are designed to exploit various biological mechanisms that trigger anthropomorphizing reactions in humans and systems that seem capable of experiencing or feeling are being constructed. A question is whether empathic reactions by humans are justifiable from a conceptual and ethical point of view. I will mainly address the conceptual strand of this question and investigate whether empathy with robots is appropriate or misapplied relative to our current concept of empathy. © 2014 The authors and IOS Press.

,,,,,,,,,,Making sense of empathy with social robots,"Social robots exploit human-like behaviors so that people might form emotional bonds with them. Ostensibly, such bonding is an empathic response on the part of the person toward the robot. However, as philosopher Catrin Misselhorn points out, it's conceptually problematic to say that people empathize with robots, for the social robots of the present arguably don't possess human-like emotions. To address this concern, Misselhorn proposes that empathy with robots is possible owing to a sort of interplay between perception and imagination that she calls 'imaginative perception.' In this paper, I shall make a preliminary sketch of a conceptual framework that, I argue, serves as a clearer, more conceptually straight-forward alternative to imaginative perception. On this framework, empathy with social robots is the result of a kind of perceptual illusion, rather than the result of the imaginative perception of emotion. © 2014 The authors and IOS Press.

Thus, it is necessary that Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) is designed in such a way that allows humans to communicate with robots effortlessly and naturally. Emotions play an important role in this interaction since humans feel more predisposed to interact with robots if they are able to create an affective bond with them. In this study, we want to know whether humans are able to empathize with a humanoid robot. Therefore, in the present research, we are going to recreate a Milgram experiment in which we expect participants to empathize with the robot while playing a matching game. Like in Milgram's experiment, they will have to give fake electrical shocks to the robot thinking that they are punishing it. In that way, an empathic state, which we expect to see in our results, may be induced. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2014,"Gou, M.S.; Vouloutsi, V.; Grechuta, K.; Lallée, S.; Verschure, P.F.M.J.",Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),,,WSMJR8MG,10.1007/978-3-319-09435-9_50,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84905240698&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-319-09435-9_50&partnerID=40&md5=feaef6aa957d395fb24bd3ed5dd63cdd,2014-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:35:29Z,2021-02-15T22:35:29Z,,423-426,,,8608 LNAI,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 2</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,empathy in humanoid robots,empathy in humanoid robots
,,,,,,,,,,Autistic traits modulate mimicry of social but not nonsocial rewards,"Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC) are associated with diminished responsiveness to social stimuli, and especially to social rewards such as smiles. Atypical responsiveness to social rewards, which reinforce socially appropriate behavior in children, can potentially lead to a cascade of deficits in social behavior. Individuals with ASC often show diminished spontaneous mimicry of social stimuli in a natural setting. In the general population, mimicry is modulated both by the reward value and the sociality of the stimulus (i.e., whether the stimulus is perceived to belong to a conspecific or an inanimate object). Since empathy and autistic traits are distributed continuously in the general population, this study aimed to test if and how these traits modulated automatic mimicry of rewarded social and nonsocial stimuli. High and low rewards were associated with human and robot hands using a conditioned learning paradigm. Thirty-six participants from the general population then completed a mimicry task involving performing a prespecified hand movement which was either compatible or incompatible with a hand movement presented to the participant. High autistic traits (measured using the Autism Spectrum Quotient, AQ) predicted lesser mimicry of high-reward than low-reward conditioned human hands, whereas trait empathy showed an opposite pattern of correlations. No such relations were observed for high-reward vs. low-reward conditioned robot hands. These results demonstrate how autistic traits and empathy modulate the effects of reward on mimicry of social compared to nonsocial stimuli. This evidence suggests a potential role for the reward system in underlying the atypical social behavior in individuals with ASC, who constitute the extreme end of the spectrum of autistic traits. © 2013 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2013,"Haffey, A.; Press, C.; O'Connell, G.; Chakrabarti, B.",Autism Research,,,TIL9C6DU,10.1002/aur.1323,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84890791615&doi=10.1002%2faur.1323&partnerID=40&md5=92c1fa7dd324146ab56c658894e4a084,2013-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:35:29Z,2021-02-15T22:35:29Z,,614-620,,6,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 14</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,autistic traits modulate mimicry of social but not nonsocial rewards,autistic traits modulate mimicry of social but not nonsocial rewards
,,,,,,,,,,Increasing Helpfulness towards a Robot by Emotional Adaption to the User,"This article describes an emotional adaption approach to proactively trigger increased helpfulness towards a robot in task-related human-robot interaction (HRI). Based on social-psychological predictions of human behavior, the approach aims at inducing empathy, paired with a feeling of similarity in human users towards the robot. This is achieved by two differently expressed emotional control variables: by an explicit statement of similarity before task-related interaction, and implicitly expressed by adapting the emotional state of the robot to the mood of the human user, such that the current values of the human mood in the dimensions of pleasure, arousal, and dominance (PAD) are matched. The thereby shifted emotional state of the robot serves as a basis for the generation of task-driven emotional facial- and verbal expressions, employed to induce and sustain high empathy towards the robot throughout the interaction. The approach is evaluated in a user study utilizing an expressive robot head. The effectiveness of the approach is confirmed by significant experimental results. An analysis of the individual components of the approach reveals significant effects of explicit emotional adaption on helpfulness, as well as on the HRI-key concepts anthropomorphism and animacy. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2013,"Kühnlenz, B.; Sosnowski, S.; Buß, M.; Wollherr, D.; Kühnlenz, K.; Buss, M.",International Journal of Social Robotics,,,BAGXIXSX,10.1007/s12369-013-0182-2,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84886781468&doi=10.1007%2fs12369-013-0182-2&partnerID=40&md5=3841f37f6837c58790a3c7feae6fd93f,2013-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:35:29Z,2021-02-15T22:35:29Z,,457-476,,4,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 30</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,increasing helpfulness towards a robot by emotional adaption to the user,increasing helpfulness towards a robot by emotional adaption to the user
,,,,,,,,,,Toward socially responsible agents: Integrating attachment and learning in emotional decision-making,"Our goal is to create socially responsible agents, either robots or virtual humans. In this paper, we present an integration of emotions, attachment, and learning in emotional decision-making to achieve this goal. Based on emerging psychological theories, we aim at building human-like emotional decision-making, where emotions play a central role in selecting the next action to be performed by the agent. Here, we present our own approach for emotion appraisal where we use emotional attachment as an important impulse for determining the intensities of emotions. Emotions in their turn are used to calculate the emotional attachment toward the users and for learning to predict future consequences. We report on the results of a simulation evaluation where we assess the influence of emotions, attachment, and learning on decision-making. It is our strong belief that by giving an agent the ability to have emotions and to feel empathy and emotional attachment toward others, we will ultimately give this agent the ability to learn and improve its social behavior skills through interactions with the users and through user feedback.

,,,,,,,,,,"Making Social Robots More Attractive: The Effects of Voice Pitch, Humor and Empathy","In this paper we explore how simple auditory/verbal features of the spoken language, such as voice characteristics (pitch) and language cues (empathy/humor expression) influence the quality of interaction with a social robot receptionist. For our experiment two robot characters were created: Olivia, the more extrovert, exuberant, and humorous robot with a higher voice pitch and Cynthia, the more introvert, calmer and more serious robot with a lower voice pitch. Our results showed that the voice pitch seemed to have a strong influence on the way users rated the overall interaction quality, as well as the robot's appeal and overall enjoyment. Further, the humor appeared to improve the users' perception of task enjoyment, robot personality and speaking style while the empathy showed effects on the way users evaluated the robot's receptive behavior and the interaction ease. With our study, we would like to stress in particular the importance of voice pitch in human robot interaction and to encourage further research on this topic. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2013,"Niculescu, A.; van Dijk, B.; Nijholt, A.; Li, H.; See, S.L.",International Journal of Social Robotics,,,EPK69ADW,10.1007/s12369-012-0171-x,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84876427330&doi=10.1007%2fs12369-012-0171-x&partnerID=40&md5=e5170bc6f627cbe2b4e6b47229b7ac0e,2013-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:35:30Z,2021-02-15T22:35:30Z,,171-191,,2,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 82</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,"making social robots more attractive: the effects of voice pitch, humor and empathy",making social robots more attractive the effects of voice pitch humor and empathy
,,,,,,,,,,EEG theta and Mu oscillations during perception of human and robot actions,"The perception of others' actions supports important skills such as communication, intention understanding, and empathy. Are mechanisms of action processing in the human brain specifically tuned to process biological agents? Humanoid robots can perform recognizable actions, but can look and move differently from humans, and as such, can be used in experiments to address such questions. Here, we recorded EEG as participants viewed actions performed by three agents. In the Human condition, the agent had biological appearance and motion. The other two conditions featured a state-of-the-art robot in two different appearances: Android, which had biological appearance but mechanical motion, and Robot, which had mechanical appearance and motion. We explored whether sensorimotor mu (8-13 Hz) and frontal theta (4-8 Hz) activity exhibited selectivity for biological entities, in particular for whether the visual appearance and/or the motion of the observed agent was biological. Sensorimotor mu suppression has been linked to the motor simulation aspect of action processing (and the human mirror neuron system, MNS), and frontal theta to semantic and memory-related aspects. For all three agents, action observation induced significant attenuation in the power of mu oscillations, with no difference between agents. Thus, mu suppression, considered an index of MNS activity, does not appear to be selective for biological agents. Observation of the Robot resulted in greater frontal theta activity compared to the Android and the Human, whereas the latter two did not differ from each other. Frontal theta thus appears to be sensitive to visual appearance, suggesting agents that are not sufficiently biological in appearance may result in greater memory processing demands for the observer. Studies combining robotics and neuroscience such as this one can allow us to explore neural basis of action processing on the one hand, and inform the design of social robots on the other. © 2013 Urgen, Plank, Ishiguro, Poizner and Saygin. © 2013 Urgen, Plank, Ishiguro, Poizner and Saygin.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2013,"Urgen, B.A.; Plank, M.; Ishiguro, H.; Poizner, H.; Saygin, A.P.",Frontiers in Neurorobotics,,,I7GNT6M2,10.3389/fnbot.2013.00019,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84899682291&doi=10.3389%2ffnbot.2013.00019&partnerID=40&md5=b4aae2154c5beca9ef9fffd9bde2d77a,2013-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:35:30Z,2021-02-15T22:35:30Z,,,,NOV,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 34</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,eeg theta and mu oscillations during perception of human and robot actions,eeg theta and mu oscillations during perception of human and robot actions
,,,,,,,,,,Should empathic social robots have interiority?,"In this article we discuss whether robots need ""interiority"" in order to competently participate in emotional and empathic dynamics with human partners. We draw on original research on emotions, mind, neurophysiological mechanisms of social interaction and HRI to contest the common sense thesis according to which robots without ""interiority"" can only simulate emotions and empathy, to the extent that the affective (emotional and empathic) relationships between them and humans would not be authentic. The main thesis of our article is that empathic social robots do not need ""interiority"", but the ability of dynamical coordination with their social partners and the surrounding environment(s), since this ability (and not ""interiority"") is at the basis of human cognitive and affective (emotional and empathic) activity. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2012,"Damiano, L.; Dumouchel, P.; Lehmann, H.",Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),,,QWJUGWJT,10.1007/978-3-642-34103-8_27,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84868703579&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-642-34103-8_27&partnerID=40&md5=273e4818c6cd8d4ff043f7c125f0658c,2012-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:35:30Z,2021-02-15T22:35:30Z,,268-277,,,7621 LNAI,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 3</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,should empathic social robots have interiority?,should empathic social robots have interiority
,,,,,,,,,,Using speech data to recognize emotion in human gait,"Robots that can recognize emotions can improve humans' mental health by providing empathy and social communication. Emotion recognition by robots is challenging because unlike in human-computer environments, facial information is not always available. Instead, our method proposes using speech and gait analysis to recognize human emotion. Previous research suggests that the dynamics of emotional human speech also underlie emotional gait (walking). We investigate the possibility of combining these two modalities via perceptually common parameters: Speed, Intensity, irRegularity, and Extent (SIRE). We map low-level features to this 4D cross-modal emotion space and train a Gaussian Mixture Model using independent samples from both voice and gait. Our results show that a single, modality-mixed trained model can perform emotion recognition for both modalities. Most interestingly, recognition of emotion in gait using a model trained uniquely on speech data gives comparable results to a model trained on gait data alone, providing evidence for a common underlying model for emotion across modalities. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2012,"Lim, A.; Okuno, H.G.",Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),,,VBUMQVMH,10.1007/978-3-642-34014-7_5,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84867628984&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-642-34014-7_5&partnerID=40&md5=7ab30baab585123d34f2f79cae6da69f,2012-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:35:30Z,2021-02-15T22:35:30Z,,52-64,,,7559 LNCS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 9</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,using speech data to recognize emotion in human gait,using speech data to recognize emotion in human gait

According to Masahiro Mori, a robotics professor at the Tokyo Institute of Technology, who first researched on this subject, a person's response to a humanlike robot would abruptly shift from empathy to revulsion as it approached, but failed to attain, a lifelike appearance. This descent into eeriness is known as the uncanny valley. As healthy persons, we are represented at the second peak (moving). Then when we die, we are unable to move; the body goes cold, and the face becomes pale. Therefore, our death can be regarded as a movement from the second peak (moving) to the bottom of the uncanny valley (still).

,,,,,,,,,,Empathy and the robot: A neuroanthropological analysis,"Roboticists developing socially interactive robots seek to design them in such a way that humans will readily anthropomorphize them. For this anthropomorphizing to occur, robots need to display emotion-like responses to elicit empathy from the person, so as to enable social interaction. This article focuses on roboticists' efforts to create emotion-like responses in humanoid robots. In particular, I investigate the extent to which the cultural dimensions of emotion and empathy are factored into these endeavors. Recent research suggests that mirror neurons or other brain structures may have a role to play in empathy and imitation. Notwithstanding this, the effect of sociocultural experience in shaping appropriate empathic responses and expectations is also crucial. More broadly, this article highlights how we are literally anthropomorphizing technology, even as the complexity of technology and the role it plays in our lives grows. Both the actual design process and the understanding of how technology shapes our daily lives are core applied dimensions of this work, from carrying out the research to capturing the critical implications of these technological innovations. © 2012 by the American Anthropological Association.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2012,"Glaskin, K.",Annals of Anthropological Practice,,,W5C5JS63,10.1111/j.2153-9588.2012.01093.x,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84866548084&doi=10.1111%2fj.2153-9588.2012.01093.x&partnerID=40&md5=59405e41826fbe02a20a7f7938bacf29,2012-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:35:30Z,2021-02-15T22:35:30Z,,68-87,,1,36,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 4</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,empathy and the robot: a neuroanthropological analysis,empathy and the robot a neuroanthropological analysis

Part of the problem might arise from the lack of experiences of so-called ""monozukuri"" or engineering design activities at elementary school levels. Hands on class room activities for elementary schools are developed including the followings. 1)Visual contents including robots in the real world, earthquake disasters, and robots engaging in rescue missions, 2)Using the same kind of body frame of the vehicle robot, four different types of prototype cars are prepared, which enable pupils to find the difference of the effect of gear-ratio, 3)Small cardboard parts called ""parts card"" for each component of the robot which enables pupils to develop their design by manipulating and placing the card to the body frame, 4)Mechanical models varying from simple to complex, multi-link structures. The results of the pre-post questionnaire shows that over 70% of pupils have positive feelings to ""monozukuri"" and shows 10% increase. The parts card facilitates design resulting that almost all design requires only minor modification. The image map method is used, the numbers of the concepts are increased by four points and its quality is improved. One of the objectives of this project is to enhance empathy; the ability to relate well to others.

,,,,,,,,,,Artificial companions: Empathy and vulnerability mirroring in human-robot relations,"Under what conditions can robots become companions and what are the ethical issues that might arise in human-robot companionship relations? I argue that the possibility and future of robots as companions depends (among other things) on the robot's capacity to be a recipient of human empathy, and that one necessary condition for this to happen is that the robot mirrors human vulnerabilities. For the purpose of these arguments, I make a distinction between empathy-as-cognition and empathy-as-feeling, connecting the latter to the moral sentiment tradition and its concept of ""fellow feeling."" Furthermore, I sympathise with the intuition that vulnerability mirroring raises the ethical issue of deception. However, given the importance of appearance in social relations, problems with the concept of deception, and contemporary technologies that question the artificial-natural distinction, we cannot easily justify the underlying assumptions of the deception objection. If we want to hold on to them, we need convincing answers to these problems. © 2011 Berkeley Electronic Press.

Our idea is that social referencing as well as facial expression recognition can emerge from a simple sensori-motor system involving emotional stimuli. Without knowing that the other is an agent, the robot is able to learn some complex tasks if the human partner has some ""empathy"" or at least ""resonate"" with the robot head (low level emotional resonance). Hence we advocate the idea that social referencing can be bootstrapped from a simple sensori-motor system not dedicated to social interactions. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2010,"Boucenna, S.; Gaussier, P.; Hafemeister, L.; Bard, K.",Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),,,XIAVPMT4,10.1007/978-3-642-15193-4_59,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-78249265355&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-642-15193-4_59&partnerID=40&md5=14ed2d292c580e3cbfc3fb0f93322108,2010-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:35:32Z,2021-02-15T22:35:32Z,,628-638,,,6226 LNAI,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 8</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,autonomous development of social referencing skills,autonomous development of social referencing skills

Although human-machine communication research suggests that humans can develop feelings for computers, this does not automatically imply that humans experience feelings of friendship with a chatbot. In this longitudinal study, 118 participants had seven interactions with chatbot Mitsuku over a 3-week period. After each interaction participants filled out a questionnaire. The results showed that the social processes decreased after each interaction and feelings of friendship were low. In line with the ABCDE model of relationship development, the social processes that aid relationship continuation decrease, leading to deterioration of the relationship. Furthermore, a novelty effect was at play after the first interaction, after which the chatbot became predictable and the interactions less enjoyable. © The Author(s) 2020.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2021,"Croes, E.A.J.; Antheunis, M.L.",Journal of Social and Personal Relationships,,,Q44YH8TT,10.1177/0265407520959463,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85091422686&doi=10.1177%2f0265407520959463&partnerID=40&md5=7a1fafb08fcca7eb9c8e2df2e58c3779,2021-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:35:55Z,2021-02-15T22:35:55Z,,279-300,,1,38,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 1</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,can we be friends with mitsuku? a longitudinal study on the process of relationship formation between humans and a social chatbot,can we be friends with mitsuku a longitudinal study on the process of relationship formation between humans and a social chatbot

Granting to this target population a longer and healthier life is paramount for the European Community. In the context of the H2020 EU funded project “NESTORE” [11], an embodied and ubiquitous e-coach is being developed seeking to change the lifestyle of seniors in different domains of wellbeing. NESTORE e-coach is known as a personalized embodied and ubiquitous e-coach that plays three essential roles in elderly’s wellbeing: a coach, a friend and a companion. As a coach, NESTORE will give trainings and advice following a wellbeing path that is proposed by experts in wellbeing. As a friend, this e-coach knows and understands the user. As a companion, this e-coach has the ability to detect the user’s emotion and aims at building empathy with the user based by providing support throughout their daily training. The NESTORE e-coach is based on three different intervention medium: a mobile application, a chatbot and an embodied vocal assistant. These interfaces have different forms, different capabilities and different visions. Users can communicate with the NESTORE e-coach through different interfaces exclusively, sequentially, concurrently and synergistically. The interaction can be initiated from the user side to different interfaces and/or from the e-coach side. In this paper, we present the NESTORE’s full vision for building the three essential roles of this e-coach which are: a coach, a companion and a friend for seniors. Furthermore, we explain the NESTORE system design, architecture, capabilities and how the different interfaces of this E-coach contribute to make a multi-modal system.

EI, and its component, can be improved with training, but currently the process is less flexible and very time-consuming. Machine learning (ML), on the other hand, can analyse huge amount of data to discover useful trends and patterns in shortest time possible. Despite the benefits, ML usage in EI training is scarce. In this paper, we studied 92 journal articles to discover the trend of the ML utilisation in the study of EI and its components. This survey aims to pave way for future studies that could lead to implementation of ML in EI training, and to rope in researchers in psychology and computer science to find possibilities of having a generic ML algorithm for every EI’s components. Our findings show an increasing trend to apply ML on EI components, and Support Vector Machine and Neural Network are the two most popular ML algorithms used in those researches. We also found that social skill and empathy are the least exposed EI components to ML.

Users, on a restaurant guide site, utilize IDs to post their recommendation articles on restaurants, and these posted articles are a valuable information source for other users. Open users can search for restaurants and read recommendation articles posted by other users. Furthermore, they can react (e.g., “like”) to a recommendation article when they feel it is helpful or they feel like visiting the restaurant. On a target restaurant guide site, each post includes the user ID, restaurant name, recommendation sentences, etc., and the number of reactions is considered to depend on these posted contents. For users who post recommendation articles, the number of reactions to their posts represents the degree of empathy from other users and is an important motivation for posting. Therefore, posting users will benefit from guidelines on how to write good recommendation sentences to increase the number of reactions. Moreover, the number of reactions can be regarded as an important indicator of the activity level of the restaurant guide site from the viewpoint of the service operating company. Therefore, an analytical model developed using historical information such as posts and reactions by users would be useful for determining the relationship between posted contents and the number of reactions. Therefore, this paper proposes a model based on the machine learning approach to analyze the relation between the number of reactions and posted contents. Finally, we demonstrate the analysis based on the proposed model using practical data. © 2020 KIIE",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2020,"Sakamoto, T.; Yamashita, H.; Goto, M.; Iwanaga, J.",Industrial Engineering and Management Systems,,,BTPHMBAB,10.7232/iems.2020.19.3.669,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85093862693&doi=10.7232%2fiems.2020.19.3.669&partnerID=40&md5=fdb2e6a9bbce1d4cf8653879ff665693,2020-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:36:21Z,2021-02-15T22:36:21Z,,669-679,,3,19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 0</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,model for relational analysis of posted articles and reactions on restaurant guide sites,model for relational analysis of posted articles and reactions on restaurant guide sites

The assessment of our psychological traits is a useful tool when we require them to simulate empathy. Since the creation of social media platforms, numerous studies dealt with measuring personality traits by gathering users' information from their social media profiles. Real world applications showed how natural language processing combined with supervised machine learning algorithms are effective in this field. These applications have some limitations such as focusing on English text only and not considering polysemy in text. In this paper, we propose a multilingual model that handles polysemy by analyzing sentences as a semantic ensemble of interconnected words. The proposed approach processes Facebook posts from the myPersonality dataset and it turns them into a high-dimensional array of features, which are then exploited by a deep neural network architecture based on transformer to perform regression. We prove the effectiveness of our work by comparing the mean squared error of our model with existing baselines and the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the relative data distributions.

,,,,,,,,,,Predicting Empathy From Resting State Brain Connectivity: A Multivariate Approach,"Recent task fMRI studies suggest that individual differences in trait empathy and empathic concern are mediated by patterns of connectivity between self-other resonance and top-down control networks that are stable across task demands. An untested implication of this hypothesis is that these stable patterns of connectivity should be visible even in the absence of empathy tasks. Using machine learning, we demonstrate that patterns of resting state fMRI connectivity (i.e. the degree of synchronous BOLD activity across multiple cortical areas in the absence of explicit task demands) of resonance and control networks predict trait empathic concern (n = 58). Empathic concern was also predicted by connectivity patterns within the somatomotor network. These findings further support the role of resonance-control network interactions and of somatomotor function in our vicariously driven concern for others. Furthermore, a practical implication of these results is that it is possible to assess empathic predispositions in individuals without needing to perform conventional empathy assessments. © Copyright © 2020 Christov-Moore, Reggente, Douglas, Feusner and Iacoboni.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2020,"Christov-Moore, L.; Reggente, N.; Douglas, P.K.; Feusner, J.D.; Iacoboni, M.",Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience,,,AP9VEHZU,10.3389/fnint.2020.00003,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85081050035&doi=10.3389%2ffnint.2020.00003&partnerID=40&md5=14a6c372c5d3617e327c91f2225d221e,2020-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:36:22Z,2021-02-15T22:36:22Z,,,,,14,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 4</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,predicting empathy from resting state brain connectivity: a multivariate approach,predicting empathy from resting state brain connectivity a multivariate approach
,,,,,,,,,,Assessing Risk Among Correctional Community Probation Populations: Predicting Reoffense With Mobile Neurocognitive Assessment Software,"We seek to address current limitations of forensic risk assessments by introducing the first mobile, self-scoring, risk assessment software that relies on neurocognitive testing to predict reoffense. This assessment, run entirely on a tablet, measures decision-making via a suite of neurocognitive tests in less than 30 minutes. The software measures several cognitive and decision-making traits of the user, including impulsivity, empathy, aggression, and several other traits linked to reoffending. Our analysis measured whether this assessment successfully predicted recidivism by testing probationers in a large urban city (Houston, TX, United States) from 2017 to 2019. To determine predictive validity, we used machine learning to yield cross-validated receiver–operator characteristics. Results gave a recidivism prediction value of 0.70, making it comparable to commonly used risk assessments. This novel approach diverges from traditional self-reporting, interview-based, and criminal-records-based approaches, and can also add a protective layer against bias, while strengthening model accuracy in predicting reoffense. In addition, subjectivity is eliminated and time-consuming administrative efforts are reduced. With continued data collection, this approach opens the possibility of identifying different levels of recidivism risk, by crime type, for any age, or gender, and seeks to steer individuals appropriately toward rehabilitative programs.

However, studies investigating social cognition, such as empathy and its underlying neural basis, are lacking. To explore the neural interactions among reward and memory circuits, we applied effective connectivity analysis on resting-state fMRI data collected from cocaine-dependent subjects. The relationship between effective connectivity within these two important circuits and empathy ability - evaluated with the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) - was assessed by machine learning algorithm using multivariate regression analysis. In accordance with the neurocircuitry disruptions of cocaine addiction, the results showed that cocaine-dependent subjects relative to healthy controls had altered resting state effective connectivity between parts of the memory and reward systems. Furthermore, effective connectivity between the memory and reward system could predict the fantasy empathy (FE) subscale scores in cocaine dependence. Overall, our findings provide further evidence for the neural substrates of social cognition in cocaine-dependent patients. These new insights could be useful for the development of new treatment programs for this substance dependency disorder. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2020,"Wei, L.; Wu, G.-R.; Bi, M.; Baeken, C.",Brain Imaging and Behavior,,,RI727WS3,10.1007/s11682-020-00354-y,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088566060&doi=10.1007%2fs11682-020-00354-y&partnerID=40&md5=835728f0a909b8384890b1442ede8006,2020-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:36:22Z,2021-02-15T22:36:22Z,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 0</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,effective connectivity predicts cognitive empathy in cocaine addiction: a spectral dynamic causal modeling study,effective connectivity predicts cognitive empathy in cocaine addiction a spectral dynamic causal modeling study

,,,,,,,,,,Increased similarity of neural responses to experienced and empathic distress in costly altruism,"Empathy—affective resonance with others’ sensory or emotional experiences—is hypothesized to be an important precursor to altruism. However, it is not known whether real-world altruists’ heightened empathy reflects true self-other mapping of multi-voxel neural response patterns. We investigated this relationship in adults who had engaged in extraordinarily costly real-world altruism: donating a kidney to a stranger. Altruists and controls completed fMRI testing while anticipating and experiencing pain, and watching as a stranger anticipated and experienced pain. Machine learning classifiers tested for shared representation between experienced and observed distress. Altruists exhibited more similar representations of experienced and observed fearful anticipation spontaneously and following an empathy prompt in anterior insula and anterior/middle cingulate cortex, respectively, suggesting heightened empathic proclivities and abilities for fear. During pain epochs, altruists were distinguished by spontaneous empathic responses in anterior insula, anterior/mid-cingulate cortex and supplementary motor area, but showed no difference from controls after the empathy prompt. These findings (1) link shared multi-voxel representations of the distress of self and others to real-world costly altruism, (2) reinforce distinctions between empathy for sensory states like pain and anticipatory affective states like fear, and (3) highlight the importance of differentiating between the proclivity and ability to empathize. © 2019, The Author(s).",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2019,"O’Connell, K.; Brethel-Haurwitz, K.M.; Rhoads, S.A.; Cardinale, E.M.; Vekaria, K.M.; Robertson, E.L.; Walitt, B.; VanMeter, J.W.; Marsh, A.A.",Scientific Reports,,,WQ6RPE3N,10.1038/s41598-019-47196-3,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85069733023&doi=10.1038%2fs41598-019-47196-3&partnerID=40&md5=d20042af6e49a051649ad067549d4110,2019-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:36:22Z,2021-02-15T22:36:22Z,,,,1,9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 3</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,increased similarity of neural responses to experienced and empathic distress in costly altruism,increased similarity of neural responses to experienced and empathic distress in costly altruism
,,,,,,,,,,From face to face: the contribution of facial mimicry to cognitive and emotional empathy,"Despite advances in the conceptualisation of facial mimicry, its role in the processing of social information is a matter of debate. In the present study, we investigated the relationship between mimicry and cognitive and emotional empathy. To assess mimicry, facial electromyography was recorded for 70 participants while they completed the Multifaceted Empathy Test, which presents complex context-embedded emotional expressions. As predicted, inter-individual differences in emotional and cognitive empathy were associated with the level of facial mimicry. For positive emotions, the intensity of the mimicry response scaled with the level of state emotional empathy. Mimicry was stronger for the emotional empathy task compared to the cognitive empathy task. The specific empathy condition could be successfully detected from facial muscle activity at the level of single individuals using machine learning techniques. These results support the view that mimicry occurs depending on the social context as a tool to affiliate and it is involved in cognitive as well as emotional empathy. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

,,,,,,,,,,"Design feasibility of an automated, machine-learning based feedback system for motivational interviewing","Direct observation of psychotherapy and providing performance-based feedback is the gold-standard approach for training psychotherapists. At present, this requires experts and training human coding teams, which is slow, expensive, and labor intensive. Machine learning and speech signal processing technologies provide a way to scale up feedback in psychotherapy. We evaluated an initial proof of concept automated feedback system that generates motivational interviewing quality metrics and provides easy access to other session data (e.g., transcripts). The system automatically provides a report of session-level metrics (e.g., therapist empathy) and therapist behavior codes at the talk-turn level (e.g., reflections). We assessed usability, therapist satisfaction, perceived accuracy, and intentions to adopt. A sample of 21 novice (n = 10) or experienced (n = 11) therapists each completed a 10-min session with a standardized patient. The system received the audio from the session as input and then automatically generated feedback that therapists accessed via a web portal. All participants found the system easy to use and were satisfied with their feedback, 83% found the feedback consistent with their own perceptions of their clinical performance, and 90% reported they were likely to use the feedback in their practice.

,,,,,,,,,,Empathic Neural Responses Predict Group Allegiance,"Watching another person in pain activates brain areas involved in the sensation of our own pain. Importantly, this neural mirroring is not constant; rather, it is modulated by our beliefs about their intentions, circumstances, and group allegiances. We investigated if the neural empathic response is modulated by minimally-differentiating information (e.g., a simple text label indicating another's religious belief), and if neural activity changes predict ingroups and outgroups across independent paradigms. We found that the empathic response was larger when participants viewed a painful event occurring to a hand labeled with their own religion (ingroup) than to a hand labeled with a different religion (outgroup). Counterintuitively, the magnitude of this bias correlated positively with the magnitude of participants' self-reported empathy. A multivariate classifier, using mean activity in empathy-related brain regions as features, discriminated ingroup from outgroup with 72% accuracy; the classifier's confidence correlated with belief certainty. This classifier generalized successfully to validation experiments in which the ingroup condition was based on an arbitrary group assignment. Empathy networks thus allow for the classification of long-held, newly-modified and arbitrarily-formed ingroups and outgroups. This is the first report of a single machine learning model on neural activation that generalizes to multiple representations of ingroup and outgroup. The current findings may prove useful as an objective diagnostic tool to measure the magnitude of one's group affiliations, and the effectiveness of interventions to reduce ingroup biases. © 2018 Vaughn, Savjani, Cohen and Eagleman.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2018,"Vaughn, D.A.; Savjani, R.R.; Cohen, M.S.; Eagleman, D.M.",Frontiers in Human Neuroscience,,,KXP3RPKI,10.3389/fnhum.2018.00302,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054818270&doi=10.3389%2ffnhum.2018.00302&partnerID=40&md5=b969317edbd81945e006fad82823c283,2018-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:36:23Z,2021-02-15T22:36:23Z,,,,,12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 3</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,empathic neural responses predict group allegiance,empathic neural responses predict group allegiance
,,,,,,,,,,Estimation of evocation of friendship based on similarity of pulse rate variability of users for event-based social networks,"In contrast to traditional social network services (SNSs), event-based social networks determine close friendships (CFs) of users who share experiences and emotions with candidate friends in offline events. However, we could not provide feedback to cyberspace regarding the place, time, and target of a user realizing friendship since there is no technique for conveniently measuring the evocation of friendship during offline events. In this research, we propose a method of estimating the evocation of friendship using the similarity in the pulse rate variabilities (PRVs) of users when empathy is evoked between them. The user can be made aware of friendship estimated automatically through machine learning by wearing a wristwatch-type pulsimeter. CFs are more likely to evoke empathy than superficial friendships (SFs). To demonstrate the usefulness of this method, we conducted an experiment assuming an event where a group of four people are enjoying their time in an amusement park. From the experimental results, we showed that the similarity of the PRVs in CFs is greater than that in SFs when the favorability rating is high and the users like each other. Moreover, we showed that the proposed method estimated the evocation of friendship during the attraction experience with an f-measure of 0.74 at maximum and during an offline event with a mean f-measure of 0.78. The results showed the usefulness and effectiveness of this method. © MYU K.K.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2018,"Kajiwara, Y.; Kubo, Y.; Kimura, H.",Sensors and Materials,,,RKD5ZDNY,10.18494/SAM.2018.1777,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85049905275&doi=10.18494%2fSAM.2018.1777&partnerID=40&md5=4bfc723f0e62ef5c77681b965445a2a1,2018-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:36:24Z,2021-02-15T22:36:24Z,,1407-1426,,7,30,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 0</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,estimation of evocation of friendship based on similarity of pulse rate variability of users for event-based social networks,estimation of evocation of friendship based on similarity of pulse rate variability of users for eventbased social networks
,,,,,,,,,,Perceived social support in adults with autism spectrum disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder,"Perceived social support (PSS) has been related to physical and mental well-being in typically developing individuals, but systematic characterizations of PSS in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are limited. We compared self-report ratings of the multidimensional scale of PSS (MSPSS) among age- and IQ-matched groups of adults (18–58 years) with cognitively high-functioning ASD (N = 41), or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; N = 69), and neurotypical controls (NC; N = 69). Accompanying group comparisons, we used machine learning random forest (RF) analyses to explore predictors among a range of psychopathological and socio-emotional variables. Relative to both ADHD and NC, adults with ASD showed lower MSPSS ratings, specifically for the friends subscale (MSPSS-f). Across ASD and ADHD, interindividual differences in autism severity, affective empathy, symptoms of anxiety related to social interactions, hyperactivity/impulsivity, and somatization best predicted MSPSS-f. These relationships did not differ between clinical groups. While group comparisons demonstrated greater impairment in individuals with ASD, analyzing individuals' characteristics revealed cross-diagnoses similarities in regard to their MSPSS-f relationships.

If such questions that are asked for the purpose of receiving empathy can get responses, it serves as an important factor to increase satisfaction of users.

,,,,,,,,,,Machine learning and empathy: The Civil Rights CAPTCHA,"Human interactive proofs (HIPs) are a basic security measure on the Internet to avoid automatic attacks. There is an ongoing effort to find a HIP that is secure enough yet easy for humans. Recently, a new HIP has been designed aiming at higher security: the Civil Rights Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart (CAPTCHA). It employs the empathy capacity of humans to further strengthen Securimage, a well-known text CAPTCHA. In this paper, we analyze it from a security perspective, finding fundamental design flaws. Using several well-known machine learning (ML) algorithms, we analyze to what extent these flaws affect its security. We discover that thanks to them, we can create a successful side-channel attack. This attack is able to correctly solve the HIP on 20.7% of occasions, much more than enough to consider it broken. Thus, we show that there is no need to solve the problem of optical character recognition nor empathy analysis for computers to break this particular HIP. ML can be successfully used to break a HIP that uses both with a side-channel attack. This security analysis can be applied to other HIPs. It will allow to test whether they are leaking too much information by unexpected ways, given non-evident design flaws.

,,,,,,,,,,A window into the intoxicated mind? Speech as an index of psychoactive drug effects,"Abused drugs can profoundly alter mental states in ways that may motivate drug use. These effects are usually assessed with self-report, an approach that is vulnerable to biases. Analyzing speech during intoxication may present a more direct, objective measure, offering a unique 'window' into the mind. Here, we employed computational analyses of speech semantic and topological structure after ±3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; 'ecstasy') and methamphetamine in 13 ecstasy users. In 4 sessions, participants completed a 10-min speech task after MDMA (0.75 and 1.5 mg/kg), methamphetamine (20 mg), or placebo. Latent Semantic Analyses identified the semantic proximity between speech content and concepts relevant to drug effects. Graph-based analyses identified topological speech characteristics. Group-level drug effects on semantic distances and topology were assessed. Machine-learning analyses (with leave-one-out cross-validation) assessed whether speech characteristics could predict drug condition in the individual subject. Speech after MDMA (1.5 mg/kg) had greater semantic proximity than placebo to the concepts friend, support, intimacy, and rapport. Speech on MDMA (0.75 mg/kg) had greater proximity to empathy than placebo. Conversely, speech on methamphetamine was further from compassion than placebo. Classifiers discriminated between MDMA (1.5 mg/kg) and placebo with 88% accuracy, and MDMA (1.5 mg/kg) and methamphetamine with 84% accuracy. For the two MDMA doses, the classifier performed at chance. These data suggest that automated semantic speech analyses can capture subtle alterations in mental state, accurately discriminating between drugs. The findings also illustrate the potential for automated speech-based approaches to characterize clinically relevant alterations to mental state, including those occurring in psychiatric illness. © 2014 American College of Neuropsychopharmacology.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2014,"Bedi, G.; Cecchi, G.A.; Slezak, D.F.; Carrillo, F.; Sigman, M.; De Wit, H.",Neuropsychopharmacology,,,DE3V4NUZ,10.1038/npp.2014.80,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84906320793&doi=10.1038%2fnpp.2014.80&partnerID=40&md5=7ed580cdfca01c709a69f11704fd3729,2014-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:36:25Z,2021-02-15T22:36:25Z,,2340-2348,,10,39,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 46</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,a window into the intoxicated mind? speech as an index of psychoactive drug effects,a window into the intoxicated mind speech as an index of psychoactive drug effects
,,,,,,,,,,Adaptive-BLAST: A user-defined platform for the study of proteins,"Profile-based protein-sequence analysis algorithms comprise some of the most powerful and user-friendly methods for exploring protein sequences to determine their structure, function, and/or evolution (1-4). PSI-BLAST (5, 6) and rps-BLAST (7) are two of the most popular profile-based algorithms ( 1,120 references to date), and have exceptional utility in the identification of homology between proteins, particularly for biological scientists who do not specialize in computational approaches. However, when the performance of these algorithms is compared to other methods [e.g. support-vector machine learning (SVM) (8), hidden-Markov models (HMMs) (9)], they often underperform in identifying the aforementioned protein properties (3, 9-11). We have previously demonstrated that the utility of BLAST algorithms can be significantly improved by: (i) adaptations to the profile libraries employed, (ii) adjustments to output formats, and (iii) alterations to BLAST algorithm itself (4, 6, 12-14). We present here Adaptive-BLAST (Ada-BLAST), which provides a simple user-defined platform for measuring and analyzing primary amino acid sequences. Within this platform, we developed a series of local BLAST applications (apps) that take advantage of the speed and sensitivity afforded by BLAST, while allowing for maximal user-definitions and flexible visualization. We tested the efficacy of these apps in control experiments, studying fold-recognition, in which we obtained >90% accuracy in highly divergent sequences (>25% identity). In addition, these same apps were proficient in classifying transmembrane proteins, identifying structural/functional determinants of ion-channels/receptors, and informing structural modeling algorithms. Indeed, these Ada-BLAST informed-structural models were useful in guiding our experimental research on the N-terminus of Transient Receptor Potential ion-channels (TRPs). Taken together, we propose that Ada-BLAST provides a powerful computational tool that is accessible to bench-scientists and computational biologists alike.

,,,,,,,,,,"Associations between motivational factors for studying medicine, learning approaches and empathy among medical school candidates","Previous research highlighted associations between students’ motivation for medical studies and their learning approaches on the one hand and empathy on the other. Internal motivational factors for studying medicine (e.g., care for patients, save lives) coupled with a deep approach to learning have been positively related to empathy in contrast to external motivational factors (e.g., future earning potential, prestige) and surface learning. However, assessments of these assumptions among medical school candidates are scarce. This study examined the relationship between different motivational factors and empathy among students enrolled in a selection year in medicine by testing the mediating role of learning approaches. A sample of 572 candidates for medical studies answered a self-reported questionnaire half way through their selection year. Measures included internal and external motivational factors for studying medicine, deep and surface learning approaches and empathy. Path-analysis tested the mediation effects of deep and surface approaches to learning on the relationship of internal and external motivational factors with empathy. The deep learning approach partially mediated the significant positive association between internal motivational factors and empathy, while the surface learning approach fully mediated the significant negative association between external motivational factors and empathy. These results suggest that learning approaches could be a pathway by which internal and external motives for studying medicine are related to empathy among medical school candidates. Pedagogical strategies and educational environments accounting for individual differences in motivation and learning may contribute to training students to become professional and caring doctors in the future. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2019,"Piumatti, G.; Abbiati, M.; Baroffio, A.; Gerbase, M.W.",Advances in Health Sciences Education,,,HFW6AR7X,10.1007/s10459-018-9866-6,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85056658658&doi=10.1007%2fs10459-018-9866-6&partnerID=40&md5=03617490c381649c560fcd1583bafa25,2019-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:37:00Z,2021-02-15T22:37:00Z,,287-300,,2,24,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 2</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,"associations between motivational factors for studying medicine, learning approaches and empathy among medical school candidates",associations between motivational factors for studying medicine learning approaches and empathy among medical school candidates

Michel was a year or two advanced and the first person to befriend me and ""show me the robes."" He is a unique individual with generosity of Geist or empathy, and deep analytical skills, wide interests, lucid thinking. His books and many students are evidence of this. It has been a deep joy to be his friend through the years. He has always helped me with intellectual projects and been attentive to personal issues, and all this without a touch of pedantry or arrogance. In addition to his deep learning in Religious Studies and related topics, he has a gift for empathic listening, and a singular capacity to think on his feet and lecture with amazing lucidity. © Equinox Publishing Ltd. 2019.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2019,"Griffiths, D.B.",Religious Studies and Theology,,,ZEXMTGXJ,10.1558/RSTH.38299,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85071428686&doi=10.1558%2fRSTH.38299&partnerID=40&md5=8aff8e71418d01a4196fb32b0f3976e8,2019-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:37:00Z,2021-02-15T22:37:00Z,,223-225,,1-2,38,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 0</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,when david met michel,when david met michel
,,,,,,,,,,High Sensitivity Layer Feature Analysis in Food Market,"It is not uncommon to conduct test marketing for the purpose of market research when dropping new products to the market. However, if you actually drop it you will need a lot of money. This study, we pay attention to innovation theory. In Japan, the study reported a long sales period. However, the study didn’t report a short sales period. Therefore, we report of a short sales period, especially food. This study, we call “High Sensitivity Layer” the innovators and the early adopters in innovation theory in term of to be interested in the innovation of products, sensitive to trends and constantly collecting new information by themselves and to have greater influence on other consumers. We think that those that collect a lot of empathy in the “High Sensitivity Layer” are diffusive in the innovators and the early adopters, and grab the characteristics of highly sensitive consumers who gather many empathies. I think that it may be able to fulfill the purpose of test marketing by seeing the response of new products of food to this consumer. We prepare a generalized model with a deep learning model and report features of highly sensitive consumers, visually and numerically clearly, using decision tree analysis from that model. From the analysis results, attached more images, and the older, the better it got a report that empathizes with sensitive consumers. When conducting test marketing, it is predicted that high-sensitivity consumers will be able to obtain preferable results by targeting people with this characteristic. Also, it was found that gender and emotion are not related to the characteristics of the person who writes the report sympathized with the consumer. In the future, I would like to further accurate classification by text mining of posted characters and analysis of posted images. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2019,"Matsuyama, Y.; Asahi, Y.",Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),,,EB36HPFV,10.1007/978-3-030-22649-7_19,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85069728322&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-22649-7_19&partnerID=40&md5=9cc0b47f423fdb351e845116c0d0b335,2019-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:37:00Z,2021-02-15T22:37:00Z,,232-243,,,11570 LNCS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 1</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,high sensitivity layer feature analysis in food market,high sensitivity layer feature analysis in food market
,,,,,,,,,,Poetry writing and artistic ability in problem-based learning,"Problem-based learning (PBL) is a teaching and learning approach that is widely used in healthcare education. It has similarly been suggested that poetry writing offers students a way to express their feelings and emotions related to clinical issues, medical education, and their relationship with patients. The rhythmic structure and temporal organisation of poetry allow students to remember poetry more easily than prose, suggesting that important and detailed information could be better memorised through poetic text. To report on how poetry writing and reciting was used in a PBL class in nursing to enhance the students' artistic ability, and on the students' perspectives on artistry in their learning. This paper presented a part of results of a main educational study where data were collected through lesson observations, reflective notes, and a follow-up interview. A total of 17 Hong Kong students were encouraged to collaborate in groups and write English poems based on a clinical case. A content analysis was conducted on their reflective notes and narratives were extracted from an interview. Although the students learned about cooperation, creativity, thinking, stress management, how to make lively presentations, deep learning, long-term memory, and professional knowledge, they expressed that the above were indirectly related to artistry. Scholars from the fields of both health related disciplines and literature should collaborate in researching and developing some learning and teaching activities which can further enhance the students' artistic ability so as to let them learn about empathy and understand patients' sufferings and illness experiences. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2017,"Chan, Z.C.Y.",International Journal on Disability and Human Development,,,WT2LJ33Z,10.1515/ijdhd-2016-0003,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85012279045&doi=10.1515%2fijdhd-2016-0003&partnerID=40&md5=405d95d0f3f15bf167d19c4dcd19c1cb,2017-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:37:00Z,2021-02-15T22:37:00Z,,37-44,,1,16,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 2</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,poetry writing and artistic ability in problem-based learning,poetry writing and artistic ability in problembased learning

The case of The University of Gdańsk, Poland","The Bologna process, the increasing number of higher education institutions, the mass education and the demographic problems make the quality of education and quality of the academic teachers a subject of wide public debate and concern. The aim of the paper is to identify the most preferred characteristics of a teacher working at a business school. The research problem was: What should a high-quality business school academic teacher be like? During the research, a six-stage qualitative survey design was proposed, and a letter questionnaire was applied as a free writing instrument and sent to second-year bachelor students of the Faculty of Management at The University of Gdańsk, Poland. To identify the most preferred characteristics, a content analysis and Pareto analysis were used. As a result, 32 characteristics were proposed and grouped into 5 categories, namely tangibles (T), reliability (Rel), responsiveness (Res), assurance (A) and empathy (E). Based on this, several proposals and recommendations for the future were specified.

,,,,,,,,,,Personal profile of medical students selected through a knowledge-based exam only: Are we missing suitable students?,"Introduction: A consistent body of literature highlights the importance of a broader approach to select medical school candidates both assessing cognitive capacity and individual characteristics. However, selection in a great number of medical schools worldwide is still based on knowledge exams, a procedure that might neglect students with needed personal characteristics for future medical practice. We investigated whether the personal profile of students selected through a knowledge-based exam differed from those not selected. Methods: Students applying for medical school (N=311) completed questionnaires assessing motivations for becoming a doctor, learning approaches, personality traits, empathy, and coping styles. Selection was based on the results of MCQ tests. Principal component analysis was used to draw a profile of the students. Differences between selected and non-selected students were examined by Multivariate ANOVAs, and their impact on selection by logistic regression analysis. Results: Students demonstrating a profile of diligence with higher conscientiousness, deep learning approach, and task-focused coping were more frequently selected (p=0.01). Other personal characteristics such as motivation, sociability, and empathy did not significantly differ, comparing selected and non-selected students. Conclusion: Selection through a knowledge-based exam privileged diligent students. It did neither advantage nor preclude candidates with a more humane profile. © 2016 Milena Abbiati et al.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2016,"Abbiati, M.; Baroffio, A.; Gerbase, M.W.",Medical Education Online,,,2XSLDMKQ,10.3402/meo.v21.29705,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85007079343&doi=10.3402%2fmeo.v21.29705&partnerID=40&md5=f9afdbc35a30596a7a5ca8f19aee8413,2016-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:37:01Z,2021-02-15T22:37:01Z,,,,1,21,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 9</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,personal profile of medical students selected through a knowledge-based exam only: are we missing suitable students?,personal profile of medical students selected through a knowledgebased exam only are we missing suitable students

This paper has been an elective paper within the Health Sciences for third year students at the University of Auckland for three years. The students were instructed to reflect on two assignments after they had written each one. The first assignment focused on addiction models and the second assignment focused on social marketing as a public health approach to potentially addictive behaviour (e.g. substance abuse, gambling, and eating disorders). The findings from the first assignment suggested that students developed (or enhanced) empathy towards sufferers of addiction. The findings from both of the assignments revealed that many of the students were developing reflective skills, though often this was at quite a basic level. These findings suggested that more guidance and feedback is needed to aid students in the reflective journey. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2012,"Shepherd, R.-M.; Pinder, J.",Reflective Practice,,,BGVZ3GJD,10.1080/14623943.2012.659098,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84863634090&doi=10.1080%2f14623943.2012.659098&partnerID=40&md5=015be0861ef77435a99d1fa7016ceb34,2012-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:37:01Z,2021-02-15T22:37:01Z,,541-550,,4,13,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 1</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,reflective practice in addiction studies: promoting deeper learning and de-stigmatising myths about addictions,reflective practice in addiction studies promoting deeper learning and destigmatising myths about addictions

Nowadays, technological breakthroughs might have a significant impact on our moral character and abilities. This is the case of Virtual Reality (VR) technologies. The aim of this paper is to consider the ethical aspects of the use of VR in enhancing empathy. First, we will offer an introduction to VR, explaining its fundamental features, devices and concepts. Then, we will approach the characterization of VR as an “empathy machine,” showing why this medium has aroused so much interest and why, nevertheless, we do not believe it is the ideal way to enhance empathy. As an alternative, we will consider fostering empathy-related abilities through virtual embodiment in avatars. In the conclusion, however, we will examine some of the serious concerns related to the ethical relevance of empathy and will defend the philosophical case for a reason-guided empathy, also suggesting specific guidelines for possible future developments of empathy enhancement projects through VR embodied experiences. © Copyright © 2020 Rueda and Lara.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2020,"Rueda, J.; Lara, F.",Frontiers in Robotics and AI,,,WEDKTWNF,10.3389/frobt.2020.506984,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096676765&doi=10.3389%2ffrobt.2020.506984&partnerID=40&md5=4b19807309d5e5fc09617f353c543157,2020-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:37:38Z,2021-02-15T22:37:38Z,,,,,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 0</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,virtual reality and empathy enhancement: ethical aspects,virtual reality and empathy enhancement ethical aspects
,,,,,,,,,,Simulating Peace Operations: New Digital Possibilities for Training and Public Education,"Background and Motivation.: A plethora of warfighting games exist commercially, but there is a lack of digital games that deal with peace processes. Furthermore, none simulate actual peacekeeping. The United Nations currently deploys about 100,000 peacekeepers to some of the world’s most dangerous zones, where peacekeepers save lives, alleviate suffering, and help create conditions for peace. The United Nations and national militaries lack peacekeeping simulations to help train their soldiers. Additionally, the public needs to learn more about the way peacekeeping works. Thus, peacekeeping simulation and gaming are worth exploring, especially in the rapidly evolving digital space, which offers new avenues and benefits. Methods.: We review the meager literature on the subject and observe that there are few digital games to directly draw from. We build on previous work that argued the need for such development, but we now assess important design principles and parameters. We draw upon peacekeeping tabletop exercises that are already well developed. Results.: We conclude that excellent scenarios and simulation technologies exist that could be combined quite easily for effective peacekeeping training and public education. We find key materials and scenarios in exercises of the United Nations and of the Pearson Peacekeeping Centre. Highlighted areas for future digital design are the inclusion of non-military avatars, emphasis on soft skills development (especially empathy), and realistically complex links between actions and consequences. Conclusion.: While describing some UN exploration at a proof-of-concept stage, we suggest that both the United Nations and the gaming industry should explore the idea further to achieve synergies between institutional and entertainment applications. The growing capacity of digital technology allows significant innovation, yielding results that could be useful, ethical, enjoyable, and potentially profitable. © 2020 SAGE Publications.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2020,"Dorn, A.W.; Dawson, P.F.",Simulation and Gaming,,,XQDPCCJQ,10.1177/1046878120968605,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85095452183&doi=10.1177%2f1046878120968605&partnerID=40&md5=fa1122832b21ccc429123ceace2be44d,2020-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:37:38Z,2021-02-15T22:37:38Z,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 0</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,simulating peace operations: new digital possibilities for training and public education,simulating peace operations new digital possibilities for training and public education
,,,,,,,,,,Decreasing Racial Bias Through A Facilitated Game and Workshop: The Case of Fair Play,"Introduction. Fair Play is an avatar-based role-playing video game in which Jamal Davis, a Black graduate student at a research university, navigates implicit forms of racial bias to reach the win-state of earning his PhD and becoming a professor. Fair Play was designed to educate players on the existence of racial bias in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine (STEMM) fields in an experiential way and to encourage perspective-taking. Research has found that taking the perspective of another can induce empathy, which improves the empathizer’s attitudes towards individuals and groups. Paired with a facilitated workshop, Fair Play was also designed to teach bias concepts to increase participants’ bias literacy. Intervention. Research on workshops to reduce gender bias suggests that it increased awareness of personal bias, the motivation and self-efficacy to practice bias-reducing strategies, and a more welcoming department climate and the hiring of more women faculty three years after the intervention. Capitalizing on these findings, a 3-hour workshop was developed to reduce race-based bias against Black/African Americans in STEMM using Fair Play. Conclusions. The facilitation of the workshops and Fair Play requires particular competencies due to its topic (racial bias) and player’s skepticism about the reality of the bias incidents. Our data suggest that participants who identify as a person of color are more likely to believe that bias exists compared to White players, which can lead to a discussion about how the incidents in the game were designed and scripted. The facilitator also needs to be versed in a number of intentional design choices, such as Jamal not having voiceover and his success. Finally, this paper describes the Facilitator Game, which was developed as a complement to the game and allows a facilitator to jump to bias incidents quickly while debriefing and discussing the game to further participant learning. © 2020 SAGE Publications.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2020,"Pribbenow, C.M.; Caldwell, K.E.H.; Dantzler, D.D.; Brown, Jr., P.; Carnes, M.",Simulation and Gaming,,,FU6GEA5V,10.1177/1046878120983384,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85098243099&doi=10.1177%2f1046878120983384&partnerID=40&md5=d34a04335f4fc627541d343be8135d8e,2020-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:37:38Z,2021-02-15T22:37:38Z,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 0</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,decreasing racial bias through a facilitated game and workshop: the case of fair play,decreasing racial bias through a facilitated game and workshop the case of fair play
,,,,,,,,,,Empathy at play: Embodying posthuman subjectivities in gaming,"In this article, we address the need for a posthuman account of the relationship between the avatar and player. We draw on a particular line of posthumanist theory associated closely with the work of Karen Barad, Rosi Braidotti and N. Katherine Hayles that suggests a constantly permeable, fluid and extended subjectivity, displacing the boundaries between human and other. In doing so, we propose a posthuman concept of empathy in gameplay, and we apply this concept to data from the first author’s 18-month ethnographic field notes of gameplay in the MMORPG World of Warcraft. Exploring these data through our analysis of posthuman empathy, we demonstrate the entanglement of avatar–player, machine–human relationship. We show how empathy allows us to understand this relationship as constantly negotiated and in process, producing visceral reactions in the intra-connected avatar–player subject as well as moments of co-produced in-game action that require ‘affective matching’ between subjective and embodied experiences. We argue that this account of the avatar–player relationship extends research in game culture, providing a horizontal, non-hierarchical discussion of its most necessary interaction. © The Author(s) 2017.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2019,"Wilde, P.; Evans, A.",Convergence,,,NM2S3UX5,10.1177/1354856517709987,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85070362093&doi=10.1177%2f1354856517709987&partnerID=40&md5=aab7a0ce8378b091e336a622000c3483,2019-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:37:38Z,2021-02-15T22:37:38Z,,791-806,,5-6,25,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 1</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,empathy at play: embodying posthuman subjectivities in gaming,empathy at play embodying posthuman subjectivities in gaming

I study the avatar as textually signifying, as an observed body, and as a prosthetic tool-limb using the works of Merleau-Ponty and Heidegger as theoretical support and Ian Bogost’s procedural style of videogame reading. I perform close readings of videogame-texts Metal Gear Solid 3 and Mirror’s Edge demonstrating how the former enacts a traditional kinaesthetic empathy in the same way as in dance or film and the latter complicates this observer/performer relation. My paper concludes that, though a player/reader may experience a kinaesthetic empathy that resembles the filmic mode of observer/performer kinaesthetic empathy, the videogame form engenders a deeper tool-based empathy, which is altogether different from traditional conceptions of kinaesthetic empathy. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2017,"Chin, G.P.W.-H.",Digital Creativity,,,DVVA9FVF,10.1080/14626268.2017.1348363,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85025148899&doi=10.1080%2f14626268.2017.1348363&partnerID=40&md5=c7661dcdf2925cb93633714b0755ded6,2017-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:37:40Z,2021-02-15T22:37:40Z,,206-223,,3,28,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 1</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,observed bodies and tool selves: kinaesthetic empathy and the videogame avatar,observed bodies and tool selves kinaesthetic empathy and the videogame avatar

,,,,,,,,,,The Ethics of Mislocalized Selfhood: Proprioceptive drifting towards the virtual other,"In Psychology, ‘proprioceptive drift’ is a term that originates from the rubber hand illusion paradigm to describe the ‘relative displacement of the perceived location of one’s own hand toward the location of the rubber hand’ (Wold et al, 2014). Correspondingly, drift measurements in science are used as a means of rating the intensity of a body-ownership illusion via which a participant in a controlled experiment perceives that an extracorporeal appendage, or virtual whole-body avatar is incorporated as part of one’s own body schema. In this research article, I will examine an applied performance by BeAnotherLab utilising the anti-disciplinary collective’s The Machine to Be Another as part of Good Chance’s Encampment project–this telepresence system produces a VR body illusion intended to increase empathy and reduce proximity between an immersant’s real body and that of a volunteer refugee counterpart. When scientifically-tested body illusions cross a paradigmatic boundary to be framed as immersive art, what are the ethical implications? Furthermore, are these kinds of virtual proprioceptive transactions across different kinds of social and political boundaries symptomatic of radical empathic acts, or a capitalistic desire for the acquisition of another’s experiences by virtual means? This article examines illusory bodily inhabitation through a Levinasian critical lens to consider the ethics of deterritorializing the immersant’s gaze and referring their sense of touch elsewhere to produce ‘narrative immersion’. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2017,"Jarvis, L.",Performance Research,,,7SYH2Q34,10.1080/13528165.2017.1348587,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85029772572&doi=10.1080%2f13528165.2017.1348587&partnerID=40&md5=c0fc49b30428a3e8f4e132804abaebbd,2017-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:37:40Z,2021-02-15T22:37:40Z,,30-37,,3,22,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 1</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,the ethics of mislocalized selfhood: proprioceptive drifting towards the virtual other,the ethics of mislocalized selfhood proprioceptive drifting towards the virtual other
,,,,,,,,,,Analyzing and Predicting Empathy in Neurotypical and Nonneurotypical Users with an Affective Avatar,"In recent times, diagnosing and treating different health issues have improved greatly with the help of technology, with an example being cognitive health issues. Despite this, there is still a difference between how the technology is working towards it and the actual potential that can be achieved. In this paper, we propose a mobile application with an affective avatar, encompassed in the area of serious games, which will obtain information related to the interactions performed by the users. There are a total of 50 users, of neurotypical and nonneurotypical backgrounds, with the latter being people with Down syndrome and intellectual disability. Based on collected data from the different users interacting with the avatar in a mobile device, we analyzed the results to obtain a ground truth about prototypic empathic interactions and feed those interactions to a learning algorithm to support the diagnosis process and therapy treatment of empathy and socialization issues. © 2017 Esperanza Johnson et al.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2017,"Johnson, E.; Hervás, R.; Gutiérrez-López-Franca, C.; Mondéjar, T.; Bravo, J.",Mobile Information Systems,,,NGCP8FME,10.1155/2017/7932529,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85021665183&doi=10.1155%2f2017%2f7932529&partnerID=40&md5=56f1d3d19d1da916c8444885ffcfd4a1,2017-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:37:40Z,2021-02-15T22:37:40Z,,,,,2017,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 2</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,analyzing and predicting empathy in neurotypical and nonneurotypical users with an affective avatar,analyzing and predicting empathy in neurotypical and nonneurotypical users with an affective avatar
,,,,,,,,,,"Auto-empathy or the others-in-oneself's evolution: Definition and clinic of virtual [L'auto-empathie, ou le devenir de l'autrui-en-soi: Définition et clinique du virtuel]","Objectives: The authors propose to explore a psychic phenomenon, the ""auto-empathy"", as implemented in the context of digital spaces and particularly in the situation of the player who embodies an avatar (a pixel figure) in a video game. Method: From the perspective of a theoretical opening both phenomenological and psychoanalytic, auto-empathy is the process in which, taking the position of the ""other-in-oneself"", we represent our subjective world - or the all states of our subjectivity (actions, emotions, thoughts) - by an empathic relationship with ourselves. The auto-empathy relationship is a process of distancing, and symbolic appropriation, in which we are divided into halves, implementing our innate ability to be both subject and object for ourselves. Results: The mediatization of auto-empathy in digital worlds can put ourselves instead of a figure that represents us - our avatar - so that our empathy is turned towards ourselves indirectly. This second time of empathy for a virtual figure of the self, called ""mediatized auto-empathy"" or ""virtual auto-empathy"", would contribute thirdly to the development of empathy for oneself. Finally, the development of empathy for others would be supported in a fourth time, by the attention the players are paying to each other in network games. Discussion: These four hypotheses, illustrated by clinical cases, open an interrogation concerning the frame of the psychoanalytical work. In the adolescent, the work of virtualisation, which consists in the creative anticipation of its subjective possibilities, seems regularly impeded. The mental duplicity is no longer in a position to operate a symbolizing distance between the real self and the virtual self, between the subjective self and the subjectivising self. The other-in-oneself is ineffective in proposing to the adolescent an empathic dialogue with oneself. Consequently, the autorepresentation flirts with the seizure, in particular in the subjective states of breaks. Nevertheless, the digital spaces could be indirect media of appropriation of subjective experiences for the teenager. Conclusion: Our reflections led us to think of auto-empathy as the realization of the other-in-oneself which allows us to represent our own subjective world. The auto-empathy mediatized by an avatar can thus be described as a representation by empathy of our subjective part that contains this character. From then on, the space of the video game appears as a space of subjectivation. © 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2016,"Tordo, F.; Binkley, C.",Evolution Psychiatrique,,,3BLFMG24,10.1016/j.evopsy.2014.02.002,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84900883323&doi=10.1016%2fj.evopsy.2014.02.002&partnerID=40&md5=2772d143d98da8ff9a47bdfb519c12da,2016-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:37:41Z,2021-02-15T22:37:41Z,,293-308,,2,81,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 6</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,"auto-empathy or the others-in-oneself's evolution: definition and clinic of virtual [l'auto-empathie, ou le devenir de l'autrui-en-soi: définition et clinique du virtuel]",autoempathy or the othersinoneselfs evolution definition and clinic of virtual lautoempathie ou le devenir de lautruiensoi définition et clinique du virtuel
,,,,,,,,,,Dynamic facial emotion recognition oriented to HCI applications,"As part of a multimodal animated avatar previously presented in Marcos-Pablos et al. ((2010) A realistic, virtual head for human-computer interaction. Interact. Comput., 22, 176-192, ISSN 0953-5438), in this paper we describe a method for dynamic recognition of displayed facial emotions on low-resolution streaming images. First, we address the detection of action units (AUs) of the facial action coding system using active shape models and Gabor filters. Normalized outputs of the AU recognition step are then used as inputs for a neural network that consists of an habituation network plus a competitive network. Both the competitive and the habituation layer use differential equations, thus taking into account the dynamic information of facial expressions through time. Experimental results carried out on live video sequences and on the Cohn-Kanade face database show that the proposed method provides high recognition hit rates. To assess the suitability of the developed emotional recognition system for human-computer interaction applications, it has been successfully integrated in the architecture of an avatar and we have conducted a preliminary experiment on empathy. The experiment showed promising results, as the avatar that made use of the emotional recognition system obtained a clear increase in the positivity of the rating when compared with the same avatar with no emotional response. © 2013 The Author.

,,,,,,,,,,Sending an avatar to do a human’s job: Compliance with authority persists despite the uncanny valley,"Just as physical appearance affects social influence in human communication, it may also affect the processing of advice conveyed through avatars, computer-animated characters, and other human-like interfaces. Although the most persuasive computer interfaces are often the most human-like, they have been predicted to incur the greatest risk of falling into the uncanny valley, the loss of empathy attributed to characters that appear eerily human. Previous studies compared interfaces on the left side of the uncanny valley, namely, those with low human likeness. To examine interfaces with higher human realism, a between-groups factorial experiment was conducted through the internet with 426 midwestern U.S. undergraduates. This experiment presented a hypothetical ethical dilemma followed by the advice of an authority figure. The authority was manipulated in three ways: depiction (digitally recorded or computer animated), motion quality (smooth or jerky), and advice (disclose or refrain from disclosing sensitive information). Of these, only the advice changed opinion about the ethical dilemma, even though the animated depiction was significantly eerier than the human depiction. These results indicate that compliance with an authority persists even when using an uncannily realistic computeranimated double. © 2015 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2015,"Patel, H.; MacDorman, K.F.",Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments,,,BBBHY7BP,10.1162/PRES_a_00212,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84929302303&doi=10.1162%2fPRES_a_00212&partnerID=40&md5=19d56358034d04dcd1491d273a47bb96,2015-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:37:42Z,2021-02-15T22:37:42Z,,1-23,,1,24,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 7</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,sending an avatar to do a human’s job: compliance with authority persists despite the uncanny valley,sending an avatar to do a humans job compliance with authority persists despite the uncanny valley
,,,,,,,,,,Satyamev Jayate: Return of the star as a sacrificial figure,"This paper attempts to make sense of Satyamev Jayate, a popular Indian television show hosted by film star Aamir Khan, in terms of its politics, Khan's stardom and the attempt to reframe the social on television. Grappling with the broad contours of the cultural economy of justice on national television in India, I suggest that the star descends upon television as an avatar promising empathy to a variety of victims of social injustice. In so doing, Khan converts crime news into emotional truths. The show has not only generated public debate, it also invites the public to return to a performative innocence. As television becomes the site of articulating moral authority, ritual participation and demanding social change, the political is re-assembled through Khan's stardom. The paper also enquires how and why the show compels narrative ingenuity towards what Aditya Nigam calls the implosion of the political-the erasure of the public from the street and its re-inscription in the studio. Equally notable here is the role film-stardom plays in rendering moral authority through the trope of the sacrificial. © 2014 South Asian Studies Association of Australia.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2014,"Kumar, A.",South Asia: Journal of South Asia Studies,,,TCR63WRQ,10.1080/00856401.2014.906087,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84903305515&doi=10.1080%2f00856401.2014.906087&partnerID=40&md5=8eeb748d4113326360347c7abe847f12,2014-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:37:42Z,2021-02-15T22:37:42Z,,239-254,,2,37,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 5</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,satyamev jayate: return of the star as a sacrificial figure,satyamev jayate return of the star as a sacrificial figure
,,,,,,,,,,The effects of avatar: Based customization on player identification,"Games allow players to perceive themselves in alternate ways in imagined worlds. Player identification is one of the outcomes of gameplay experiences in these worlds and has been shown to affect enjoyment and reduce self-discrepancy. Avatar-based customization has potential to impact player identification by shaping the relationship between the player and the character. This mixed method study aims to fill the gap in the identification literature by examining the effects of avatar-based customization on players' identification with and empathy towards their characters in a massively multiplayer online game, Lord of the Rings Online (LotRO). Participants (N = 66) played LotRO either in customization or in no-customization groups for about ten hours in four sessions over two weeks in a controlled lab setting. Data were collected through interviews, surveys and observations. Results showed both time and avatar-based customization positively impacted players' identification with their avatars. Self-Determination Theory is used to interpret results.

,,,,,,,,,,Effectiveness of a poverty simulation in second life®: Changing nursing student attitudes toward poor people,"Social justice is a fundamental value of the nursing profession, challenging educators to instill this professional value when caring for the poor. This randomized controlled trial examined whether an interactive virtual poverty simulation created in Second Life® would improve nursing students' empathy with and attributions for people living in poverty, compared to a self-study module. We created a multi-user virtual environment populated with families and individual avatars that represented the demographics contributing to poverty and vulnerability. Participants (N = 51 baccalaureate nursing students) were randomly assigned to either Intervention or Control groups and completed the modified Attitudes toward Poverty Scale pre- and post-intervention. The 2.5-hour simulation was delivered three times over a 1-year period to students in successive community health nursing classes. The investigators conducted post-simulation debriefings following a script. While participants in the virtual poverty simulation developed significantly more favorable attitudes on five questions than the Control group, the total scores did not differ significantly. Whereas students readily learned how to navigate inside Second Life®, faculty facilitators required periodic coaching and guidance to be competent. While poverty simulations, whether virtual or face-to-face, have some ability to transform nursing student attitudes, faculty must incorporate social justice concepts throughout the curriculum to produce lasting change. © 2014, Walter de Gruyter GmbH.

The dance was modelled on the format of popular Wii dance games, and coordinated black and white dancers, families, mass publics and prerecorded and live footage in order to choreograph European 'unity in diversity'. The use of black dancers as avatars urging dancing crowds towards greater kinaesthetic sensitivity raises the questions of how race is figured in neo-liberal visions of cosmopolitan Europe, and what role gaming technology plays in facilitating cross-racial empathy and ethical responsiveness at a time when solidarity is fraying as a consequence of fiscal crises and austerity measures. Finally, the article considers Afro-European academic, activist and artistic practices as alternatives to neo-liberal regimes of race. © 2013 International Federation for Theatre Research.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2013,"Sieg, K.",Theatre Research International,,,8C99KSHR,10.1017/S030788331200096X,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84878179286&doi=10.1017%2fS030788331200096X&partnerID=40&md5=2eb54b155cd8b567b6d69b17270600be,2013-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:37:42Z,2021-02-15T22:37:42Z,,20-33,,1,38,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 3</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,wii are family: performing race in neo-liberal europe,wii are family performing race in neoliberal europe

This action-motricity, which simulates the system of representation of action, is engaged in a process of virtual auto-empathy through corporal sensations felt by the player. A real intersubjective traffic between the characters-players is added, in the persistent worlds, where the virtual other is an already-existing.

,,,,,,,,,,The Application of Mobile Learning for University Students in the Pancasila Education Modul in Developing Character of Students' Empathy,"The main purpose of this study is to improve students’ empathy attitudes in Pancasila education courses using applications in mobile phones. It is a tool application or media that is used by educators to be able to transfer knowledge to their students. This is used to be able to increase the interaction and learning motivation of students, so they can obtain maximum learning resources. The name of the application is Pancasila Mobile learning, and it is available on Playstore for Android users and web-based page. Meanwhile, the empathy characters need to be developed by the school to be able to grow in students. As such, this study focuses on growing empathy by using mobile learning applications. The research method used is quantitative. The data collection technique used was an online questionnaire, which was filled by 119 students at universities in Jakarta. They are students who have already or are studying Pancasila in college. The results of this study indicate that the use of mobile learning applications in learning Pancasila in the classroom can increase empathy attitudes towards students. They can carry out positive activities, and feel pleasure and comfort when using mobile learning applications in the learning process. Thus, the use of mobile learning needs to be continuously developed by educators both in universities and schools.

The story-making process in the proposed prototype design is based on Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, and consists of five types of story cards(characters, setting, objects/actions, goals, and emotions) as its story elements. We have developed and tested a prototype game using Unity3D game engine on an Android platform with two play modes - single-player and multi-player. In the multi-player mode, three players can play together: each player is assigned the role of an initiator, a conflictor and a mediator in wireless network environments. Our ultimate goal is to encourage players to empathize with other players by letting them create and resolve (or mediate) emotional conflicts through the process of perspective-taking in a collaborative storytelling game. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2020,"Bae, B.-C.; Kim, H.-J.",Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),,,4EMJDEU3,10.1007/978-3-030-50164-8_27,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088745007&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-50164-8_27&partnerID=40&md5=fcbbebb6f3c1f3a09c94bdbf6d0e5ece,2020-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:37:59Z,2021-02-15T22:37:59Z,,375-384,,,12211 LNCS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 0</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,a cooperative storytelling card game for conflict resolution and empathy,a cooperative storytelling card game for conflict resolution and empathy
,,,,,,,,,,Can Androids Write Science Fiction? Ian McEwan’s Machines like Me,"McEwan’s novel Machines Like Me was met with lukewarm reviews and open hostility of the sci-fi genre adherents. It seemed to have appropriated some of the key issues of the genre discourse–the question of what constitutes humanity, of the possibility of coexistence between humans and AI, of the problems of morality and consent. It also made use of time-honored devices of alternative history without treating it too seriously. Instead, the characters are enmeshed in personal problems and conundrums of science and politics, justice and empathy–and love. McEwan’s commentary on the novel in various interviews only aggravated the critics who were all too ready to conclude that Machines Like Me offered little originality. This essay will demonstrate that the text is carefully layered as if to protect its own novelty hidden beneath rather conventional love triangle plot, ponderous political commentary, and genre-specific topicality. It will be an effort to understand the complex relation between the writer and conventions which come into play in his novel, and it will proceed to read the text against the authorial comments, finding suppressed hints that invite an interpretation of the text as narrated by its android hero rather than human subject. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2020,"Księżopolska, I.",Critique - Studies in Contemporary Fiction,,,7QVM78JY,10.1080/00111619.2020.1851165,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096586219&doi=10.1080%2f00111619.2020.1851165&partnerID=40&md5=f654e96e86eeb1f62ef29028328451ef,2020-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:37:59Z,2021-02-15T22:37:59Z,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 0</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,can androids write science fiction? ian mcewan’s machines like me,can androids write science fiction ian mcewans machines like me

This study aimed to find out the quality of PSC 119 Si Slamet as a prehospital emergency service innovation. The data collection in this study was carried out in a location, namely, Batang Regency, Indonesia, in May-June 2018. The qualitative data collection methods used in this study are in-depth interviews and document reviews. This study was using Service Quality (Servqual) questionnaire. The results show that PSC 119 Si Slamet provides easy access to emergency services to the community 24 hours a day and 7 days a week by simply calling 119 numbers, sending messages via SMS and WhatsApp, or using the Android-based application, with a maximum response time target of 10 minutes. Batang is one of the regencies (rural area) in Central Java province, located on the main coastline, with a hilly geographic condition with many derivatives, climbs, and sharp curves, which is one of the causes of the high number of traffic accidents in the area. This emergency care information systems, with Android-based application, was aimed at improving the quality of services in the health sector, especially emergency services. This service is of good quality as seen from the tangible, reliability, responsiveness, assurance, and empathy dimensions. However, in the implementation, the socialization aspect is not the best to some people. The recommendation given was the need to increase the PSC 119 socialization of Si Slamet not only regionally but also internationally to be massive, especially in developing countries. © 2020 Kassel University Press GmbH.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2020,"Sulistiadi, W.; Nurhidayah, S.; Asyary, Al",International journal of online and biomedical engineering,,,T3SVBIB7,10.3991/ijoe.v16i07.14725,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089019653&doi=10.3991%2fijoe.v16i07.14725&partnerID=40&md5=30a783d732c6318be26f5be2d426c911,2020-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:37:59Z,2021-02-15T22:37:59Z,,75-85,,7,16,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 0</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,"evaluating the management information system of integrated medical emergency care in batang regency, indonesia",evaluating the management information system of integrated medical emergency care in batang regency indonesia
,,,,,,,,,,Emotions and Media Multitasking Behaviour among Indian College Students,"Media multitasking, a simultaneous consumption of two or more media, is a ubiquitous and popular behaviour among the youth. One of the reasons for its increasing growth is the structural/market-level factors (known as media factors). Although India is a growing technology hub, there have been limited efforts to identify the media multitasking behaviour among the youth in this country. Thus, this study attempts to analyse the prevalence of media multitasking behaviour among the Indian college students and its relationship with their emotions through two methods: self-report and an android-based application known as ‘Affective Media Landscape Survey’ (AMLS). Previous studies have reported that continuous interaction with media diminishes face-to-face interaction, reduces empathy and increases the tendency to live in the virtual world. This raises the concern for emotional differences in everyday life, if any, between the high and low groups of media multitaskers. So the second objective of the study is to understand the emotional profile of the users that varies among media multitasking index. To achieve these objectives, the same two methods, the ‘self-report’ that involves questionnaires and AMLS (an android-based app to study the frequency of media multitasking behaviour and the emotions of the users) have been employed. The study gives an insight into the emerging behavioural patterns and hence is helpful for designing communities to cater to the growing needs of the young media users. © 2018 Mudra Institute of Communications, Ahmedabad, India.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2018,"Shukla, S.; Sharma, P.",Journal of Creative Communications,,,HZDA87VN,10.1177/0973258618790794,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85053427916&doi=10.1177%2f0973258618790794&partnerID=40&md5=aa44bb6595f8efc8632f378247c70b8e,2018-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:37:59Z,2021-02-15T22:37:59Z,,197-211,,3,13,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 2</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,emotions and media multitasking behaviour among indian college students,emotions and media multitasking behaviour among indian college students
,,,,,,,,,,More human than human,"Within the literature surrounding nonhuman animals on the one hand and cognitively disabled humans on the other, there is much discussion of where beings that do not satisfy the criteria for personhood fit in our moral deliberations. In the future, we may face a different but related problem: That we might create (or cause the creation of) beings that not only satisfy but exceed these criteria. The question becomes whether these are minimal criteria, or hierarchical, such that those who fulfill them to greater degree should be afforded greater consideration. This article questions the validity and necessity of drawing divisions among beings that satisfy the minimum requirements for personhood; considering how future beings - intelligent androids, synthezoids, even alternate-substrate sentiences - might fit alongside the baseline human. I ask whether these alternate beings ought to be considered different to us, and why this may or may not matter in terms of a notion of human community. The film Blade Runner, concerned in large part with humanity and its key synthezoid antagonist Roy Batty, forms a framing touchstone for my discussion. Batty is stronger, faster, more resilient, and more intelligent than Homo sapiens. His exploits, far beyond the capability of normal humans, are contrasted with his frailty and transient lifespan, his aesthetic appreciation of the sights he has seen, and his burgeoning empathy. Not for nothing does his creator within the mythos term him more human than human. © Cambridge University Press 2017.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2017,"Lawrence, D.",Cambridge Quarterly of Healthcare Ethics,,,QPU9QRNQ,10.1017/S0963180116001158,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85019997561&doi=10.1017%2fS0963180116001158&partnerID=40&md5=e3142c138b00fcf2ae2397005a02231c,2017-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:37:59Z,2021-02-15T22:37:59Z,,476-490,,3,26,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 5</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,more human than human,more human than human
,,,,,,,,,,Do conservators dream of electric sheep? Replicas and replication,"The paper crosses the boundaries between different genres, drawing on key material and emphasising the philosophical challenges around decision-making and values in relation to replication and replicas. In 1968, Philip K. Dick wrote the book Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? which became the inspiration for the 1982 film Bladerunner. The book is set in Los Angeles in a post-apocalyptic future where mankind has left Earth, resulting in androids being created to develop new ‘off-world’ colonies. The book and film create a novel and interesting framework to discuss the subject of replicas and replication within contemporary conservation practice. Key themes are decay promoting replication, original versus replica, creating empathy in replication. The debate focuses on the case study of Naum Gabo's Construction in Space (Crystal) of 1937–39; which was the sculpture replicated in the most recent replication project at Tate, completed in July 2015. © 2016, © The International Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works 2016.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2016,"Lawson, L.; Cane, S.",Studies in Conservation,,,6BZXGJ3J,10.1080/00393630.2016.1181348,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84988329847&doi=10.1080%2f00393630.2016.1181348&partnerID=40&md5=10144d954aca38ab318f4ec5ae973e82,2016-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:38:00Z,2021-02-15T22:38:00Z,,109-113,,,61,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>cited By 2</p>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,do conservators dream of electric sheep? replicas and replication,do conservators dream of electric sheep replicas and replication

On the basis of evolution theory, we investigate the implicit psychological mechanisms that underlie consumers' interactions with medical AI and a human doctor. In a behavioral investigation (Study 1), consumers expressed a positive intention to use medical AI's healthcare services when it used personalized rather than mechanical conversation. However, neural investigation (Study 2) using functional magnetic resonance imaging revealed that some consumers' implicit attitudes toward medical AI differed from their expressed behavioral intentions. The brain areas linked with implicitly apathetic emotions were activated even when medical AI used a personalized conversation, whereas consumers' brains were activated in areas associated with prosociality when they interacted with a human doctor who used a personalized conversation. On the basis of our neural evidence, consumers perceive an identical personalized conversation differently when it is offered by a medical AI versus a human doctor. These findings have implications for the area of human-AI interactions and medical decision-making and suggest that replacing human doctors with medical AI is still an unrealistic proposition.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,,"Yun, Jin Ho; Lee, Eun-Ju; Kim, Dong Hyun",Psychology & Marketing,,0742-6046,IWREVEGH,10.1002/mar.21445,,2010-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-11T01:55:23Z,2021-02-11T01:55:23Z,,,,,,,Psychol.

,,,,,,,,,,"Technology Can Augment, but Not Replace, Critical Human Skills Needed for Patient Care","The practice of medicine is changing rapidly as a consequence of electronic health record adoption, new technologies for patient care, disruptive innovations that breakdown professional hierarchies, and evolving societal norms. Collectively, these have resulted in the modification of the physician's role as the gatekeeper for health care, increased shift-based care, and amplified interprofessional team-based care. Technological innovations present opportunities as well as challenges. Artificial intelligence, which has great potential, has already transformed some tasks, particularly those involving image interpretation. Ubiquitous access to information via the Internet by physicians and patients alike presents benefits as well as drawbacks: patients and providers have ready access to virtually all of human knowledge, but some websites are contaminated with misinformation and many people have difficulty differentiating between solid, evidence-based data and untruths. The role of the future physician will shift as complexity in health care increases and as artificial intelligence and other technologies advance. These technological advances demand new skills of physicians; memory and knowledge accumulation will diminish in importance while information management skills will become more important. In parallel, medical educators must enhance their teaching and assessment of critical human skills (e.g., clear communication, empathy) in the delivery of patient care. The authors emphasize the enduring role of critical human skills in safe and effective patient care even as medical practice is increasingly guided by artificial intelligence and related technology, and they suggest new and longitudinal ways of assessing essential noncognitive skills to meet the demands of the future.

This paper presents the experience of one aspect of artificial intelligence, machine learning, coupled with patient empathy to improve utilization of assisted reproductive technology (ART), which is an important aspect of care that is under-recognized. Although ART provides very effective options for infertile patients to build families, patients often discontinue ART when further treatment is likely to be beneficial and most of these patients do not achieve pregnancy without medical aid. Use of ART is only in part dependent on financial considerations; stress and other factors play a major role, as shown by high discontinuation rates despite reimbursement.

,,,,,,,,,,A Generalized Framework for Moral Dilemmas Involving Autonomous Vehicles: A Commentary on Gill,"By using scenarios based on moral dilemmas, Gill (2020) found that when consumers are riding in an autonomous vehicle (AV), they are more willing to harm a pedestrian than when they, themselves, are driving a regular car. By taking a first-person perspective, in contrast to most prior research that has taken a third-person perspective, the problem is framed in a personal way that allows identification of a mechanism of responsibility attribution. In this commentary, a generalized framework is developed in which we can locate the work of Gill (2020), as well as prior research that uses moral dilemmas, to understand how consumers believe that AVs should respond when faced with competing life-and-death alternatives. The framework shows the distinct positions that research to date has adopted, points out gaps in research, and suggests a family of four research agendas that can be pursued going forward, driven in large part by the perspective taken to the moral dilemma. Research employing these different perspectives, including the unresearched problem of taking the perspective of the object, holds promise for using moral dilemmas for enabling our understanding of consumer experience and consumer-object relationships with AVs.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2020,"Novak, Thomas P.",Journal of Consumer Research,,0093-5301,6U4AU3AH,10.1093/jcr/ucaa024,,2020-08-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-11T01:55:23Z,2021-02-11T01:55:23Z,,292-300,,2,47,,J.

,,,,,,,,,,Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing in Psychotherapy Research: Alliance as Example Use Case,"Artificial intelligence generally and machine learning specifically have become deeply woven into the lives and technologies of modern life. Machine learning is dramatically changing scientific research and industry and may also hold promise for addressing limitations encountered in mental health care and psychotherapy. The current paper introduces machine learning and natural language processing as related methodologies that may prove valuable for automating the assessment of meaningful aspects of treatment. Prediction of therapeutic alliance from session recordings is used as a case in point. Recordings from 1,235 sessions of 386 clients seen by 40 therapists at a university counseling center were processed using automatic speech recognition software. Machine learning algorithms learned associations between client ratings of therapeutic alliance exclusively from session linguistic content. Using a portion of the data to train the model, machine learning algorithms modestly predicted alliance ratings from session content in an independent test set (Spearman's rho =15, p <.001). These results highlight the potential to harness natural language processing and machine learning to predict a key psychotherapy process variable that is relatively distal from linguistic content. Six practical suggestions for conducting psychotherapy research using machine learning are presented along with several directions for future research. Questions of dissemination and implementation may be particularly important to explore as machine learning improves in its ability to automate assessment of psychotherapy process and outcome.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2020,"Goldberg, Simon B.; Flemotomos, Nikolaos; Martinez, Victor R.; Tanana, Michael J.; Kuo, Patty B.; Pace, Brian T.; Villatte, Jennifer L.; Georgiou, Panayiotis G.; Van Epps, Jake; Imel, Zac E.; Narayanan, Shrikanth S.; Atkins, David C.",Journal of Counseling Psychology,,0022-0167,B7K9ZN8I,10.1037/cou0000382,,2020-07-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-11T01:55:23Z,2021-02-11T01:55:23Z,,438-448,,4,67,,J.

Using various sensors, precise displays and high computing powers smartphone are becoming devices that make the boost in technology. Now it is necessary to efficiently use various sensors without affecting system operation and improve control abilities for various purposes. Especially in practical applications received by mass users such as games and any kind of experience. In this article, we propose a system that allows to extend the perception of the virtual world by conveying information about the user's movements in reality into the supervised model. The system retrieves data from several sources, quickly analyzes them using artificial intelligence techniques, and returns information to the mobile phone about the activity that is being processed. The concept extends the understanding of today's virtual reality by allowing the user to move and perform simple gestures in a specially designed room. Moreover, we propose multiplayer mode in virtual reality, where players are in different places. The proposed architecture of the system has been tested on simple applications, and the results show high potential for implementations in various apps by achieving almost 90% efficiency in changing player direction in real time and only 7.5% of collision cases.

,,,,,,,,,,Understanding AI - Can and Should we Empathize with Robots?,"Expanding the debate about empathy with human beings, animals, or fictional characters to include human-robot relationships, this paper proposes two different perspectives from which to assess the scope and limits of empathy with robots: the first is epistemological, while the second is normative. The epistemological approach helps us to clarify whether we can empathize with artificial intelligence or, more precisely, with social robots. The main puzzle here concerns, among other things, exactly what it is that we empathize with if robots do not have emotions or beliefs, since they do not have a consciousness in an elaborate sense. However, by comparing robots with fictional characters, the paper shows that we can still empathize with robots and that many of the existing accounts of empathy and mindreading are compatible with such a view. By so doing, the paper focuses on the significance of perspective-taking and claims that we also ascribe to robots something like a perspectival experience. The normative approach examines the moral impact of empathizing with robots. In this regard, the paper critically discusses three possible responses: strategic, anti-barbarizational, and pragmatist. The latter position is defended by stressing that we are increasingly compelled to interact with robots in a shared world and that to take robots into our moral consideration should be seen as an integral part of our self- and other-understanding.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2020,"Schmetkamp, Susanne",Review of Philosophy and Psychology,,1878-5158,X4L5EAZ3,10.1007/s13164-020-00473-x,,2020-12-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-11T01:55:23Z,2021-02-11T01:55:23Z,,881-897,,4,11,,Rev.

In near future, Al is likely to take a central place in health care with everything revolving round its mechanics. The era of Al envisages new roles of a physician and health professionals should realise the importance of being efficient in interacting with these machines in an efficient manner. Patient psychology and empathy shall take a central place in patient care and budding doctors should be braced with such relevant competencies. Accordingly, Al needs to find a suitable place within the curriculum of medical education that deals with technology, interactive learning environments and managing Al systems.

,,,,,,,,,,The Empirical Challenge of 21st-Century Medical Education,"Medical education is at a crossroads. Facing challenges wrought by science and technology as well as societal change, the curriculum is increasingly out of synch with new needs in teaching content and medical practice. The path to significant curricular reform is difficult because of a variety of factors, including deeply entrenched values, the natural resistance to change, and the accreditation process. Indeed, even the very definition of what it means to be a professional is changing with profound implications for the future role of the physician and the sacrosanct doctor-patient relationship. In this Invited Commentary, the author enumerates challenges facing medical education in the current era. To address these challenges, the author recommends specific curricular emphases for 21st-century medical education: knowledge capture and curation, collaboration with and management of artificial intelligence applications, a deep understanding of probabilistic reasoning, and the cultivation of empathy and compassion in accordance with ethical standards. Given these needs, it is imperative that schools act today to undertake significant curricular reform and, in so doing, strive to make the hard changes necessary to produce optimal practitioners in a rapidly transforming 21st century.

,,,,,,,,,,Leveraging Technology to Sustain Extraordinary Care A Qualitative Analysis of Meaningful Nurse Recognition,"OBJECTIVE: Meaningful recognition of nurses submitted by patients and families using interactive patient care (IPC) technology was analyzed using artificial intelligence (AI) to identify the themes and behaviors associated with extraordinary nursing. BACKGROUND: Meaningful recognition positively impacts nursing and organizational outcomes. The use of AI techniques such as natural language processing andmachine learning to identify and describe behaviors impacting patient experiences is an emerging science. METHODS: Nurse recognition comments were collected from a convenience sample of 3 organizations via an IPC inpatient platform and analyzed using the AI techniques of natural language processing, machine learning, sentiment analytics, and corollary dictionaries based on rules of linguistics. RESULTS: The top theme of nursing recognition comments was courtesy and respect with the behaviors of empathy/compassion, helpfulness, kindness, attentiveness, and emotional comfort. The theme of skills/knowledge was the 2nd most common, with the behaviors of being professional, knowledgeable, keeping track, competence, dedication, and being thorough. CONCLUSIONS: AI techniques for qualitative analysis of comments collected through IPC reveal nurse themes and behaviors most meaningful to patients and their family members. Nurses can advance the science of AI and guide its evolution so that nurse caring behaviors associated with establishing human connections that positively influence patient and family experience are accurately represented.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2019,"Clavelle, Joanne T.; Sweeney, Cynthia D.; Swartwout, Ellen; Lefton, Cindy; Guney, Senem",Journal of Nursing Administration,,0002-0443,SL24NJ4W,10.1097/NNA.0000000000000757,,2019-06-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-11T01:55:23Z,2021-02-11T01:55:23Z,,303-309,,6,49,,J.

,,,,,,,,,,Current and future challenges in critical care medicine,"Actual and future challenges in critical care medicine among others include changes in the demographic structure of Western societies leading to a growing number of aged and very old patients to be treated in the intensive care unit. Although age per se is not a good predictor for ICU survival it frequently comes along with several comorbidities influencing not only ICU but also one to five year survival as well as quality of life compared to a matched non-post-ICU population. Therefore, risk stratification among others seeking for signs of frailty in addition to the development of instruments in order to estimate the post-ICU quality of life are important in order to perform a sound risk-benefit analysis. For patients at risk scheduled for a major intervention pre-interventional interdisciplinary case analysis and discussion including patient and next of kin is warranted. Moreover, aged patients are at risk for under and overtreatment why clear written strategies adapted to the individual case have to be established. With regard to the development of more and more advanced treatment options in patients who finally cannot be cured a change of paradigm concerning palliative care is urgently needed. In these situations palliative care should not be seen as treatment option in the last days only but as accompanying support as soon as it is recognized that cure is not possible. This allows the patient to discuss and establish an advanced care planning together with the care givers. Major challenges in the very near future result from advances in personalized medicine (including genetic analysis) and from digital transformations of our societies. Both are closely connected and will change modern medicine within the next 15 years entirely. Expert systems with artificial intelligence and robots will support but also confront health care professionals with their limitations and hopefully remind them that medicine is not only science but also art and that the digital world at least for a while cannot provide clinical judgment, empathy and humanity as good as human beings.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2017,"Stocker, Reto",Therapeutische Umschau,,0040-5930,W73GFA8T,10.1024/0040-5930/a000879,,2017-07-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-11T01:55:38Z,2021-02-11T01:55:38Z,,25-31,,2,74,,Ther.

,,,,,,,,,,A Modified Neural Network Relaying for High Efficiency Biomedical Power Transformer Protection,"The main element in a power system is the power transformer. A transformer set-up forms the central element in transmitting and distributing power. There is heavy transmission loss if the power system is defective. The transformers should be protected from internal faults and magnetic inrush currents. The power demands for a biomedical research center or hospital are higher and need to be consistent for the working of all biomedical equipments used. This paper proposes transient detection techniques using Wavelet transform (WT). The advantage of WT is that, it can represent current and voltage signals. Empathy of transients is very fast and precise so this work tends to elaborate on a new wavelet method to classify the inrush currents from power system disturbances. The classification problems in Artificial Intelligence (AI) are solved using neural networks. The neural networks derive its inspiration from neurons present in human body. The performance of NN is assessed based on the design of the hidden layers and by evaluating the weights that connect the nodes. There are no modifications made to the design of the hidden layers as the weight calculated is more important than the hidden structure. An optimum solution can be obtained by calculating the weights of NN by decreasing the function cost or error. This work aims to propose a modified neural network. The neural networks are trained using Firefly Algorithm (FA). Since this protocol is a simple and an efficient metaheuristic optimization technique which draws inspiration from fireflies which tend to move towards brighter light.

One hundred and seventy-two participants with a wide range of music playing backgrounds rated sound recordings of 7 performances of piano music by Kuhlau, one played by a human, and six generated by algorithms, including a mechanical' and an unmusical' rendering. Participants rated the extent to which each performance was by a human and explained their answers. The mechanical performance had the lowest mean rating, but the human performance was rated as statistically identical to the other stimuli. There were no differences between ratings made by classical piano experts and lay listeners, but despite this, the musicians were more confident with their ratings. Qualitative analysis revealed five broad themes that contribute to judging whether a piece appears to be human. The themes were labelled (in descending order of frequency) intuitive, expressive, imperfections, halo (global preference) and empathy. This paper presents new evidence systematically demonstrating that algorithm generated performances of piano music can be indistinguishable from human performances, suggesting some parallels with the 1990s victory of the Deep Blue computer of the world champion (human) chess player.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2017,"Schubert, Emery; Canazza, Sergio; De Poli, Giovanni; Roda, Antonio",Journal of New Music Research,,0929-8215,X2WYKJNC,10.1080/09298215.2016.1264976,,2017-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-11T01:55:38Z,2021-02-11T01:55:38Z,,175-186,,2,46,,J.

Relationships with computers, which necessarily displace relationships with other humans, have so far been shown to be dissatisfying.

,,,,,,,,,,"Empathy, Education and AI","The concept of empathy has multiple meanings. In the present paper we present an experiment in which the relationship between empathy and spatial perspective Berthoz and Jorland (L'Empathie, 2004) acquires a significant role in the process of structural coupling Maturana and Varela (The tree of knowledge: the biological roots of human understanding, 1992) and Damiano (UnitA in dialogo. Un nuovo stile per la conoscenza, 2009). The concept of empathy in education is at the basis of the relation between teacher and students and between teaching and learning. Thus the concepts of co-activity Vinatier and Numa-Bocage (Revue fran double dagger aise de p,dagogie, 158:85-101, 2007) and of structural coupling have analogies with empathy and can provide operational indications. The research question is the following: is it possible to detect the presence of a structural coupling and of empathic processes in a class of students and their teachers through the mediation of a conceptual space created by an automated AI system? The present contribution analyses the use of an AI plug-in developed within the European project I-TUTOR. In the experiment the artefact plays the role of mediator between the teacher and the students and lets their different perspectives be compared. The artefact does not engage in dialogue with the student in a one-to-one relationship, but it is a vertex of the student-artefact-teacher triangle. The artefact, an automated space, fosters a comparison between the perspective of the student and that of the teacher in relation to the dominant teaching object of the course. The paper describes the findings of the experiment run with two groups of students and proposes some changes to be worked into the plug-in to foster further empathic processes.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2015,"Rossi, Pier Giuseppe; Fedeli, Laura",International Journal of Social Robotics,,1875-4791,WUPS2XS7,10.1007/s12369-014-0272-9,,2015-02-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-11T01:55:38Z,2021-02-11T01:55:38Z,,103-109,,1,7,,Int.

,,,,,,,,,,Are They Really Trying to Save Their Buddy? The Anthropomorphism of Animal Epimeletic Behaviours,"Simple Summary Anthropomorphism, defined as attributing human traits to animals and other entities, seems to have appeared during evolution to improve an individual's understanding of other species (or indeed the world in general). Yet anthropomorphism can have beneficial or harmful consequences especially for animals, and there seems to be little interest in monitoring the potential danger of this approach. Few studies have focused on the factors affecting how we attribute intentions or beliefs to animals, and more quantitative studies are needed to identify how and why humans attribute mental states and cognitive abilities to other animals. In this study, participants answer questions about three videos in which an individual (a sparrow, an elephant and a macaque, respectively) displayed behaviours towards an inanimate conspecific that suddenly regained consciousness at the end of the footage. A fourth video showed a robot dog being kicked by an engineer to demonstrate its stability. These questions were designed to measure how far participants attribute humanlike intentions, beliefs or mental states to non-human animals and robots. Men and older participants are less likely to attribute humanlike mental states to animals. Similarly, people who work with animals or have at least one pet at home demonstrated less naive anthropomorphism. Conversely, we found that members of animal protection associations showed more biophilia (affinity for other living organisms), attributed more intentions and mental states to animals and were further from biological reality (current scientific knowledge of each species) than non-members. Understanding the potential usefulness of these factors can lead to better relationships with animals and encourage human-robot interactions. Anthropomorphism is a natural tendency in humans, but it is also influenced by many characteristics of the observer (the human) and the observed entity (here, the animal species). This study asked participants to complete an online questionnaire about three videos showing epimeletic behaviours in three animal species. In the videos, an individual (a sparrow, an elephant and a macaque, respectively) displayed behaviours towards an inanimate conspecific that suddenly regained consciousness at the end of the footage. A fourth video showed a robot dog being kicked by an engineer to demonstrate its stability. Each video was followed by a series of questions designed to evaluate the degree of anthropomorphism of participants, from mentaphobia (no attribution of intentions and beliefs, whatever the animal species) to full anthropomorphism (full attribution of intentions and beliefs by animals, to the same extent as in humans) and to measure how far the participants had correctly assessed each situation in terms of biological reality (current scientific knowledge of each species). There is a negative correlation (about 61%) between the mental states attributed to animals by humans and the real capability of animals. The heterogeneity of responses proved that humans display different forms of anthropomorphism, from rejecting all emotional or intentional states in animals to considering animals to show the same intentions as humans. However, the scores participants attributed to animals differed according to the species shown in the video and to human socio-demographic characteristics. Understanding the potential usefulness of these factors can lead to better relationships with animals and encourage a positive view of human-robot interactions. Indeed, reflective or critical anthropomorphism can increase our humanity.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2020,"Sueur, Cedric; Forin-Wiart, Marie-Amelie; Pele, Marie",ANIMALS,,2076-2615,HKF5CINN,10.3390/ani10122323,,2020-12-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-11T03:48:10Z,2021-02-11T03:48:10Z,,,,12,10,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND Publisher: MDPI Type: Article",,,,empathy; robot; animal ethics; birds; cognitive biases; comparative thanatology; elephants; mentaphobia; primates,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web of Science,are they really trying to save their buddy? the anthropomorphism of animal epimeletic behaviours,are they really trying to save their buddy the anthropomorphism of animal epimeletic behaviours

In these application areas, a social robot can take the role of a coach by training and assisting individuals also in cognitive tasks. Since a robot's interaction style affects users' trust and acceptance, customizing its behavior to the proposed tasks could, potentially, have an impact on the users' performance. To investigate these phenomena, we enrolled sixty volunteers and endowed a social robot with afriendlyand anauthoritarianinteraction style. The aim was to explore whether and how the robot's interaction style could enhance users' cognitive performance during a psychometric evaluation. The results showed that theauthoritarianinteraction style seems to be more appropriate to improve the performance when the tasks require high cognitive demands. These differences in cognitive performance between the groups did not depend on users' intrinsic characteristics, such as gender and personality traits. Nevertheless, in theauthoritariancondition, participants' cognitive performance was related to their trust and the acceptance of the technology. Finally, we found that users' non-compliant behavior was not related to their personality traits. This finding indirectly supports the role of the robot's interaction style in influencing the compliance behavior of the users.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,,"Maggi, Gianpaolo; Dell'Aquila, Elena; Cucciniello, Ilenia; Rossi, Silvia",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ROBOTICS,,1875-4791,MWIP9PRH,10.1007/s12369-020-00702-4,,2010-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-11T03:48:11Z,2021-02-11T03:48:11Z,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article; Early Access",,,,Social robots; Cognitive performance; Non-verbal features; Robot's behavior,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web of Science,"“don't get distracted!”: the role of social robots' interaction style on users' cognitive performance, acceptance, and non-compliant behavior",dont get distracted the role of social robots interaction style on users cognitive performance acceptance and noncompliant behavior
,,,,,,,,,,Alexithymic personality in Philip K. Dick'sDo androids dream of electric sheep?,"The official definition for alexithymia dates back to 1973, when Sifneos described its symptoms. Persons affected by this condition are unable to verbally describe their feelings. For many years this condition was relatively little known, but nowadays people are talking about it more and more. In forums in which the patients' comments are posted, it is often underscored how this particular mental state is similar to that of the androids described in the novelDo androids dream of electric sheep? by Philip K. Dick. The Dickian clinical references were those in use during the 1960s. Therefore, to special characteristics that Philip Dick attributed to his robots (coldness and lack of human empathy, and simultaneous desire for social acceptance), the writer, and then the critics, assigned the label of schizophrenia, the only one that the psychiatric manuals of that time associated to such symptoms. Today, if Dick were alive and were to write about his androids, he most likely would no longer use the term schizophrenics, but instead the term alexithymics, which are more socially adaptive than schizophrenics, just like his androids. Making retrospective diagnoses of literary characters is anachronistic; as it was done for decades by critics to consider the Dickian androids schizophrenics: in the fiction story they are not schizophrenics but robots. However a new psychological trait such as alexithymia can revisit that same story by giving it a new symbolic meaning. The aims of this article are: to highlight how the old nosological categories of schizophrenia, generally referred to when commentingDo androids dream of electric sheep?, should be supplemented by the category of alexithymia; to analyze the scenes in which the characters have typical alexithymic behaviors, trying to prove that alexithymia is actually best suited for describing the androids invented by Dick.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2020,"Gramantieri, Riccardo",NEOHELICON,,0324-4652,FHW8T4G9,10.1007/s11059-020-00544-z,,2020-12-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-11T03:48:13Z,2021-02-11T03:48:13Z,,673-683,,"2, SI",47,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article",,,,Schizophrenia; Affective disorders; Alexithymia; Dick; Do androids dream of electric sheep?; Philip K,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web of Science,alexithymic personality in philip k. dick'sdo androids dream of electric sheep?,alexithymic personality in philip k dicksdo androids dream of electric sheep
,,,,,,,,,,Modeling empathy: building a link between affective and cognitive processes,"Computational modeling of empathy has recently become an increasingly popular way of studying human relations. It provides a way to increase our understanding of the link between affective and cognitive processes and enhance our interaction with artificial agents. However, the variety of fields contributing to empathy research has resulted in isolated approaches to modeling empathy, and this has led to various definitions of empathy and an absence of common ground regarding underlying empathic processes. Although this diversity may be useful in that it allows for an in-depth examination of various processes linked to empathy, it also may not yet provide a coherent theoretical picture of empathy. We argue that a clear theoretical positioning is required for collective progress. The aim of this article is, therefore, to call for a holistic and multilayered view of a model of empathy, taken from the rich background research from various disciplines. To achieve this, we present a comprehensive background on the theoretical foundations, followed by the working definitions, components, and models of empathy that are proposed by various fields. Following this introduction, we provide a detailed review of the existing techniques used in AI research to model empathy in interactive agents, focusing on the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.

,,,,,,,,,,"The Interplay Between Emotional Intelligence, Trust, and Gender in Human-Robot Interaction A Vignette-Based Study","As robots begin to enter roles in which they work closely with human teammates or peers, it is critical to understand how people trust them based on how they interpret the robot's behavior. In this paper we investigated the interplay between trust in a robot and people's perceptions of the robot's emotional intelligence. We used a vignette-based method to explore the following questions: (1) Do subjects perceive differences in robot EI, and is their trust in the robot influenced by differences in the robot's reliability and capability? (2) Does a robot's EI influence how much it is trusted and conversely does a robot's capability and reliability influence how emotionally intelligent it is perceived to be? (3) Do people trust male and female robots differently when the robots exhibit different levels of EI or different levels of capability and reliability, and do gender stereotypical expectations related to EI transfer to trust?; (4) Does focusing on the robot's EI increase one's trust in the robot? (5) Is the interplay between trust, EI and gender the same for different levels of evoked social presence and human-likeness (i.e., when the interaction is presented in different modalities, text or spoken dialogue when the robot's voice is actually heard)? We found that trust in the robot was influenced by the level of the robot's EI (p < .001) and that gender stereotypical expectations related to EI were transferred to trust (p = .006), but gender effects on trust disappeared when only capability and reliability (robot's trustworthiness) were manipulated but not the robot's EI (p = .103). Surprisingly, we found that people trusted the robot more when the interaction was presented in text format (p = .024), going against our hypothesis that spoken dialogue would evoke more social presence and thus bolster EI perception and instill more trust. We suggest that this effect might be due to people's expectations of a more expressive and human-like voice. Finally, we also found that people's trust ratings in the robot were higher when they were made to notice and think about the robot's EI, by answering EI questionnaires prior to trust questionnaires (p = .022).

,,,,,,,,,,THE RED MACHINE: THE DEHUMANIZATION OF THE COMMUNIST ENEMY IN AMERICAN COLD WAR CINEMA,"This article deals with the US Cold War cinematographic construction of the Soviet enemy. The researcher focuses on the means of dehumanising the communist enemy, external and internal, by equating it to a machine. The author applies Nick Haslam's dual model of dehumanization (2006), according to which dehumanization is visible in two main forms: animalistic, by associating members of the out-group with animals, and mechanistic, by associating them with a soulless machine. The materials used consist of US films from the “Long Fifties”, in which Hollywood, equating the enemy to machines, developed three plots: the robotic existence of individuals in a totalitarian society; the transformation of Americans into zombies by communists by means of Soviet science; and the body snatching of Americans by an alien mind, an allegory of a future communist occupation of the USA. The article demonstrates that dehumanization was implemented by directly labeling the representatives of the communist world as robots and by attributing to them a lack of emotions, consciousness, will, individuality, initiative, warmth, love, friendship, creative abilities, and even the ability to smile. Such an image of the enemy implied a moral exclusion, treating them as an inanimate object unworthy of empathy, including in the event of their destruction. The author points out that the use of mechanistic dehumanization was very effective. Essentialization of the differences between “us” and “them” occurred: the symbolic border between them is presented as a boundary between living and nonliving. The image of mortal danger was created: the “Red Machine” is strong and merciless, it cannot be moved to pity, and so it is permissible to destroy it. This image contributed to the legitimation of power: the political opponents of the authorities are represented as internal enemies who are anxious to turn Americans into obedient executors of someone else's will and to deprive them of humanity. At the same time, the machine also has weaknesses, and it is possible to defeat it: since it is devoid of human creativity, it is clearly inferior to the free human spirit embodied in America.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2020,"Riabov, Oleg",QUAESTIO ROSSICA,,2311-911X,CK4GK5PF,10.15826/qr.2020.2.479,,2020-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-11T03:48:16Z,2021-02-11T03:48:16Z,,536-550,,2,8,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: PROSPEKT LENINA 51, EKATERINBURG, 620083, RUSSIA Publisher: URAL FEDERAL UNIV Type: Article",,,,dehumanization; Cold War; image of Russia; image of the enemy; propaganda; US cinema,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web of Science,the red machine: the dehumanization of the communist enemy in american cold war cinema,the red machine the dehumanization of the communist enemy in american cold war cinema

Focusing on the pupil response in human voice communication, we analyzed the pupil response during utterance, and demonstrated that the pupil enlarges and contracts in synchronization with the burst-pause (ON-OFF) of the utterance. In addition, it was confirmed that the pupil response is effective for enhancing affective conveyance by using the developed system in which an interactive CG character generates the pupil response based on the synchronization with the burst-pause of utterance. In this study, we developed a video communication system with a virtual pupil CG superimposed on the partner's pupil for enhancing affective conveyance. This system generates a virtual pupil response in synchronization with the talker's burst-pause of utterance. We performed a communication experiment under the condition that the virtual pupil CG is generated by being synchronized with the talker's burst-pause of utterance.

,,,,,,,,,,A Robot-Based Play-Drama Intervention May Improve the Joint Attention and Functional Play Behaviors of Chinese-Speaking Preschoolers with Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Pilot Study,Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have deficits in joint attention and play behaviors. We examined whether a robot-based play-drama intervention would promote these skills. Chinese-speaking preschool children were randomly assigned to an intervention group (N = 12) and a waitlist control group (N = 11). Children in the intervention group watched three robot dramas and engaged in role-plays with both robots and human experimenters over the course of 9 weeks. There were significant improvements in joint attention initiations and functional play behaviors in the intervention group. Parents of this group of children also reported less severe social impairments. It was therefore concluded that a robot-based play-drama intervention can enhance the joint attention and play behaviors of children with ASD.,,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2020,"So, Wing-Chee; Cheng, Chun-Ho; Lam, Wan-Yi; Huang, Ying; Ng, Ka-Ching; Tung, Hiu-Ching; Wong, Wing",JOURNAL OF AUTISM AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS,,0162-3257,2QBT33G3,10.1007/s10803-019-04270-z,,2020-02-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-11T03:48:17Z,2021-02-11T03:48:17Z,,467-481,,2,50,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: 233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA Publisher: SPRINGER/PLENUM PUBLISHERS Type: Article",,,,Social robots; Autism; Early childhood; Functional play; Intervention; Joint attention,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web of Science,a robot-based play-drama intervention may improve the joint attention and functional play behaviors of chinese-speaking preschoolers with autism spectrum disorder: a pilot study,a robotbased playdrama intervention may improve the joint attention and functional play behaviors of chinesespeaking preschoolers with autism spectrum disorder a pilot study
,,,,,,,,,,INTRApersonal Synchrony as Constituent of INTERpersonal Synchrony and Its Relevance for Autism Spectrum Disorder,"INTERpersonal synchrony leads to increased empathy, rapport and understanding, enabling successful human-human interactions and reciprocal bonding. Research shows that individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) exhibit difficulties to INTERpersonally synchronize but underlying causes are yet unknown. In order to successfully synchronize with others, INTRApersonal synchronization of communicative signals appears to be a necessary prerequisite. We understand INTRApersonal synchrony as an implicit factor of INTERpersonal synchrony and therefore hypothesize that atypicalities of INTRApersonal synchrony may add to INTERpersonal synchrony problems in ASD and their interaction partners. In this perspective article, we first review evidence for INTERpersonal dissynchrony in ASD, with respect to different approaches and assessment methods. Second, we draft a theoretical conceptualization of INTRApersonal dissynchrony in ASD based on a temporal model of human interaction. We will outline literature indicating INTRApersonal dissynchrony in ASD, therefore highlighting findings of atypical timing functions and findings from clinical and behavioral studies that indicate peculiar motion patterns and communicative signal production in ASD. Third, we hypothesize that findings from these domains suggest an assessment and investigation of temporal parameters of social behavior in individuals with ASD. We will further propose specific goals of empirical approaches on INTRApersonal dissynchrony. Finally we present implications of research on INTRApersonal timing in ASD for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, what in our opinion warrants the increase of research efforts in this domain.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2019,"Bloch, Carola; Vogeley, Kai; Georgescu, Alexandra L.; Falter-Wagner, Christine M.",FRONTIERS IN ROBOTICS AND AI,,2296-9144,QXK55PE5,10.3389/frobt.2019.00073,,2019-08-20T00:00:00Z,2021-02-11T03:48:18Z,2021-02-11T03:48:18Z,,,,,6,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND Publisher: FRONTIERS MEDIA SA Type: Article",,,,human-human interaction; non-verbal behavior; autism spectrum disorder; INTERpersonal synchrony; INTRApersonal synchrony; timing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web of Science,intrapersonal synchrony as constituent of interpersonal synchrony and its relevance for autism spectrum disorder,intrapersonal synchrony as constituent of interpersonal synchrony and its relevance for autism spectrum disorder

One reason for this may be the fact that we tend to anthropomorphize the other to be able to empathize with it. In light of this, how can we infer communication signs of other species so we are able to connect with the nonhuman world? We look for answers to this question by adopting a phenomenological approach that allows us to decentre from the anthropocentric perspective. We highlight animal studies, especially those that extend to them the notion of play, and the studies on interspecies playful interaction conducted in the context of animal- computer interaction.

,,,,,,,,,,Bioinspired decision-making for a socially interactive robot,"Nowadays, robots and humans coexist in real settings where robots need to interact autonomously making their own decisions. Many applications require that robots adapt their behavior to different users and remember each user's preferences to engage them in the interaction. To this end, we propose a decision making system for social robots that drives their actions taking into account the user and the robot's state. This system is based on bio-inspired concepts, such as motivations, drives and wellbeing, that facilitate the rise of natural behaviors to ease the acceptance of the robot by the users. The system has been designed to promote the human-robot interaction by using drives and motivations related with social aspects, such as the users' satisfaction or the need of social interaction. Furthermore, the changes of state produced by the users' exogenous actions have been modeled as transitional states that are considered when the next robot's action has to be selected. Our system has been evaluated considering two different user profiles. In the proposed system, user's preferences are considered and alter the homeostatic process that controls the decision making system. As a result, using reinforcement learning algorithms and considering the robot's wellbeing as the reward function, the social robot Mini has learned from scratch two different policies of action, one for each user, that fit the users' preferences. The robot learned behaviors that maximize its wellbeing as well as keep the users engaged in the interactions. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The environment makes use of embodied affordances and educational robotics and consists of two parts: an augmented 3D-tangible model of southern Europe with finger-based interaction and a second floor-based augmented robotics track depicting European landmarks, where students are asked to perform tasks with Mindstorms EV3 robots. The game scenario describes a treasure hunt around Europe and students swap between finger-based and robotics-based interactive surfaces in two pairs. We evaluated our intervention with pre-service teachers in six groups of three or four who played with the environment for approximately 45 minutes each. Data collection was performed through pre- and post-knowledge test, attitude questionnaire and a semi-formal group interview. The answers showed that the mixed reality environment improved motivation, engagement and enhanced their orientation around Europe's geophysical features.

,,,,,,,,,,People are averse to machines making moral decisions,"Do people want autonomous machines making moral decisions? Nine studies suggest that that the answer is `no'-in part because machines lack a complete mind. Studies 1-6 find that people are averse to machines making morally-relevant driving, legal, medical, and military decisions, and that this aversion is mediated by the perception that machines can neither fully think nor feel. Studies 5-6 find that this aversion exists even when moral decisions have positive outcomes. Studies 7-9 briefly investigate three potential routes to increasing the acceptability of machine moral decision-making: limiting the machine to an advisory role (Study 7), increasing machines' perceived experience (Study 8), and increasing machines' perceived expertise (Study 9). Although some of these routes show promise, the aversion to machine moral decision-making is difficult to eliminate.

,,,,,,,,,,Cues of Violent Intergroup Conflict Diminish Perceptions of Robotic Personhood,"Convergent lines of evidence indicate that anthropomorphic robots are represented using neurocognitive mechanisms typically employed in social reasoning about other people. Relatedly, a growing literature documents that contexts of threat can exacerbate coalitional biases in social perceptions. Integrating these research programs, the present studies test whether cues of violent intergroup conflict modulate perceptions of the intelligence, emotional experience, or overall personhood of robots. In Studies 1 and 2, participants evaluated a large, bipedal all-terrain robot; in Study 3, participants evaluated a small, social robot with humanlike facial and vocal characteristics. Across all studies, cues of violent conflict caused significant decreases in perceived robotic personhood, and these shifts were mediated by parallel reductions in emotional connection with the robot (with no significant effects of threat on attributions of intelligence/skill). In addition, in Study 2, participants in the conflict condition estimated the large bipedal robot to be less effective in military combat, and this difference was mediated by the reduction in perceived robotic personhood. These results are discussed as they motivate future investigation into the links among threat, coalitional bias and human-robot interaction.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2018,"Holbrook, Colin",ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INTERACTIVE IN℡LIGENT SYSTEMS,,2160-6455,FCCU74GB,10.1145/3181674,,2018-11-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-11T03:48:22Z,2021-02-11T03:48:22Z,,,,4,8,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: 2 PENN PLAZA, STE 701, NEW YORK, NY 10121-0701 USA Publisher: ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY Type: Article",,,,Theory of Mind; empathy; human-robot interaction; group prejudice; Threat detection,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web of Science,cues of violent intergroup conflict diminish perceptions of robotic personhood,cues of violent intergroup conflict diminish perceptions of robotic personhood
,,,,,,,,,,"The Effects of Humanlike and Robot-Specific Affective Nonverbal Behavior on Perception, Emotion, and Behavior","Research demonstrated that humans are able to interpret humanlike (affective) nonverbal behavior (HNB) in artificial entities (e.g. Beck et al., in: Proceedings of the 19th IEEE international symposium on robot and human interactive communication, IEEE Press, Piscataway, 2010. 10.1109/ROMAN.2010.5598649; Bente et al. in J Nonverbal Behav 25: 151-166, 2001; Mumm and Mutlu, in: Proceedings of the 6th international conference on human-robot interaction, HRI. ACM Press, New York, 2011. 10.1145/1957656.1957786). However, some robots lack the possibility to produce HNB. Using robot-specific nonverbal behavior (RNB) such as different eye colors to convey emotional meaning might be a fruitful mechanism to enhance HRI experiences, but it is unclear whether RNB is as effective as HNB. We present a review on affective nonverbal behaviors in robots and an experimental study. We experimentally tested the influence of HNB and RNB (colored LEDs) on users' perception of the robot (e.g. likeability, animacy), their emotional experience, and self-disclosure. In a between-subjects design, users interacted with either (a) a robot displaying no nonverbal behavior, (b) a robot displaying affective RNB, (c) a robot displaying affective HNB or (d) a robot displaying affective HNB and RNB. Results show that HNB, but not RNB, has a significant effect on the perceived animacy of the robot, participants' emotional state, and self-disclosure. However, RNB still slightly influenced participants' perception, emotion, and behavior: Planned contrasts revealed having any type of nonverbal behavior significantly increased perceived animacy, positive affect, and self-disclosure. Moreover, observed linear trends indicate that the effects increased with the addition of nonverbal behaviors (control< RNB< HNB). In combination, our results suggest that HNB is more effective in transporting the robot's communicative message than RNB.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2018,"Puetten, Astrid M.

Empathy, Moral Standing, and the Language of Suffering","This paper tries to understand the phenomenon that humans are able to empathize with robots and the intuition that there might be something wrong with “abusing” robots by discussing the question regarding the moral standing of robots. After a review of some relevant work in empirical psychology and a discussion of the ethics of empathizing with robots, a philosophical argument concerning the moral standing of robots is made that questions distant and uncritical moral reasoning about entities' properties and that recommends first trying to understand the issue by means of philosophical and artistic work that shows how ethics is always relational and historical, and that highlights the importance of language and appearance in moral reasoning and moral psychology. It is concluded that attention to relationality and to verbal and non-verbal languages of suffering is key to understand the phenomenon under investigation, and that in robot ethics we need less certainty and more caution and patience when it comes to thinking about moral standing.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2018,"Coeckelbergh, Mark",KAIROS-JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY & SCIENCE,,1647-659X,UVHRV3YM,10.2478/kjps-2018-0007,,2018-06-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-11T03:48:23Z,2021-02-11T03:48:23Z,,141-158,,1,20,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: DE GRUYTER POLAND SP Z O O, BOGUMILA ZUGA 32A STR, 01-811 WARSAW, POLAND Publisher: SCIENDO Type: Article",,,,robots; empathy; language; phenomenology; art; hermeneutics; moral standing; relations; Wittgenstein,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web of Science,"why care about robots? empathy, moral standing, and the language of suffering",why care about robots empathy moral standing and the language of suffering
,,,,,,,,,,Faces of Emotion: Investigating Emotional Facial Expressions Towards a Robot,"Emotions have always been an intriguing topic in everyday life as well as in science. As robots are starting to move from industry halls to our private homes, emotions have become a vital theme for the field of human-robot interaction. Since Darwin, research suggests facial expressions are associated with emotions. Facial expressions could provide an ideal tool for a natural, social human-robot interaction. Despite a growing body of research on the implementation of emotions in robots (mostly based on facial expressions), systematic research on users' emotions and facial expressions towards robots remains largely neglected (cf. Arkin and Moshkina in Calvo R, D'Mello S, Gratch J, Kappas A (eds) The Oxford handbook of affective computing. Oxford University Press, New York, pp 483-493, 2015 on challenges in effective testing in affective human-robot interaction). We experimentally investigated the multilevel phenomenon of emotions by using a multi-method approach. Since self-reports of emotions are prone to biases such as social desirability, we supplemented it by an objective behavioral measurement. By using the Facial Action Coding System we analyzed the facial expressions of 62 participants who watched the entertainment robot dinosaur Pleo either in a friendly interaction or being tortured. Participants differed in the type and frequency of Action Units displayed as well as in their self-reported feelings depending on the type of treatment they had watched (friendly or torture). In line with a previous study by Rosenthal-von der Putten et al. (Int J Soc Robot 5(1):17-34, 2013. https://doi.org/10.1007/s12369-012-0173-8), participants reported feeling more positive after the friendly video and more negative after the torture video. In the torture condition, participants furthermore showed a wide range of different Action Units primarily associated with negative emotions. For example, the Action Unit 4 (”Brow Lowerer”) that is common in negative emotions such as anger and sadness was displayed more frequently in the torture condition than in the friendly condition. The Action Unit 12 (”Lip Corner Puller”) however, an Action Unit commonly associated with joy, was present in both conditions and thus not necessarily predictive of positive emotions. The findings indicate the importance for a thorough investigation of the variables of emotional facial expressions. In investigating the Action Units participants display due to an emotional situation, we aim to provide information on spontaneous facial expressions towards a robot that could also serve as guidance for automatic approaches.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2018,"Menne, Isabelle M.; Schwab, Frank",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ROBOTICS,,1875-4791,JNPXQWLG,10.1007/s12369-017-0447-2,,2018-04-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-11T03:48:23Z,2021-02-11T03:48:23Z,,199-209,,"2, SI",10,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article",,,,Emotion; Empathy; Human-robot interaction; Emotional response; Facial Action Coding System; Facial expression,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web of Science,faces of emotion: investigating emotional facial expressions towards a robot,faces of emotion investigating emotional facial expressions towards a robot
,,,,,,,,,,DEPERSONALISATION OF KILLING Towards A 21st Century Use Of Force “Beyond Good And Evil?”,The article analyses how robotisation as the latest advance in military technology can depersonalise the methods of killing in the 21st century by turning enemy soldiers and civilians into mere objects devoid of moral value. The departing assumption is that robotisation of warfare transforms military operations into automated industrial processes with the aim of removing empathy as a redundant `cost'. The development of autonomous weapons systems raises a number of sharp ethical controversies related to the projected moral insensitivity of robots regarding the treatment of enemies and civilian population. The futurist vision of war as a foreign policy instrument entirely `purified' of the risk of morally wrong actions is in opposition with the negative effects of the use of drones. The author concludes that the use of lethal robots in combat would eventually remove enemy soldiers and civilians from the realm of ethical reasoning and deprive them of human dignity.

The main challenge of this paper is study whether people's empathic reactions towards robots change depending on previous information given to human about the robot before the interaction. The use of false data about robot skills creates different levels of what we call `fake empathy'. This study performs an experiment in WOZ environment in which different subjects (n=17) interacting with the same robot while they believe that the robot is a different robot, up to three versions. Each robot scenario provides a different `humanoid' description, and out hypothesis is that the more human-like looks the robot, the more empathically can be the human responses.

,,,,,,,,,,Creation and Staging of Android Theatre “Sayonara” towards Developing Highly Human-Like Robots,"Even after long-term exposures, androids with a strikingly human-like appearance evoke unnatural feelings. The behavior that would induce human-like feelings after long exposures is difficult to determine, and it often depends on the cultural background of the observers. Therefore, in this study, we generate an acting performance system for the android, in which an android and a human interact in a stage play in the real world. We adopt the theatrical theory called Contemporary Colloquial Theatre Theory to give the android natural behaviors so that audiences can comfortably observe it even after long-minute exposure. A stage play is created and shown in various locations, and the audiences are requested to report their impressions of the stage and their cultural and psychological backgrounds in a self-evaluating questionnaire. Overall analysis indicates that the audience had positive feelings, in terms of attractiveness, towards the android on the stage even after 20 min of exposure. The singularly high acceptance of the android by Japanese audiences seems to be correlated with a high animism tendency, rather than to empathy. We also discuss how the stage play approach is limited and could be extended to contribute to realization of human-robot interaction in the real world.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2017,"Chikaraishi, Takenobu; Yoshikawa, Yuichiro; Ogawa, Kohei; Hirata, Oriza; Ishiguro, Hiroshi",FUTURE INTERNET,,1999-5903,TL32XQW4,10.3390/fi9040075,,2017-12-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-11T03:48:26Z,2021-02-11T03:48:26Z,,,,4,9,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND Publisher: MDPI AG Type: Article",,,,social robots; android theatre; contemporary colloquial theatre theory; robot theatre,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web of Science,creation and staging of android theatre “sayonara” towards developing highly human-like robots,creation and staging of android theatre sayonara towards developing highly humanlike robots
,,,,,,,,,,Narratives with Robots: The Impact of Interaction Context and Individual Differences on Story Recall and Emotional Understanding,"Role-play scenarios have been considered a successful learning space for children to develop their social and emotional abilities. In this paper, we investigate whether socially assistive robots in role-playing settings are as effective with small groups of children as they are with a single child and whether individual factors such as gender, grade level (first vs. second), perception of the robots (peer vs. adult), and empathy level (low vs. high) play a role in these two interaction contexts. We conducted a three-week repeated exposure experiment where 40 children interacted with socially assistive robotic characters that acted out interactive stories around words that contribute to expanding children's emotional vocabulary. Our results showed that although participants who interacted alone with the robots recalled the stories better than participants in the group condition, no significant differences were found in children's emotional interpretation of the narratives. With regard to individual differences, we found that a single child setting appeared more appropriate to first graders than a group setting, empathy level is an important predictor for emotional understanding of the narratives, and children's performance varies depending on their perception of the robots (peer vs. adult) in the two conditions.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2017,"Leite, Iolanda; McCoy, Marissa; Lohani, Monika; Ullman, Daniel; Salomons, Nicole; Stokes, Charlene; Rivers, Susan; Scassellati, Brian",FRONTIERS IN ROBOTICS AND AI,,2296-9144,YP2GKQ54,10.3389/frobt.2017.00029,,2017-07-12T00:00:00Z,2021-02-11T03:48:26Z,2021-02-11T03:48:26Z,,1-14,,,4,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND Publisher: FRONTIERS MEDIA SA Type: Article",,,,emotional intelligence; socially assistive robotics; individual differences; multiparty interaction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web of Science,narratives with robots: the impact of interaction context and individual differences on story recall and emotional understanding,narratives with robots the impact of interaction context and individual differences on story recall and emotional understanding
,,,,,,,,,,Meeting the Needs of Mothers During the Postpartum Period: Using Co-Creation Workshops to Find Technological Solutions,"Background: The postnatal period is associated with many new needs for mothers. Objective: The aim of this study was to find technological solutions that meet the needs of mothers during the year following childbirth. Methods: Two co-creation workshops were undertaken with parents and professionals. The aim of the first workshop was to create a list of all the criteria the proposed solution would have to address to meet the needs of mothers after childbirth. The aim of the second workshop was to create solutions in response to the criteria selected during the first workshop. Results: Parents and health professionals want solutions that include empathy (ie, to help fight against the feelings of abnormality and loneliness), that help mothers in daily life, that are personalized and adapted to different situations, that are educational, and that assures some continuity in their contact with health professionals. In practice, we found that parents and professionals think the solution should be accessible to everyone and available at all times. To address these criteria, technology experts proposed different solutions, such as a forum dedicated to the postpartum period that is supervised by professionals, a centralized website, a system of videoconferencing, an online exchange group, a “gift voucher” system, a virtual reality app, or a companion robot. Conclusions: The human component seems to be very important during the postnatal period. Nevertheless, technology could be a great ally in helping mothers during the postpartum period. Technology can help reliably inform parents and may also give them the right tools to find supportive people.

,,,,,,,,,,Outline of a sensory-motor perspective on intrinsically moral agents,"We propose that moral behaviour of artificial agents could (and should) be intrinsically grounded in their own sensory-motor experiences. Such an ability depends critically on seven types of competencies. First, intrinsic morality should be grounded in the internal values of the robot arising from its physiology and embodiment. Second, the moral principles of robots should develop through their interactions with the environment and with other agents. Third, we claim that the dynamics of moral (or social) emotions closely follows that of other non-social emotions used in valuation and decision making. Fourth, we explain how moral emotions can be learned from the observation of others. Fifth, we argue that to assess social interaction, a robot should be able to learn about and understand responsibility and causation. Sixth, we explain how mechanisms that can learn the consequences of actions are necessary for a robot to make moral decisions. Seventh, we describe how the moral evaluation mechanisms outlined can be extended to situations where a robot should understand the goals of others. Finally, we argue that these competencies lay the foundation for robots that can feel guilt, shame and pride, that have compassion and that know how to assign responsibility and blame.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2016,"Balkenius, Christian; Canamero, Lola; Parnamets, Philip; Johansson, Birger; Butz, Martin V.; Olsson, Andreas",ADAPTIVE BEHAVIOR,,1059-7123,GSMSCHHQ,10.1177/1059712316667203,,2016-10-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-11T03:48:27Z,2021-02-11T03:48:27Z,,306-319,,5,24,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: 1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND Publisher: SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD Type: Article",,,,empathy; Autonomous robots; embodied emotions; embodied interaction; intrinsic morality; sensory-motor grounding,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web of Science,outline of a sensory-motor perspective on intrinsically moral agents,outline of a sensorymotor perspective on intrinsically moral agents
,,,,,,,,,,Emergence of Altruistic Behavior Through the Minimization of Prediction Error,"The emergence of altruistic behavior in infants fosters their social development and supports their involvement in our society. Altruistic tendencies, intended to benefit others with no apparent rewards, are also very useful for social robots that are designed to be used in our households. Yet, to make robots capable of learning how to help others as infants do, it is important to understand the mechanisms and motives responsible for the development of altruistic behavior. Further, understanding the mechanisms behind the early development of pro-social behavior would be a great contribution to the field of developmental psychology. To these ends, we hypothesize that infants from 14 months of age help others to minimize the differences between predicted actions and observations, that is, to minimize prediction errors. To evaluate our hypothesis, we created a computational model based on psychological studies and implemented it in real and simulated robots. Our system first acquires its own sensory-motor representation by interacting with its environment. Then, using its experience, the system recognizes and predicts others' actions and uses this prediction to estimate a prediction error. Our experiments demonstrated that our robots could spontaneously generate helping behaviors by being motivated by the minimization of prediction errors.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2016,"Baraglia, Jimmy; Nagai, Yukie; Asada, Minoru",IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COGNITIVE AND DEVELOPMENTAL SYSTEMS,,2379-8920,HXUWZNQC,10.1109/TCDS.2016.2562121,,2016-09-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-11T03:48:28Z,2021-02-11T03:48:28Z,,141-151,,3,8,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA Publisher: IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC Type: Article",,,,prediction error; Altruistic behavior; cognitive developmental robotics; helping behavior,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web of Science,emergence of altruistic behavior through the minimization of prediction error,emergence of altruistic behavior through the minimization of prediction error
,,,,,,,,,,Non-anthropomorphic robots as social entities on a neurophysiological level,"The mirror-neuron-system (MNS) is involved in the perception of actions of humans and anthropomorphic robots. The current study investigates whether social interaction with a non-anthropomorphic robot is sufficient for a response of the MNS. Fifty-seven participants observed movements of a vacuum cleaning robot before and after it was handled by its owner. The robot was either humanized, being treated aggressively (n = 30), or it was treated as an object (n = 27). Electroencephalographic mu-activity is used as an index of MNS activity, because both are inversely correlated. Activity within the 8-13 Hz band was measured at central (mu activity) and occipital (alpha-activity) electrodes. Further, the level of aggressiveness displayed by the robot's owner, and the participants' compassion were rated on visual analog scales. Mu-activity showed medium-sized correlations with rated aggressiveness and compassion: The more aggressive the action towards the robot was perceived (r = -.379, p = .004), and the more compassion was felt for the robot (r = -.339, p = .010), the less pronounced mu-activity was at electrode C3 in response to the robot's movement. Thus social interaction with a non-anthropomorphic robot might establish the robot as a social entity and is sufficient to activate the human MNS. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

,,,,,,,,,,Why do children abuse robots?,"We found that children sometimes abused a social robot placed in a shopping mall hallway. They verbally abused the robot, repeatedly obstructed its path, and sometimes even kicked and punched the robot. To investigate the reasons for the abuse, we conducted a field study in which we interviewed visiting children who exhibited serious abusive behaviors, including physical contact. We analyzed interview contents to determine whether the children perceived the robot as human-like, why they abused it, and whether they thought that the robot would suffer from their abusive behavior. We obtained valid interviews from 23 children (age range, 5-9 years old) over 13 days of observations. We found that 1) the majority of the children engaged in abuse because they were curious about the robot's reactions or enjoyed abusing it and considered it human-like, and 2) about half of them believed the robot was capable of perceiving their abusive behaviors.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2016,"Nomura, Tatsuya; Kanda, Takayuki; Kidokoro, Hiroyoshi; Suehiro, Yoshitaka; Yamada, Sachie",INTERACTION STUDIES,,1572-0373,JNMBEKXW,10.1075/is.17.3.02nom,,2016-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-11T03:48:28Z,2021-02-11T03:48:28Z,,348-370,,3,17,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: PO BOX 36224, 1020 ME AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS Publisher: JOHN BENJAMINS PUBLISHING CO Type: Article",,,,children; abusive behavior; Communication robot; semi-structured interview,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web of Science,why do children abuse robots?,why do children abuse robots

To examine the effect quantitatively, we incorporated the task of cleaning up toy blocks. Performance was measured by the number of blocks children cleaned up. We compared results in three different cases: without the robot, with the robot programmed to take children's perspective in a moderate way, and with the robot programmed to take children's perspective in a strong or repeated way. The findings were very interesting. Perspective taking in both cases increased children's intimacy with the robot and enhanced cleaning performance. However, we found that strong stimuli generated a lower level of intimacy but a higher cleaning performance than moderate stimuli. On the basis of these findings, we propose potential applications of robot-mediated learning for young children.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2016,"Lee, Hawon; You, Sujeong; Ji, Sanghoon; Cho, Hye-Kyung",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF KNOWLEDGE AND LEARNING,,1741-1009,TPBWKJ8A,10.1504/IJKL.2016.079760,,2016-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-11T03:48:29Z,2021-02-11T03:48:29Z,,204-219,,"2-3, SI",11,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: WORLD TRADE CENTER BLDG, 29 ROUTE DE PRE-BOIS, CASE POSTALE 856, CH-1215 GENEVA, SWITZERLAND Publisher: INDERSCIENCE ENTERPRISES LTD Type: Article",,,,perspective taking; child-robot interactions; intimacy; robot learning; robot-mediated learning; role-playing robots,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web of Science,perspective taking encourages cleaning task performance: a child-robot interaction,perspective taking encourages cleaning task performance a childrobot interaction
,,,,,,,,,,Examining young children's perception toward augmented reality-infused dramatic play,"Amid the increasing interest in applying augmented reality (AR) in educational settings, this study explores the design and enactment of an AR-infused robot system to enhance children's satisfaction and sensory engagement with dramatic play activities. In particular, we conducted an exploratory study to empirically examine children's perceptions toward the computer- and robot-mediated AR systems designed to make dramatic play activities interactive and participatory. A multi-disciplinary expert group consisting of early childhood education experts, preschool teachers, AR specialists, and robot engineers collaborated to develop a learning scenario and technological systems for dramatic play. The experiment was conducted in a kindergarten setting in Korea, with 81 children (aged 5-6 years old). The participants were placed either in the computer-mediated AR condition (n = 40) or the robot-mediated AR condition (n = 41). We administered an instrument to measure children's perceived levels of the following variables: (a) satisfaction (i.e., interest in dramatic play & user-friendliness), (b) sensory immersion (i.e., self-engagement, environment-engagement & interaction-engagement), and (c) media recognition (i.e., collaboration with media, media function & empathy with media). Data analysis indicates that children in the robot-mediated condition showed significantly higher perceptions than those in the computer-mediated condition regarding the following aspects: interest in dramatic play (satisfaction), interactive engagement (sensory immersion), and empathy with media (media recognition). Furthermore, it was found that the younger-aged children and girls, in particular, perceived AR-infused dramatic play more positively than the older-aged children and boys, respectively. The contribution of this study is to provide empirical evidence about the affordances of robots and AR-based learning systems for young children. This remains a relatively unexplored area of research in the field of learning technologies.

It interprets the latter as precursors to a paradigmatic transition that could significantly change our social ecologies. This shift consists in abandoning the classical view of emotions as essentially individual states, and developing a relational view of emotions, which, as we argue, can create genuinely new emotional and empathic processes-dynamics of “human-robot” affective coordination supporting the development of mixed (human-robot) ecologies.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2015,"Damiano, Luisa; Dumouchel, Paul; Lehmann, Hagen",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ROBOTICS,,1875-4791,AD25GHKB,10.1007/s12369-014-0258-7,,2015-02-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-11T03:48:30Z,2021-02-11T03:48:30Z,,7-18,,1,7,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article",,,,Human-Robot Interaction; Affective coordination; Affective robotics; Artificial emotions and empathy; Naked vs. embodied mind; Synthetic methodology/Synthetic approach,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web of Science,towards human-robot affective co-evolution overcoming oppositions in constructing emotions and empathy,towards humanrobot affective coevolution overcoming oppositions in constructing emotions and empathy

On the one hand, we performed this study to assess the quality of the current facial expressions of two robot heads. On the other hand, we aimed at developing a simple, easy-to-use methodological variation to evaluate facial expressions of robotic heads. Short movie clips of two different robot heads showing a happy, sad, surprised, and neutral facial expression were compiled into an online survey, to examine how people interpret these expressions. Additionally, we added a control condition with a human face showing the same four emotions. The results showed that the facial expressions could be recognized well for both heads. Even the blender emotion surprised was recognized, although it resulted in positive and negative connotations. These results underline the importance of the situational context to correctly interpret emotional facial expressions. Besides the expected finding that the human is perceived significantly more anthropomorphic and animate than both robot heads, the more human-like designed robot head was rated significantly higher with respect to anthropomorphism than the robot head using animal-like features. In terms of the validation procedure, we could provide evidence for a feasible two-step procedure. By assessing the participants' dispositional empathy with a questionnaire it can be ensured that they are in general able to decode facial expressions into the corresponding emotion.

First, it introduces into different notions of empathy and related capacities such as emotional contagion, affective empathy, cognitive empathy, and sympathy. Second, it presents a case in point of an intelligent tutoring system, Affective AutoTutor, whose affect-sensitive behavior seems to further and enhance the outcome of its interactions with its students. Affective AutoTutor appears to behave empathically within a well defined learning environment. Third, attention is directed towards the requirements to be met by artificial empathizers to be judged as empathizers tout court by their social interactants, even when acting in unspecified social situations. To be a convincing empathizer, the artificial agent would not only need to grasp the emotional states of its interaction partners and understand their situation with respect to an adequate world model, but also communicate its own affective states.

,,,,,,,,,,Towards Artificial Empathy How Can Artificial Empathy Follow the Developmental Pathway of Natural Empathy?,"The design of artificial empathy is one of the most essential issues in social robotics. This is because empathic interactions with ordinary people are needed to introduce robots into our society. Several attempts have been made for specific situations. However, such attempts have provided several limitations; thus, diminishing authenticity. The present article proposes “affective developmental robotics (hereafter, ADR),” which provides more authentic artificial empathy based on the concept of cognitive developmental robotics (hereafter, CDR). First, the evolution and development of empathy as revealed in neuroscience and biobehavioral studies are reviewed, moving from emotional contagion to envy and schadenfreude. These terms are then reconsidered from the ADR/CDR viewpoint, particularly along the developmental trajectory of self-other cognition. Next, a conceptual model of artificial empathy is proposed based on an ADR/CDR viewpoint and discussed with respect to several existing studies.

What exactly is empathy, and why do most humans have it? We present a model which suggests that empathy is an emergent behavior with four main elements: a mirror neuron system, somatosensory cortices, an insula, and infant-directed “baby talk” or motherese. To test our hypothesis, we implemented a robot called MEI (multimodal emotional intelligence) with these functions, and allowed it to interact with human caregivers using comfort and approval motherese, the first kinds of vocalizations heard by infants at 3 and 6 months of age. The robot synchronized in real-time to the humans through voice and movement dynamics, while training statistical models associated with its low level gut feeling (”flourishing” or “distress”, based on battery or temperature). Experiments show that the post-interaction robot associates novel happy voices with physical flourishing 90 % of the time, sad voices with distress 84 % of the time. Our results also show that a robot trained with infant-directed “attention bids” can recognize adult fear voices. Importantly, this is the first emotion system to recognize adult emotional voices after training only with motherese, suggesting that this specific parental behavior may help build emotional intelligence.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2015,"Lim, Angelica; Okuno, Hiroshi G.",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ROBOTICS,,1875-4791,QQRA5N8U,10.1007/s12369-014-0262-y,,2015-02-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-11T03:48:31Z,2021-02-11T03:48:31Z,,35-49,,1,7,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article",,,,Developmental robotics; Emotional contagion based on SIRE model; MEI robot; Robot empathy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web of Science,"a recipe for empathy integrating the mirror system, insula, somatosensory cortex and motherese",a recipe for empathy integrating the mirror system insula somatosensory cortex and motherese

,,,,,,,,,,An Experimental Study on Emotional Reactions Towards a Robot,"Although robots are starting to enter into our professional and private lives, little is known about the emotional effects which robots elicit. However, insights into this topic are an important prerequisite when discussing, for example, ethical issues regarding the question of what role we (want to) allow robots to play in our lives. In line with the Media Equation, humans may react towards robots as they do towards humans, making it all the more important to carefully investigate the preconditions and consequences of contact with robots. Based on assumptions on the socialness of reactions towards robots and anecdotal evidence of emotional attachments to robots (e. g. Klamer and BenAllouch in Trappl R. (ed.), Proceedings of EMCSR 2010, Vienna, 2010; Klamer and BenAllouch in Proceedings of the 27th International Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI-2010), Atlanta, GA. ACM, New York, 2010; Kramer et al. in Appl. Artif. Intell. 25(6): 474-502, 2011), we conducted a study that provides further insights into the question of whether humans show emotional reactions towards Ugobe's Pleo, which is shown in different situations. We used a 2 x 2 design with one between-subjects factor “prior interaction with the robot” (never seen the robot before vs. 10-minute interaction with the robot) and a within-subject factor “type of video” (friendly interaction video vs. torture video). Following a multi-method approach, we assessed participants' physiological arousal and self-reported emotions as well as their general evaluation of the videos and the robot. In line with our hypotheses, participants showed increased physiological arousal during the reception of the torture video as compared to the normal video. They also reported fewer positive and more negative feelings after the torture video and expressed empathic concern for the robot. It appears that the acquaintance with the robot does not play a role, as “prior interaction with the robot” showed no effect.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2013,"Rosenthal-von der Puetten, Astrid M.; Kraemer, Nicole C.; Hoffmann, Laura; Sobieraj, Sabrina; Eimler, Sabrina C.",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ROBOTICS,,1875-4791,DUK3XGEZ,10.1007/s12369-012-0173-8,,2013-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-11T03:48:35Z,2021-02-11T03:48:35Z,,17-34,,1,5,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article",,,,Empathy; Human-robot interaction; Experimental study; Emotional response; Psychophysiological measures,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web of Science,an experimental study on emotional reactions towards a robot,an experimental study on emotional reactions towards a robot
,,,,,,,,,,Infant and adult perceptions of possible and impossible body movements: An eye-tracking study,"This study investigated how infants perceive and interpret human body movement. We recorded the eye movements and pupil sizes of 9- and 12-month-old infants and of adults (N = 14 per group) as they observed animation clips of biomechanically possible and impossible arm movements performed by a human and by a humanoid robot. Both 12-month-old infants and adults spent more time looking at the elbows during impossible compared with possible arm movements, irrespective of the appearance of the actor. These results suggest that by 12 months of age, infants recognize biomechanical constraints on how arms move, and they extend this knowledge to humanoid robots. Adults exhibited more pupil dilation in response to the human's impossible arm movements compared with the possible ones, but 9- and 12-month-old infants showed no differential pupil dilation to the same actions. This finding suggests that the processing of human body movements might still be immature in 12-month-olds, as they did not show an emotional response to biomechanically impossible body movements. We discuss these findings in relation to the hypothesis that perception of others' body movements relies upon the infant's own sensorimotor experience. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

,,,,,,,,,,Effectiveness of an Empathic Chatbot in Combating Adverse Effects of Social Exclusion on Mood,"From past research it is well known that social exclusion has detrimental consequences for mental health. To deal with these adverse effects, socially excluded individuals frequently turn to other humans for emotional support. While chatbots can elicit social and emotional responses on the part of the human interlocutor, their effectiveness in the context of social exclusion has not been investigated. In the present study, we examined whether an empathic chatbot can serve as a buffer against the adverse effects of social ostracism. After experiencing exclusion on social media, participants were randomly assigned to either talk with an empathetic chatbot about it (e.g., “I'm sorry that this happened to you”) or a control condition where their responses were merely acknowledged (e.g., “Thank you for your feedback”). Replicating previous research, results revealed that experiences of social exclusion dampened the mood of participants.

,,,,,,,,,,Gender differences in cortical morphological networks,"Cortical morphological networks (CMN), where each network models the relationship in morphology between different cortical brain regions quantified using a specific measurement (e.g., cortical thickness), have not been investigated with respect to gender differences in the human brain. Cortical processes are expected to involve complex interactions between different brain regions, univariate methods thus might overlook informative gender markers. Hence, by leveraging machine learning techniques with the potential to highlight multivariate interacting effects, we found that the most discriminative CMN connections between males and females were derived from the left hemisphere using the mean sulcal depth as measurement. However, for both left and right hemispheres, the first most discriminative morphological connection revealed across all cortical attributes involved (entorhinal cortex <-> caudal anterior cingulate cortex) and (entorhinal cortex <-> transverse temporal cortex) respectively, which gives us new insights into behavioral gender differences from an omics perspective and might explain why males and females learn differently.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2020,"Nebli, Ahmed; Rekik, Islem",BRAIN IMAGING AND BEHAVIOR,,1931-7557,GBRTA2JT,10.1007/s11682-019-00123-6,,2020-10-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-11T04:02:13Z,2021-02-11T04:02:13Z,,1831-1839,,5,14,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article",,,,Gender differences; Brain connectivity; Cortical morphological networks; Cortical morphology; Feature selection; Sulcal depth; T1-weighted MRI,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web of Science,gender differences in cortical morphological networks,gender differences in cortical morphological networks

They have difficulty in understanding other feelings and their own emotions. This leads to the sudden emotional outburst and aggressive behavior in these children. Parents, caretakers and doctors find it very difficult to prevent such extreme behaviors. Learning the positive and negative valence leads in determining the early indications before the onset of emotional outbursts in children with ASD. The present study measures the psycho physiological electrocardiogram (ECG) signal from the typically developed (TD) children and children with ASD in the age group of 5-11 years. Personalized protocol was developed for every child with ASD to induce positive and negative valence and ECG data was collected using wearable Shimmer ECG device. The heart rate variability (HRV) and the QRS amplitude were derived from ECG signal using Pan-Tompkins algorithm and eleven features were extracted using DWT (db2, db4 and db8) mother wavelet. The significant features of ECG, HRV and QRS amplitude were classified using the K nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM) and ensemble classifier. Ensemble and KNN classifier achieved maximum accuracy of 81% and 76.2% for children with ASD and Ensemble and SVM classifiers obtained maximum accuracy of 87.4% and 83.8% for TD children using HRV data.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,,"Bagirathan, Anandhi; Selvaraj, Jerritta; Gurusamy, Anusuya; Das, Himangshu",JOURNAL OF AMBIENT IN℡LIGENCE AND HUMANIZED COMPUTING,,1868-5137,TI4E9JFL,10.1007/s12652-020-01985-1,,2010-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-11T04:02:15Z,2021-02-11T04:02:15Z,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY Publisher: SPRINGER HEIDELBERG Type: Article; Early Access",,,,Autism spectrum disorder (ASD); Heart rate variability (HRV); K nearest neighbor (KNN); Pan-Tompkins algorithm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web of Science,recognition of positive and negative valence states in children with autism spectrum disorder (asd) using discrete wavelet transform (dwt) analysis of electrocardiogram signals (ecg),recognition of positive and negative valence states in children with autism spectrum disorder asd using discrete wavelet transform dwt analysis of electrocardiogram signals ecg

Digital dentistry requires managing expectations pragmatically and ensuring transparency for all stakeholders: patients, healthcare providers, university and research institutions, the medtech industry, insurance, public media, and state policy. It should not be claimed or implied that digital smart data technologies will replace humans providing dental expertise and the capacity for patient empathy. The dental team that controls digital applications remains the key and will continue to play the central role in treating patients.

,,,,,,,,,,Decoding fairness motivations from multivariate brain activity patterns,"A preference for fairness may originate from prosocial or strategic motivations: we may wish to improve others' well-being or avoid the repercussions of selfish behavior. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to identify neural patterns that dissociate these two motivations. Participants played both the ultimatum and dictator game (UG-DG) as proposers. Because responders can reject the offer in the UG, but not the DG, offers and neural patterns between the games should differ for strategic players but not prosocial players. Using multivariate pattern analysis, we found that the decoding accuracy of neural patterns associated with UG and DG decisions correlated significantly with differences in offers between games in regions associated with theory of mind (ToM), such as the temporoparietal junction, and cognitive control, such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and inferior frontal cortex. We conclude that individual differences in prosocial behavior may be driven by variations in the degree to which self-control and ToM processes are engaged during decision-making such that the extent to which these processes are engaged is indicative of either selfish or prosocial motivations.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2019,"Speer, Sebastian P.

,,,,,,,,,,"Media, technology and the question about human benumbedness","It is no exaggeration to claim that we live in a time that is dominated by the media as part of the more encompassing hegemony of technology What is less widely known, and understood, is that peoples lives are to a very large extent “mediated” by away of living that is pervasively technology-oriented - in other words, where earlier ages experienced the social and natural reality without some or other technical device interposed between themselves and the world, the vast majority of people today relate to the world around them by means of such technical devices. Moreover, the latter are not “innocent” or neutral, but predispose their users to specific kinds of experiences, as well as to the widespread belief that society can be technically controlled A brief discussion is devoted to Gil Germain's contention, that in the current technologically oriented dispensation humans have forgotten what it means to be “desiring” beings, and that the social ideal of technological control has reduced human “desire” - the character of being “open” to the world - to mere, technically satisfiable “need”. Under such circumstances technology mediates human experience of the world The very fact that the American president can (and does), frequently cause an uproar in American society and beyond by means of timely and untimely “tweets” - that is, by using the social internet site, Twitter - is symptomatic of this state of affairs, as well as of the fact that we live in the era of what Manuel Castells calls the “network society”. According to Castells this novel societal configuration has been made possible by the technological revolution stretching back to the invention of the radio, which led to the advent of television and multi-media, and culminated in the development of the internet. Significantly, this global technological revolution has fundamentally altered the experience of time and space, with the consequence that the traditional experience of space as “place”, and time as sequential, has made way for the newly dominant modes of spatial and temporal experience, namely as “the space of flows” and “timeless time”. The reconstruction of Castells `s conception of the structural dynamics of contemporary, society in broad terms, as fundamentally technologically generated, sets the scene for the more specifically focused discussion that follows, beginning with Sherry Turkle's analysis of the effects of technology on human behaviour. What Turkle's recent work brings to light is that, although many people aspire to the status of (what is known as) “digital natives”, this does not come without a significant cost, namely a certain deterioration in affective and intellectual functioning. Despite her initial optimism about the gains of electronic technology, particularly the internet, in the social domain, her more recent work has therefore shifted to a distinctly critical approach to the relationship between people (particularly children) and technology. Not only has the use of smartphones and electronic tablets given rise to the phenomenon of being “alone together” with one's device, and concomitantly, to keeping people at arm's length in social reality (with to-be-expected negative consequences for one k ability and willingness to negotiate complex human relationships), but the attachment of particularly young children to their smartphones has had the demonstrable effect of eroding their capacity for empathy with others, as well as more generally their ability to communicate with their peers in concrete social space. Furthermore, “ doing things” on the internet has given people the wrong impression regarding the overcoming of political problems, which often require concrete social interaction and painstaking negotiation - something that people sometimes learn anew with a shock, when their “internet activism” comes to nothing. Another critical theorist concerning technology, Bernard Stiegler, radicalises Turkle k thinking by offering a critique of technology as being, on the one hand, a source of enslavement and of the “stupidification” of people, while simultaneously being a means of “critical intenstfication”. In this respect, he argues, technology is a pharmakon - poison and cure at the same time. This means that technical devices such as smartphones inculcate an over-dependence on them in users, simultaneously - as external memory-machines - robbing them of their capacity for memory and thinking. After all, the ability to manipulate a technical device cannot be equated with critical thinking, nor can the storing of information on a smartphone or a computer be regarded as being synonymous with exercising ones own memory. On the other hand, however, Stiegler recognises the capacity of technical devices to give one access to archives of information, as well as to technically mediated experiences of the world that was not previously possible, and urges users to use technology for critical intellectual purposes, instead of being only at the receiving end of information regarding marketing and purchasing opportunities, disseminated via technical devices by capitalist agencies. He draws attention to the fact that schools have become the veritable battlegrounds where these agencies vie with teachers for the attention of students, in the process interfering with the development of their critical intellectual ability for the sake of capturing their attention for purposes of marketing. The paper concludes with a brief elaboration on some ways in which Stiegler's and Turkle's dire diagnoses may be countered with practices that give reason for hope.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2018,"Olivier, Bert",TYDSKRIF VIR GEESTESWETENSKAPPE,,0041-4751,6P44I9PG,10.17159/2224-7912/2018/v58n4-1a2,,2018-12-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-11T04:02:21Z,2021-02-11T04:02:21Z,,634-649,,"4, 1",58,,,,,,,,,,Afrikaans,,,,,,,"Place: P.

Despite a surge of interest in examining behavioral characteristics of narcissism in the past decades, the neurobiological substrates underlying narcissism remain poorly understood. Here, we addressed this issue by applying a machine learning approach to decode trait narcissism from whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC). Resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) data were acquired for a large sample comprising 155 healthy adults, each of whom was assessed for trait narcissism. Using a linear prediction model, we examined the relationship between whole-brain RSFC and trait narcissism. We demonstrated that the machine-learning model was able to decode individual trait narcissism from RSFC across multiple neural systems, including functional connectivity between and within limbic and prefrontal systems as well as their connectivity with other networks. Key nodes that contributed to the prediction model included the amygdala, prefrontal and anterior cingulate regions that have been linked to trait narcissism. These findings remained robust using different validation procedures. Our findings thus demonstrate that RSFC among multiple neural systems predicts trait narcissism at the individual level.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2018,"Feng, Chunliang; Yuan, Jie; Geng, Haiyang; Gu, Ruolei; Zhou, Hui; Wu, Xia; Luo, Yuejia",HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING,,1065-9471,9VPCAEQP,10.1002/hbm.24205,,2018-09-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-11T04:02:22Z,2021-02-11T04:02:22Z,,3701-3712,,9,39,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article",,,,connectome-based predictive modeling; cross validation; narcissism; resting-state functional connectivity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web of Science,individualized prediction of trait narcissism from whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity,individualized prediction of trait narcissism from wholebrain restingstate functional connectivity

,,,,,,,,,,Age of gray matters: Neuroprediction of recidivism,"Age is one of the best predictors of antisocial behavior. Risk models of recidivism often combine chronological age with demographic, social and psychological features to aid in judicial decision-making. Here we use independent component analyses (ICA) and machine learning techniques to demonstrate the utility of using brain-based measures of cerebral aging to predict recidivism. First, we developed a brain-age model that predicts chronological age based on structural MRI data from incarcerated males (n = 1332). We then test the model's ability to predict recidivism in a new sample of offenders with longitudinal outcome data (n = 93). Consistent with hypotheses, inclusion of brain-age measures of the inferior frontal cortex and anterior-medial temporal lobes (i.e., amygdala) improved prediction models when compared with models using chronological age; and models that combined psychological, behavioral, and neuroimaging measures provided the most robust prediction of recidivism. These results verify the utility of brain measures in predicting future behavior, and suggest that brain-based data may more precisely account for important variation when compared with traditional proxy measures such as chronological age.

,,,,,,,,,,"On the Integrity of Functional Brain Networks in Schizophrenia, Parkinson's Disease, and Advanced Age: Evidence from Connectivity-Based Single-Subject Classification","Previous whole-brain functional connectivity studies achieved successful classifications of patients and healthy controls but only offered limited specificity as to affected brain systems. Here, we examined whether the connectivity patterns of functional systems affected in schizophrenia (SCZ), Parkinson's disease (PD), or normal aging equally translate into high classification accuracies for these conditions. We compared classification performance between pre-defined networks for each group and, for any given network, between groups. Separate support vector machine classifications of 86 SCZ patients, 80 PD patients, and 95 older adults relative to their matched healthy/young controls, respectively, were performed on functional connectivity in 12 task-based, meta-analytically defined networks using 25 replications of a nested 10-fold cross-validation scheme. Classification performance of the various networks clearly differed between conditions, as those networks that best classified one disease were usually non-informative for the other. For SCZ, but not PD, emotion-processing, empathy, and cognitive action control networks distinguished patients most accurately from controls. For PD, but not SCZ, networks subserving autobiographical or semantic memory, motor execution, and theory-of-mind cognition yielded the best classifications. In contrast, young-old classification was excellent based on all networks and outperformed both clinical classifications. Our pattern-classification approach captured associations between clinical and developmental conditions and functional network integrity with a higher level of specificity than did previous whole-brain analyses. Taken together, our results support resting-state connectivity as a marker of functional dysregulation in specific networks known to be affected by SCZ and PD, while suggesting that aging affects network integrity in a more global way.

,,,,,,,,,,Initial Progress Toward Development of a Voice-Based Computer-Delivered Motivational Intervention for Heavy Drinking College Students: An Experimental Study,"Background: Computer-delivered interventions have been shown to be effective in reducing alcohol consumption in heavy drinking college students. However, these computer-delivered interventions rely on mouse, keyboard, or touchscreen responses for interactions between the users and the computer-delivered intervention. The principles of motivational interviewing suggest that in-person interventions may be effective, in part, because they encourage individuals to think through and speak aloud their motivations for changing a health behavior, which current computer-delivered interventions do not allow. Objective: The objective of this study was to take the initial steps toward development of a voice-based computer-delivered intervention that can ask open-ended questions and respond appropriately to users' verbal responses, more closely mirroring a human-delivered motivational intervention. Methods: We developed (1) a voice-based computer-delivered intervention that was run by a human controller and that allowed participants to speak their responses to scripted prompts delivered by speech generation software and (2) a text-based computer-delivered intervention that relied on the mouse, keyboard, and computer screen for all interactions. We randomized 60 heavy drinking college students to interact with the voice-based computer-delivered intervention and 30 to interact with the text-based computer-delivered intervention and compared their ratings of the systems as well as their motivation to change drinking and their drinking behavior at 1-month follow-up. Results: Participants reported that the voice-based computer-delivered intervention engaged positively with them in the session and delivered content in a manner consistent with motivational interviewing principles. At 1-month follow-up, participants in the voice-based computer-delivered intervention condition reported significant decreases in quantity, frequency, and problems associated with drinking, and increased perceived importance of changing drinking behaviors. In comparison to the text-based computer-delivered intervention condition, those assigned to voice-based computer-delivered intervention reported significantly fewer alcohol-related problems at the 1-month follow-up (incident rate ratio 0.60, 95% CI 0.44-0.83, P=.002). The conditions did not differ significantly on perceived importance of changing drinking or on measures of drinking quantity and frequency of heavy drinking. Conclusions: Results indicate that it is feasible to construct a series of open-ended questions and a bank of responses and follow-up prompts that can be used in a future fully automated voice-based computer-delivered intervention that may mirror more closely human-delivered motivational interventions to reduce drinking. Such efforts will require using advanced speech recognition capabilities and machine-learning approaches to train a program to mirror the decisions made by human controllers in the voice-based computer-delivered intervention used in this study.

This research attempts to model specific forms of intelligence through brute-force search heuristics and also reproduce features of human perception and cognition, including emotions. Such goals have implications for artificial consciousness, with some arguing that it will be achievable once we overcome short-term engineering challenges. We believe, however, that phenomenal consciousness cannot be implemented in machines. This becomes clear when considering emotions and examining the dissociation between consciousness and attention in humans. While we may be able to program ethical behavior based on rules and machine learning, we will never be able to reproduce emotions or empathy by programming such control systems these will be merely simulations. Arguments in favor of this claim include considerations about evolution, the neuropsychological aspects of emotions, and the dissociation between attention and consciousness found in humans. Ultimately, we are far from achieving artificial consciousness. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

,,,,,,,,,,Beyond Surface Knowledge: An Exploration of How Empathic Design Techniques Enhances Engineers Understanding of Users' Needs,"This study explores the role of empathic design techniques on solving design problems in a developing world context. In our study, over 100 graduate students were asked to individually conceptualize and design an extremely affordable washing machine to be used in developing countries. All participating students, many of whom had significant industry experience, were enrolled in a graduate-level product design course. This course is as much about design thinking and learning as it is about design innovation, creativity and doing design. The design of an artifact is addressed from a multidisciplinary perspective that includes determination through inspiration, ideation, and implementation using a design thinking framework. Student submissions were categorized based on (1) design methods such as concept generation, product definition, prototyping and design verification, and (2) student demographic information. The application of the design methods on the project influenced the further development of class-based exercises that infuse empathy into design. The study presented here also provides a framework for engaging distance-learning students within hands-on empathic-design exercises. The results show that techniques such as interviews of focus groups and immersive practices help students to better understand user needs in developing world contexts, leading to more feasible design solutions.

,,,,,,,,,,Developing compassionate leadership in health care: an integrative review,"Compassionate health care is universally valued as a social and moral good to be upheld and sustained. Leadership is considered pivotal for enabling the development and preservation of compassionate health care organizations. Strategies for developing compassionate health care leadership in the complex, fast-moving world of today will require a paradigm shift from the prevalent dehumanizing model of the organization as machine to one of the organizations as a living complex adaptive system. It will also require the abandonment of individualistic, heroic models of leadership to one of shared, distributive, and adaptive leadership. “Command and control” leadership, accompanied by stifling regulation, rigid prescriptions, coercive punishments, and/or extrinsic rewards, infuses fear into the system with consequent disempowerment and disunity within the workforce, and the attrition of innovation and compassion. It must be eschewed. Instead, leadership should be developed throughout the organization with collective holistic learning strategies combined with high levels of staff support and engagement. Culture and leadership are interdependent and synergistic; their codevelopment needs to be grounded in a sophisticated, scientifically based account of human nature held within a coherent philosophical framework reflected by modern organizational and leadership theories. Developing leadership for compassionate care requires acknowledging and making provision for the difficulties and challenges of working in an anxiety-laden context. This means providing appropriate training and well-being programs, sustaining high levels of trust and mutually supportive interpersonal connections, and fostering the sharing of knowledge, skills, and workload across silos. It requires enabling people to experiment without fear of reprisal, to reflect on their work, and to view errors as opportunities for learning and improvement.

,,,,,,,,,,"Goal-directed, habitual and Pavlovian prosocial behavior","Although prosocial behaviors have been widely studied across disciplines, the mechanisms underlying them are not fully understood. Evidence from psychology, biology and economics suggests that prosocial behaviors can be driven by a variety of seemingly opposing factors: altruism or egoism, intuition or deliberation, inborn instincts or learned dispositions, and utility derived from actions or their outcomes. Here we propose a framework inspired by research on reinforcement learning and decision making that links these processes and explains characteristics of prosocial behaviors in different contexts. More specifically, we suggest that prosocial behaviors inherit features of up to three decision-making systems employed to choose between self- and other-regarding acts: a goal directed system that selects actions based on their predicted consequences, a habitual system that selects actions based on their reinforcement history, and a Pavlovian system that emits reflexive responses based on evolutionarily prescribed priors. This framework, initially described in the field of cognitive neuroscience and machine learning, provides insight into the potential neural circuits and computations shaping prosocial behaviors. Furthermore, it identifies specific conditions in which each of these three systems should dominate and promote other- or self- regarding behavior.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2015,"Gesiarz, Filip; Crockett, Molly J.",FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE,,1662-5153,UCYYP4UX,10.3389/fnbeh.2015.00135,,2015-05-27T00:00:00Z,2021-02-11T04:02:30Z,2021-02-11T04:02:30Z,,,,,9,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND Publisher: FRONTIERS MEDIA SA Type: Article",,,,prosocial behavior; altruism; reinforcement learning; dictator game; model-based; model-free; Pavlovian; warm-glow,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web of Science,"goal-directed, habitual and pavlovian prosocial behavior",goaldirected habitual and pavlovian prosocial behavior

To date, the SP/SR framework research has generally focused on entire programmes and has rarely assessed the utility of specific exercises as teaching tools. This study aimed to determine the utility of an exposure intervention known as a shame attack in helping to facilitate CBT training in a clinical psychology programe when delivered in a SP/SR framework. It also sought to examine the potential for the exercise to be used as a form of competency-based assessment. Forty-one student trainees engaged in self-directed shame attack exercises and provided written reflections on their experiences. The reflections were then studied via thematic analysis. The results indicate that the exercise provides an avenue for competency-based assessment of trainee therapists' conceptual knowledge, formulation skills and intervention planning. It also promoted learning outcomes relating to a `deeper' and more nuanced appreciation of CBT theory and practice. The shame attack exercise provided for personal development and the opportunity to experience typical client challenges with engaging in exposure interventions, which have the potential for enhancing empathy and cognitive behavioural skills.

Together the therapist and patient creatively learn about each other so that the analyst can join the child's world in his own unique way. The analysis raises questions about the potential of psychoanalysis and the psychoanalyst's role for the autistic patient, who has his own vision of the outside world from within his particular inner world.

Intensive critical care nurses who nurse accidentally intoxicated patients face complex and demanding situations, and there is a lack of studies regarding this topic. Aims and objectives To illuminate Swedish intensive critical care nurses' experiences of nursing accidentally intoxicated patients after abuse of illicit drugs. Design A qualitative design with an inductive approach was used. Methods Semi-structured interviews were conducted with eight intensive critical care nurses at an intensive care unit in Sweden. Data were analysed using qualitative content analysis. Findings The themes found illuminate intensive critical care nurses' experiences of nursing accidentally intoxicated patients after their abuse of illicit drugs: feeling empathy and a wish to provide dignified care; dreading nursing the patient and feeling a lack of empathy; feeling frustration and questioning the care; lacking knowledge about a complex and challenging situation. Conclusions It is essential to respond to intoxicated patients with empathy and dignity. Intensive critical care nurses should learn how to identify factors that lead to provocation and agitation in order to reduce the occurrence of dangerous situations in intensive care units. Relevance to clinical practice To create a caring environment where the interaction becomes more positive and harmonious, an intensive care nurse needs a deep understanding of what a drug abuse disorder means. Moreover, the ability to see the person behind the abuse and to provide non-judgemental support is required. WHAT IS KNOWN ABOUT THIS TOPICWHAT THIS PAPER CONTRIBUTES Patients intoxicated after abuse of illicit drugs constitute a significant proportion of patients cared for in ICUs worldwide. Intensive critical nurses who nurse accidentally intoxicated patients face complex and demanding situations, and few studies have addressed this topic. It is essential to respond to intoxicated patients who are admitted to the ICU with empathy and dignity, as well as to learn how to identify factors that lead to provocation and agitation in order to reduce the occurrence of dangerous situations.

,,,,,,,,,,Interprofessional Improv: Using Theater Techniques to Teach Health Professions Students Empathy in Teams,"Problem Health professionals need to learn how to relate to one another to ensure high-quality patient care and to create collaborative and supportive teams in the clinical environment. One method for addressing both of these goals is teaching empathy during professional training to foster connection and commonality across differences. The authors describe a pilot improvisational theater (improv) course and present the preliminary outcomes showing its impact on interprofessional empathy. Approach In 2016-2017, the authors piloted a 15-hour course to teach interprofessional empathy to health professions students at the University of Wisconsin-Madison using improv techniques. The authors used a convergent mixed-methods design to evaluate the course's impact on interprofessional empathy. Students enrolled in the course (intervention group, n = 45) and a comparison group (n = 41) completed 2 validated empathy questionnaires (Interpersonal Reactivity Index [IRI], Consultative and Relational Empathy [CARE] measure) and a facial expression recognition task to measure empathy in the pre- and postintervention periods. Differences were examined using paired t tests. Semistructured interviews were conducted with 8 course participants to gain a deeper understanding of the course's effects. Outcomes The intervention group's mean scores on 5 CARE items improved significantly: ease, care, explain, help, and plan. On the IRI, personal distress levels decreased significantly in both the intervention and comparison groups. In the interviews, students who took the class reported a positive impact on their interprofessional relationships and on their ability to think on their feet. They also reported improv influenced other areas of their lives, including patient care and interactions with people outside their work life.

,,,,,,,,,,“Imagining a More Just World”: Interview with Julie Maldonado,"It is difficult to canonize anthropology and anthropological concepts, in part because of the creative tensions within the discipline's contradictions: a desire and deep respect for local knowledge with a global, comparative perspective, what might be called the “anthropological imagination.” Firmly rooted in-and in defense of-an inclusive vision of humanity, an anthropological imagination inspires “radical empathy.” It offers the scaffolding of a coalitional politics that values the specificity of local struggles but also reaffirms and defends humanity. We must identify the humanity in others, and the common humanity in their struggle, while affirming particular identities and challenging differential privilege: an anthropological imagination inspires radical empathy and solidarity, reminding us, in the words of the World Social Forum, that “another world is possible.” How people learn to cultivate this anthropological imagination and bring it in the service of marginalized groups is not generally discussed, and rarely taught. This article aims to bridge this gap. On October 10, 2018, Julie Maldonado, Associate Director for the Livelihoods Knowledge Exchange Network (LiKEN), discussed her new book,Seeking Justice in an Energy Sacrifice Zone: Standing on Vanishing Land in Coastal Louisiana, via video-conference with Mark Schuller's Anthropology and Contemporary World Problems class at Northern Illinois University.

,,,,,,,,,,Students' perceptions of interventions designed to foster empathy: An integrative review,"Objective: Empathy is assumed to be an important element of nursing care, and nursing educators are attempting to find ways to effectively foster empathy in their students. The purpose of this review is to gain a deeper grasp of what undergraduate nursing students are learning from interventions educators have designed to cultivate empathy by synthesizing qualitative data. Review methods: Utilizing the review methodology proposed by Whittemore and Knafl, a survey of the CINAHL, Web of Science, PubMed, and PsychINFO databases was undertaken to answer the question: What are undergraduate nursing students' perceptions of interventions designed to foster empathy? Results: A thematic synthesis of the students' perceptions from the 17 articles meeting inclusion criteria revealed five themes: Understanding the other's experience, embodying the other's experience, becoming aware of self, informing the role of the nurse, and learning or transforming. Conclusions: Although additional conceptual work remains to create a coherent, complete, and parsimonious definition of empathy, the results indicate that the students are gaining many of the facets assumed to be part of the concept of empathy through these educational interventions. Immersive simulations that put students in the role of the “other” were particularly impactful, especially if they created a disorienting dilemma followed by guided reflection. These findings can help nursing educators tailor their interventions for their specific intended learning outcomes.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2020,"Engbers, Ruth A.",NURSE EDUCATION TODAY,,0260-6917,7IP9GUUL,10.1016/j.nedt.2019.104325,,2020-03-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-11T04:12:05Z,2021-02-11T04:12:05Z,,,,,86,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: JOURNAL PRODUCTION DEPT, ROBERT STEVENSON HOUSE, 1-3 BAXTERS PLACE, LEITH WALK, EDINBURGH EH1 3AF, MIDLOTHIAN, SCOTLAND Publisher: CHURCHILL LIVINGSTONE Type: Review",,,,Education; Empathy; Simulation; Experiential learning; Qualitative,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web of Science,students' perceptions of interventions designed to foster empathy: an integrative review,students perceptions of interventions designed to foster empathy an integrative review
,,,,,,,,,,Positioning self-directed continuing learning skills in twenty-first century education,"Education must be recognised as an essential instrument in addressing the challenges within the twenty-first century, but it cannot exist in isolation or independently. Therefore, it is important to pay attention to the demands for education and training in support of the labour markets. The knowledge-oriented nature of work requires that all individuals must be literate, take responsibility for actions (learning) and learn how to think. High demands are set for the personal skills of individuals as they are responsible for their personal development as well as for establishing their quality of life. Individuals, therefore, need more knowledge and insight, a higher consciousness of the self and a greater ability to motivate the self. High demands are made towards the interpersonal skills of individuals, including, amongst others, empathy (orientation to service delivery) and social skills (communication, conflict management, team building skills, cooperation, initiating change). In the opinion of the authors, transformative and holistic continuing or lifelong self-directed learning is vital to addressing the gap between the knowledge and skills which learners acquire at school and the knowledge and skills which are relevant in the labour market and the twenty-first century. We argue, firstly, that transformative and holistic continuing self-directed learning with its purpose and function is essential for human functioning. Secondly, the connection between transformative and holistic continuing self-directed learning and success requires a change in ways of thinking (a mindshift). Thirdly, transformative and holistic continuing self-directed learning results in successful change in the individual learner. The fourth reason which the authors provide is that transformative and holistic continuing self-directed learning is essential to becoming successful in a labour market context. In addition, we believe that transformative and holistic continuing self-directed learning involves action learning, since individuals must learn while they are thinking about issues and working on real problems to implement real solutions. It can be seen as a systematic process that builds on the experiences, knowledge and skills of individuals, while individuals must also be encouraged to question learning content, which can lead to the creation of new knowledge. The information explosion requires the education system to move from a pervasive teacher-directed approach to a more learner-centred approach to prepare school learners for the labour market and the twenty-first century. The authors support the discourse that education institutions must deliver learners who will have a high degree of self-directedness in learning and become transformed lifelong self-directed individuals who do not merely focus on the product (market) but realise the value of the learning process. Education requires a paradigm shift that includes the relevance of alternative teaching-learning strategies and methods like SDL and problem solving in which learners are functionally immersed in deep thinking and occupied with their learning. The above statement is vital to creating citizens who can think independently, creatively solve problems and assume their positions as contributing citizens of the society. According to the authors, (life-long) SDL is of great importance in filling the gap between the knowledge and skills that learners must master at school on the one hand and the knowledge and skills that are relevant for the labour market and society of the twenty-first century on the other. Education in the twenty-first century should, therefore, be recognised as an important tool for dealing with the challenges of the 21st century, but it cannot be used in isolation (Knowles, Holton & Swanson 2015). Thus, this study indicates that it is essential that the skills that the twenty-first century societies and workplaces demand be developed in schools. In addition, the educational needs, general objectives in the Curriculum and Assessment Policy Statement of South Africa (CAPS), the twenty-first century skills and the skills needed for individuals to function amidst the fourth industrial revolution should be combined in an effort to contribute to (lifelong) SDL.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2019,"Du Toit-Brits, Charlene; Blignaut, Henry",TYDSKRIF VIR GEESTESWETENSKAPPE,,0041-4751,ZSSAY5LY,10.17159/2224-7912/2019/v59n4a4,,2019-12-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-11T04:12:06Z,2021-02-11T04:12:06Z,,512-529,,4,59,,,,,,,,,,Afrikaans,,,,,,,"Place: P.

,,,,,,,,,,Innovations in Teaching Adult Education Living History Museums and Transformative Learning in the University Classroom,"The difficult times in which we live require innovative, creative, and hopeful pedagogies of adult education. This article describes a nontraditional experiential, “empathy-invoking” approach to the teaching of a graduate course on the theory and research of adult learning. The approach begins with the building of a safe learning community, a familiar “knowledge curriculum,” and a structured syllabus with academic readings, small group discussions, student “theory-topractice” facilitation of learning activities, and an academic mid-term paper. Both the teacher and students design and lead learning activities which elaborate, “unpack,” and critique readings, and develop students' capacity for experiential, emotional, spiritual, arts-based, and bodily learning as well as group process, all the while reinforcing trust, deeper relationships, cooperation, and better knowledge of each others' lives, personalities, capabilities, and identities. The class culminates in creative presentations where learners transform the classroom into “living history museums” representing the sites of adult learning they have investigated in field research. Visitors to living history museums engage in a rich array of informal adult learning; they gain new knowledge, participate in hands-on learning and role playing, and at times even experience transformative learning.

,,,,,,,,,,"Attitudes and Habits of Highly Humanistic Surgeons: A Single-Institution, Mixed-Methods Study","Purpose Humanism in medicine is associated with increased patient satisfaction, trust of patients in their doctors, and better outcomes. The authors sought to identify attitudes, habits, and other factors that sustain humanism in academic surgical faculty, and compare these with attributes determined from a previous study of internal medicine faculty. Method A mixed-methods study design at University of Pennsylvania Health System was employed from 2016 to 2018 using a survey instrument and semistructured interviews. Surgical residents nominated faculty who exemplified humanism. In-depth interviews were then conducted with surgeons receiving the most nominations. The interviews were transcribed, and common themes were identified using the grounded theory method. These were compared with findings from a previous internal medicine study. Results Ten faculty described three strongly shared attitudes: humility, responsibility, and a desire to live up to a high standard of professional behavior. Five habits were found important to sustaining these attitudes and their practice: self-reflection, finding deep connections with patients, maintaining personal and professional relationships, “having fun” at work, and paying it forward to surgical trainees. Surgeons also cited the importance of past role models in developing humanistic attitudes and sustaining practice. Responses were compared with previously documented attitudes and habits of humanistic internal medicine faculty at the institution. Conclusions This study identified recurring attitudes and habits that characterize humanistic behaviors in a cohort of academic surgeons.

,,,,,,,,,,An analysis of autobiographical tools in written reflection: implications for teaching critical thinking and goal-setting,"This paper analyzes the results of an 18month study of a variety of participants involved in written reflection on their learning, both in classes at two universities in the Southern US or in voluntary focus groups. The purpose of the study was to analyze the effects of including autobiographical tools in written reflection. Participants used three tools from the genre of autobiography as they reflected on their learning inside either course content, internship experiences, experiential learning, or goal-setting. Over 500 samples were gathered, offering a large data set for analysis of what kinds of best practice produce quality reflective writing. Through analysis of the data and student surveys and interviews, results show increased attention to critical thinking and metacognition; expressed flexibility, adaptability, and ability to handle ambiguity; and value in connection to others/empathy-building as a result of incorporating autobiographical tools in reflective prompts. The study indicated that reflections using the same autobiographical tool over the course of several sessions seemed to produce deeper levels of reflection and more engagement with the autobiographical tool.

,,,,,,,,,,Demographic and spatial trends in diabetes-related virtual nursing examinations,"Diabetes currently affects nearly 30 million Americans, but the distribution of cases is not uniform across all demographics or every state. In the course of their education, nurses learn how to become important conduits for information on diabetes management during their eventual interactions with patients. Exploring the status and trends of diabetes-related knowledge in nursing students is one method to explore the idea that one's community affects how one sees disease. However, they are not yet experts, which places them in a period of transition. This study used data mined from the Shadow Health Digital Clinical Experience (TM) virtual patient exams conducted by nursing students between the years of 2012 and 2015 to find any potential demographic or spatial trends within simulation performance results from nursing students who examined a virtual patient with self-managed diabetes. Findings of the analysis indicated that age and experience affected the way in which an examination was conducted, where older and more experienced nursing students asked 8% fewer examination questions, yet showed 32% more empathy and offered 76% more educational statements than their younger counterparts. Spatial trends were less pronounced, although deeper analysis revealed that students in states closer to the national mean for population rate with diabetes perform better, show more empathy, and offer more educational statements during examinations compared to states well above or well below the national mean. This suggests that targeted information may be preferable to “one-sizefits-all” public health awareness and education programs for diabetes programs used uniformly across the country.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2019,"Schultze, Steven R.; Mujica, Frances C.; Kleinheksel, A.

While contrasting our different paths, we reflect and discuss our practices with/on empathy and place education. We discussed the power of bringing teacher education to places (and vice-versa).

To gain insights into pharmacy students' experiences in learning human anatomy using qualitative interviews and thematic analysis. Methods. Participants included Master of Pharmacy students at the end of their first year or the beginning of their second year. The study used a transcendental phenomenological design. Data were collected using semi-structured individual interviews that were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis was used to identify structural and textural components of participants' experiences using data management software. Results. Sixteen participants were recruited and interviewed. Students described developing an understanding of anatomy that differed from their previous experiences, focusing on variation in anatomical structures between patients, and developing professional attributes such as empathy and respect. Students described haptic learning that acted as a hook on which to anchor additional learning from textbooks and lectures. Finally, students perceived the experience as valuable to their future careers as caring professionals. Conclusion. The results of this qualitative study demonstrate that the value of teaching anatomy to undergraduate students goes beyond developing a broad knowledge of anatomical structures, but also engages a deeper conceptual appreciation of professionalism, thereby inducting them into a community of professional practice.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2019,"Rathbone, Adam; Nazar, Hamde; Harburn, Jonathan; Todd, Adam; Husband, Andrew K.",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL EDUCATION,,0002-9459,Y3ELMER4,,,2019-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-11T04:12:09Z,2021-02-11T04:12:09Z,,1782-1789,,8,83,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: 1426 PRINCE STREET, ALEXANDRIA, VA 22314-2815 USA Publisher: AMER ASSOC COLL PHARMACY Type: Article",,,,education; anatomy; pharmacy; professionalism; qualitative interviews,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web of Science,exploring undergraduate pharmacy student experiences of learning human anatomy using cadaveric specimens,exploring undergraduate pharmacy student experiences of learning human anatomy using cadaveric specimens

It considers pedagogical structure and phenomenological dimensions over an array of study abroad and immersive learning conditions. This paper illustrates rich and impactful ways that learning can unfold, including the unintended consequences of education that opens eyes, changes perspectives and builds empathy. Methodology This paper deploys a case study method whereby three unique programs for studio education are critically considered/analyzed. The research connects cases and delineates approaches in environmental design, whereby greater understanding and deeper knowledge can be attained. Findings This paper, through study of cases of immersive learning, reveals effective ways in which studio teaching can serve to heighten sensitivity, construct rich self/world views and render visible more profound knowledge. Such knowledge transcends disciplinary boundaries and professional borders - encompassing a fuller spectrum of awareness that includes the social, the cultural and the spiritual. Research limitations/implications This paper investigates studio-based graduate education in Environmental Design, with a particular focus on Architecture/Planning. As such, there are limitations to the applicability of discoveries and revelations. That said, the general model for teaching and learning may have value across disciplines well beyond those examined in the current research. Practical implications In an increasingly complex world, where cultures and values routinely collide, the research presents pedagogical approaches that promise to erode walls, dissolve barriers and counter fragmentation. The case studies illustrate effective ways to heighten learning beyond the ethos of traditional classes and conventional classrooms.

,,,,,,,,,,How does a drug court experience influence student pharmacists?,"Introduction: Drug court is a highly structured, community-based criminal justice alternative to imprisonment and probation that incorporates chemical dependency treatment for offenders with a substance abuse diagnosis. Drug court provides a unique learning experience for pharmacy students. Methods: Students from Purdue University College of Pharmacy and the University of Minnesota College of Pharmacy participated in drug court and provided written reflections regarding their experiences. Analysis of reflections explored how students' life experiences might be associated with their understanding of substance use disorder, and how the drug court experience might impact students' attitudes regarding substance use disorder as well as professional and personal development. Results: Consensual qualitative analysis of student pharmacist reflections of the drug court experience led to eleven distinct themes: description of the student experience at drug court; past experiences and exposures; past perceptions and judgments; stereotype deconstruction; empathy development; development of impartiality and fair-minded approach; situational appreciation; analytical thinking; role of the pharmacist; metacognition; and science of substance use disorder. Discussion: Colleges of pharmacy wishing to provide students with an opportunity for personal and professional development focused on substance use disorder and recovery should explore experiential learning opportunities in drug court settings. Conclusions: The drug court experience allows student pharmacist learners to gain a deeper personal understanding of substance use disorder while examining their own biases.

,,,,,,,,,,Forgiveness education in schools as a possible measure to prevent future social and emotional pain,"It was assumed for purposes of this article that many of the cases of people seeking counselling as a result of social and emotional pain due to social injustice inflicted upon them could have been prevented if they had been taught how to ask for and to extend forgiveness. (This of course does not imply that forgiveness education will remove all such social and emotional pain.) Children need to be taught how to deal with social injustices such as bullying, thereby saving them social and emotional pain later in their lives. Literature abounds with incidents that require forgiveness. The record of incidents underlines the need for incorporating forgiveness education in formal school programs. As far as could be established, forgiveness education has not yet been incorporated anywhere as a formal school subject. However, provision has been made in many education systems for its inclusion in, for instance, Citizenship Education and other formative subjects. In South Africa it could form part of the Life Orientation and Life Skills programs currently taught in schools. The purpose of this article is to provide school educators (teachers) with guidelines for teaching forgiveness education in schools, if (and when) it is incorporated in the formal curriculum. The rationale for including forgiveness education in the formal school curriculum can be explicated in terms of the social space and ethical function theory. Forgiveness and forgiveness education should occur in the social space resulting from the infliction of a social injury upon a person or group. Forgiveness education in turn should occur in the educational space provided by schools and other pedagogical settings. According to the principle of sovereignty in own sphere, schools are unique in that they embody pedagogical and didactical spaces. The school is firstly pedagogically focused upon the guiding, unfolding, nurturing, forming and developing of the learners to prepare them for a future as mature and responsible adults who understand the process of forgiveness. In this process, schools will secondly typically employ the didactical art and skill of teaching how and when to forgive. The theory also encapsulates the notion that the space in which forgiveness education is to occur should be ethical in that it displays and promotes love, patience and empathy, responsible and accountable interaction with the learners and a deeper understanding among learners as a caring community. According to this perspective, the school approaches forgiveness and forgiveness education as part of the moral development of the learners. Against the backdrop outlined above, the following is suggested as a “syllabus” or “subject curriculum” for forgiveness education: The first step of the forgiveness process to be taught is that a person should understand the context in which the apparent injustice has taken place. Children should be able to distinguish between a no-harm situation and one in which genuine injustice has been inflicted. Actions are always context-sensitive. This is the uncovering phase in which the person becomes aware of personal emotions and of the pain brought about by the actions of another. The second step is to gain insight into the function of anger, dissatisfaction and resentment. The forgiveness process begins with anger and resentment. It is important, however, to distinguish between productive, and sinful and senseless anger. Anger is productive if it helps one understand what has occurred, if one remains in charge of the anger, if the anger does not deteriorate into childish self-centredness, does not destroy the other person and if it helps one in choosing to forgive. The injured person should abjure all forms of reactive anger, that is anger that insists on revenge and retribution, and rather opt for transitional anger, i.e. forward-looking anger rooted in thoughts of well-being for both the injured and the injurer, in empathy for both the self and the other. The third step in the forgiveness process is to realise that the injustice or injury is of a permanent nature. The injury will never disappear and will never be forgotten, and therefore has to be dealt with. The fourth step is to realise that forgiveness begins with oneself and not with the injurer. To forgive is not a token of weakness; forgiveness is always granted from a position of strength because it ultimately results in healing of the self and the other. It liberates one from unhappiness and resentment and is an act of mercy to the self. It now becomes important to distinguish between two kinds of forgiveness: conditional and unconditional, and to realise that it is by far better to forgive unconditionally. The fifth step is an active decision to forgive, a step inspired by empathy for the perpetrator. To forgive is not just to forget or to pardon but rather to set the perpetrator and oneself free. An unforgiving attitude deprives one from opportunities of becoming what one could have been, namely a healed person. This is the decision-making phase in the forgiveness process. The sixth step is the workphase. The injured person invokes various cognitive and affective forgiveness strategies. One of the most important tasks in this phase is to reframe the perpetrator, in other words to attempt to view him or her in a more favourable light. Reframing ideally results in greater empathy with the injurer. The seventh step entails viewing forgiveness as a gift. It is only once one has forgiven the other that one is set free completely. The process ends with the outcome phase. The injured person begins reaping benefits from the process in the sense of beginning to grow spiritually after the dissipation of anger and the liberation from feelings of injustice. The way is now paved for a conflict- free future. The previously injured person can now become more pro-social, more morally responsible and develop a stronger sense of belonging. Enmity and alienation are replaced by a sense of peace. Empirical evidence has shown that people and groups who have successfully forgiven tend to display lower stress and anxiety levels, more positive relationships, gain more hope for the future and for life in general, and have a more positive view of the self. This is because they have successfully liberated themselves as well as the injurer from the burden of an unforgiving attitude. Only people who have been instructed in the process of forgiving during their formative years, who have been taught and as a result have learned what it means to forgive even the unforgiveable will be able to comply with the dictum of doing unto others what you would want them do unto you, able to care for their interests as if those interests were your own.

Amidst so much tension, we can still enjoy our profession if we can narrate the sequence in a different style. Poetry is one way of such expression. Poetry is a combination of knowledge and feeling. Just as we have all read Zachary Cope's Surgery in Verse which correlates the disease with its signs in a different way that is poetry, I have tried to use poetry in my medical practice, too. We can understand as well as express better. The whole topic seems so easy once it comes in the form of poetry. Writing in a poetic form requires a thorough knowledge of the subject. Added to this are empathy and sympathy. It needs a deep sense of understanding to feel what the sufferer would feel. Imagination can take us to any part of the world and beyond however minute the structure imagined may be.

,,,,,,,,,,Becoming Globally Competent Citizens: A Learning Journey of Two Classrooms in an Interconnected World,"Globally competent people are aware of world issues, take perspective, are engaged and know how to communicate to different people. This article portraits a story of two kindergarten classrooms, one in the United States and the other in Greece, both working with culturally diverse children and, in the case of the American classroom, English Language learners. The teachers shared philosophical foundations reflected in their practice and discourse in the classroom as they took a learning journey through Harvard Project Zero's Out of Eden Learn project. Out of Eden Learn serves as a platform to engage children from both settings in exploring their own neighborhoods, investigating contemporary global issues, and reflecting on how they as individuals fit into a broader geographical and historical context. Through meaningful hands-on experiences, the children in these two classrooms gained deep understandings of themselves and their surroundings, made personal connections and developed empathy as they heard stories of children around the world. In their learning journey, the two teachers used thinking routines to help the children slow down and observe the world around them. The experience not only helped the teachers comply with curriculum standards, but also allowed them to keep alive the children's capacity to be curious and promote parental involvement. The children developed a sense of self-understanding and self-identity as a point of reference to develop perspective and understanding of other cultures.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2018,"Salmon, Angela K.; Gangotena, Maria Victoria; Melliou, Kiriaki",EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION JOURNAL,,1082-3301,75HUEG54,10.1007/s10643-017-0860-z,,2018-05-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-11T04:12:12Z,2021-02-11T04:12:12Z,,301-312,,3,46,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article",,,,Culture and language; Empathy and resilience; Global competencies; Habits of mind; Slow looking; Thinking routines,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web of Science,becoming globally competent citizens: a learning journey of two classrooms in an interconnected world,becoming globally competent citizens a learning journey of two classrooms in an interconnected world

Negative attitudes and disrespect among healthcare workers has been identified by the homeless as a barrier to healthcare. A service learning experience with a vulnerable population has been shown to change nursing students' attitudes and beliefs. A large university in a southern city partnered with a community based organization that provided services to the homeless to educate senior nursing students in a service learning experience. The goal of this project was to examine attitudes and perceptions of nursing students toward the homeless population before and after participation in a service learning clinical practicum experience. This case study utilized a pre and post experience questionnaire to collect qualitative data for the purposes of the project. The findings revealed students demonstrated a decrease in fear, an increase in empathy, and a deeper understanding of the advocacy role of nurses for people experiencing homelessness.

Design/methodology/approach Through the implementation of the Leap Motion Controller in English classes of the first and third grades at the I.E.D. Tecnico Industrial de Tocancipa, the authors compared the appropriation of topics in groups that received the class in the traditional way and groups that were introduced to the Leap Motion Controller as a pedagogical tool. A statistical and comparative analysis was performed on the results obtained for each group. Findings It was concluded that the use of technological tools has a positive impact in terms of educational performance and learning, giving better results than traditional education; in addition, students showed great empathy with the AR tool. On the other hand, there were limitations to just having a Leap Motion Controller device, which prevented the student experience was even more didactic; based on this, for future research, factors such as the size of the population and the amount of available resources will be taken into account to achieve better results.

This paper explores the concept of critical reflection and considers how engaging with fiction may be an innovative pedagogical approach to support critical learning opportunities. Drawing upon interviews with fiction writers, ways in which critical reflection may be encouraged in connection to reading and writing fiction are taken up by exploring three different thematic areas that relate to a Habermasian framework of knowledge constitutive approaches to learning. These different areas can be categorised as (a) technical-rational, (b) humanistic and (c) critical or emancipatory. The first of these considers critical reflection as a way to develop technical capacities as a creative writer. The next section takes up a humanistic framework to explore the value of individual and collective learning opportunities to enhance personal growth and critical reflection. The third area of discussion considers a deeper critical or emancipatory framework of learning through critical reflection which may lead to social change. The paper concludes by considering the value of arts-informed adult education approaches, such as those related to fiction writing, to enhance the development of critical reflection amongst adult learners.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2018,"Gouthro, Patricia A.; Holloway, Susan M.",STUDIES IN CONTINUING EDUCATION,,0158-037X,BBBF9PKE,10.1080/0158037X.2017.1415875,,2018-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-11T04:12:14Z,2021-02-11T04:12:14Z,,133-148,,2,40,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: 2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND Publisher: ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD Type: Article",,,,writing; Critical reflection; fiction; imagination,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web of Science,learning to be critically reflective: exploring fiction writing and adult learning,learning to be critically reflective exploring fiction writing and adult learning

As a pathway, Service-learning provides value-oriented learning focused on inclusion, diversity, and difference. This paper adopts critical social theory to examine how, along with these values, critical Service-learning promotes a deeper comprehension of values such as empathy, civic responsibility, social justice, and equity. Our paper also studies how, along with values, enterprise skills develop when pre-service teachers adopt a self-responsible, decision-making approach to implementing inclusion, social justice, and equity. Fifty-one data sets from interviews, questionnaires, and reflection logs with two groups of students over two semesters were examined to comprehend the unique experiences of students as they navigated through values and enterprise skills.

,,,,,,,,,,Bullying incidences identification within an immersive environment using HD EEG-based analysis: A Swarm Decomposition and Deep Learning approach,"Bullying is an everlasting phenomenon and the first, yet difficult, step towards the solution is its detection. Conventional approaches for bullying incidence identification include questionnaires, conversations and psychological tests. Here, unlike the conventional approaches, two experiments are proposed that involve visual stimuli with cases of bullying- and non-bullying-related ones, set within a 2D (simple video preview) and a Virtual Reality (VR) (immersive video preview) context. In both experimental settings, brain activity is recorded using high density (HD) (256 channels) electroencephalogram (EEG), and analyzed to identify the bullying stimuli type (bullying/non-bullying) and context (2D/VR). The proposed classification analysis uses a convolutional neural network (CNN), applying deep learning on the oscillatory modes (OCMs) embedded within the raw HD EEG data. The extraction of OCMs from the HD EEG data is achieved with swarm decomposition (SWD), which efficiently accounts for the non-stationarity and noise contamination of the raw HD EEG data. Experimental results from 17 subjects indicate that the new SWD/CNN approach achieves high discrimination accuracy (AUC = 0.987 between bullying/non-bullying stimuli type; AUC = 0.975, between bullying/non-bullying stimuli type and 2D/VR context), paving the way for better understanding of how brain's responses could act as indicators of bullying experience within immersive environments.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2017,"Baltatzis, Vasileios; Bintsi, Kyriaki-Margarita; Apostolidis, Georgios K.; Hadjileontiadis, Leontios J.",SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,,2045-2322,3LZSKFAS,10.1038/s41598-017-17562-0,,2017-12-11T00:00:00Z,2021-02-11T04:12:17Z,2021-02-11T04:12:17Z,,,,,7,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND Publisher: NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP Type: Article",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web of Science,bullying incidences identification within an immersive environment using hd eeg-based analysis: a swarm decomposition and deep learning approach,bullying incidences identification within an immersive environment using hd eegbased analysis a swarm decomposition and deep learning approach
,,,,,,,,,,Mental Health and Old Age: A Qualitative Study in Iranian Population,"Introduction: Health, which usually declines with age, is one of the determinants of quality of life. Mental health disorder is one of the most common health-threatening problems of older age. Aim: The present qualitative study was conducted with the aim to identify factors that affect the mental health of elderly population. Materials and Methods: This study was a qualitative study with content analysis approach, conducted on the elderly Iranians in Tehran. Purposive sampling method was used to select 15 elderly Iranians. Semi-structured and in-depth interviews were carried out with 15 elderly Iranians in the parks and homes in 2015. To analyze the data, the content of interviews was typed and entered into MAXQDA software. This software was also used to code the data. The interview began with a main question about their experiences of everyday life, and then, exploratory questions to encourage the participants and access to deeper information were required. Results: Two themes of “interaction” and “worthiness”, 5 main categories (communication/relationship, empathy/compassion, entertainment/amusement, support and respect), and 15 subcategories (interpersonal communication, communication with others, communication with God, talking to people, being consulted, being employed, studying and learning, using the media, going to park, family support, social support, social respect, family respect, respect for personal space, and respect for beliefs) were extracted from the data. Conclusion: The results of this study encourage health-care providers to identify the factors that influence the sense of worthiness in elderly by keeping continuous contact with them and taking advantage of the unique opportunity they have to interact with them and influence their belief.

,,,,,,,,,,Self-Guided Web-Based Interventions: Scoping Review on User Needs and the Potential of Embodied Conversational Agents to Address Them,"Background: Web-based mental health interventions have evolved from innovative prototypes to evidence-based and clinically applied solutions for mental diseases such as depression and anxiety. Open-access, self-guided types of these solutions hold the promise of reaching and treating a large population at a reasonable cost. However, a considerable factor that currently hinders the effectiveness of these self-guided Web-based interventions is the high level of nonadherence. The absence of a human caregiver apparently has a negative effect on user adherence. It is unknown to what extent this human support can be handed over to the technology of the intervention to mitigate this negative effect. Objective: The first objective of this paper was to explore what is known in literature about what support a user needs to stay motivated and engaged in an electronic health (eHealth) intervention that requires repeated use. The second objective was to explore the current potential of embodied conversational agents (ECAs) to provide this support. Methods: This study reviews and interprets the available literature on (1) support within eHealth interventions that require repeated use and (2) the potential of ECAs by means of a scoping review. The rationale for choosing a scoping review is that the subject is broad, diverse, and largely unexplored. Themes for (1) and (2) were proposed based on grounded theory and mapped on each other to find relationships. Results: The results of the first part of this study suggest the presence of user needs that largely remain implicit and unaddressed. These support needs can be categorized as task-related support and emotion-related support. The results of the second part of this study suggest that ECAs are capable of engaging and motivating users of information technology applications in the domains of learning and behavioral change. Longitudinal studies must be conducted to determine under what circumstances ECAs can create and maintain a productive user relationship. Mapping the user needs on the ECAs' capabilities suggests that different kinds of ECAs may provide different solutions for improving the adherence levels. Conclusions: Autonomous ECAs that do not respond to a user's expressed emotion in real time but take on empathic roles may be sufficient to motivate users to some extent. It is unclear whether those types of ECAs are competent enough and create sufficient believability among users to address the user's deeper needs for support and empathy. Responsive ECAs may offer a better solution. However, at present, most of these ECAs have difficulties to assess a user's emotional state in real time during an open dialogue. By conducting future research with relationship theory-based ECAs, the added value of ECAs toward user needs can be better understood.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2017,"Scholten, Mark R.; Kelders, Saskia M.; Van Gemert-Pijnen, Julia E.

Method: Qualitative design and method were used to collect and analyze data retrieved from private interviews with seven graduate nursing students. Results: The themes were Being There, Think More, and Feeling Rushed. Students recommended the strategy as a measure of learning because it simulated a real patient encounter and made them think at a deeper level than other traditional approaches used to evaluating learning.

,,,,,,,,,,Medical students' reflections on emotions concerning breaking bad news,"Objectives: To gain a deeper understanding of fourth year medical students' reflections on emotions in the context of breaking bad news (BBN). Methods: During the years 2010-2012, students reflected on their emotions concerning BBN in a learning assignment at the end of the communications skills course. The students were asked to write a description of how they felt about a BBN case. The reflections were analysed using qualitative content analysis. Results: 351 students agreed to participate in the study. We recognized ten categories in students' reflections namely empathy, insecurity, anxiety, sadness, ambivalence, guilt, hope, frustration, gratefulness and emotional detachment. Most students expressed empathy, but there was a clear tension between feeling empathy and retaining professional distance by emotional detachment. Conclusions: Students experience strong and perplexing emotions during their studies, especially in challenging situations. A deeper understanding of students' emotions is valuable for supporting students' professional development and coping in their work in the future. Practice implications: Medical students need opportunities to reflect on emotional experiences during their education to find strategies for coping with them. Emotions should be actively discussed in studies where the issues of BBN are addressed. Teachers need education in attending emotional issues constructively. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

,,,,,,,,,,Holistic feedback approach with video and peer discussion under teacher supervision,"Background: High quality feedback is vital to learning in medical education but many students and teachers have expressed dissatisfaction on current feedback practices. Lack of teachers' insight into students' feedback requirements may be a key, which might be addressed by giving control to the students with student led feedback practices. The conceptual framework was built on three dimensions of learning theory by Illeris and Vygotsky's zone of proximal development and scaffolding. We introduced a feedback session with self-reflection and peer feedback in the form of open discussion on video-recorded student performances under teacher's guidance. The aims of this qualitative study were to explore students' perception on this holistic feedback approach and to investigate ways of maximising effective feedback and learning. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were used to gather data which were evaluated using a thematic analytical approach. The participants were third year medical students of Imperial College London on clinical placements at Hillingdon Hospital. Results: Video based self-reflection helped some students to identify mistakes in communication and technical skills of which they were unaware prior to the session. Those who were new to video feedback found their expected self-image different to that of their actual image on video, leading to some distress. However many also identified that mistakes were not unique to themselves through peer videos and learnt from both model performances and from each other's mistakes.

,,,,,,,,,,Living with “melanoma' ... for a day: a phenomenological analysis of medical students' simulated experiences,"Background Despite the rising incidence of melanoma, medical students have progressively fewer opportunities to encounter patients with this important condition. Curricula tend to attach the greatest value to intellectual forms of learning. However, compared with intellectual learning, experiential learning affords students deep insights about a condition. Doctors who experience ill health are more empathic towards patients. However, opportunities to learn about cancer experientially are limited. Temporary transfer tattoos can simulate the ill health associated with melanoma. We reasoned that if doctors who have been sick are more empathic temporarily `having' melanoma might have a similar effect. Objectives To explore the impact of wearing a melanoma tattoo on medical students' understanding of patienthood and attitudes towards patients with melanoma. Methods Ten fourth-year medical students were recruited to a simulation. They wore a melanoma tattoo for 24h and listened to a patient's account of receiving their diagnosis. Data were captured using audio diaries and face-to-face interviews, transcribed and analysed phenomenologically using the template analysis method. Results There were four themes: (i) melanoma simulation: opening up new experiences; (ii) drawing upon past experiences; (iii) a transformative introduction to patienthood; (iv) doctors in the making: seeing cancer patients in a new light. Conclusions By means of a novel simulation, medical students were introduced to lived experiences of having a melanoma. Such an inexpensive simulation can prompt students to reflect critically on the empathetic care of such patients in the future.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2017,"Corr, M.; Roulston, G.; King, N.; Dornan, T.; Blease, C.; Gormley, G.

,,,,,,,,,,"Market sense-making in design practice: exploring curiosity, creativity and courage","This paper introduces the three interrelated design catalysts of curiosity, creativity and courage, and explores how they actuate market sense-making activities in design practice. Drawing on the interplay between action and meaning dimensions in design practice and service-marketing theory, it specifically investigates when desirability, rather than feasibility or viability, is the locus of innovation activities. Thus, the following three aspects of market sense-making in design practice are identified: (a) curiosity catalyses empathy and the deep understanding of markets, which are seen as socially constructed of individual (value-in-use) and connected (value-in-context) experiences; (b) creativity catalyses logical leaps' with regard to understanding the opportunities for creating future markets; and (c) courage catalyses learning through iterations, which reduce cognitive bias with regard to market assumptions, thereby reducing cognitive bias in both curiosity- and creativity-driven activities.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2017,"Windahl, Charlotta",JOURNAL OF MARKETING MANAGEMENT,,0267-257X,NF4JJP5J,10.1080/0267257X.2016.1272306,,2017-03-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-11T04:12:19Z,2021-02-11T04:12:19Z,,280-291,,3-4,33,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: 2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND Publisher: ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD Type: Editorial Material",,,,creativity; courage; curiosity; Design practice; market innovation; SDL; service theory,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web of Science,"market sense-making in design practice: exploring curiosity, creativity and courage",market sensemaking in design practice exploring curiosity creativity and courage
,,,,,,,,,,Weighing the evidence: the BCISS Iraq HUMINT Analytic Matrix Exercise,"This article examines the Brunel Iraq HUMINT Matrix exercise. The purpose of this approach to intelligence pedagogy is to get participants to think through and work out analytic methods, issues, and potential solutions from first principles and for themselves. Our strategy is to try and fuse training and education learning outcomes, so that students emerge with a technical competence in analytic methods, underpinned by a deeper understanding of the foundations and internal logic shaping those methods. The Iraq Matrix exercise seeks to unpack and examine the nuts and bolts of source evaluation, and to test alternative hypotheses with particular attention to the relationship between the quality of various sources and, the weight of judgements they can or cannot sustain. The ultimate goal is to encourage what is currently fashionably referred to as `reflexive practice', whereby the practitioner reflects critically and self-critically upon how their task works and how they do it, then uses those insights to improve their workplace performance. But not all of our teaching is directed towards practitioners. For those whose aims are scholarly and academic, the aim is to give observers a more visceral understanding of the challenges of the intelligence task they intended to study. Here the intended reflexive practice goal is to encourage an empathy with the workaday challenges facing those in the business of intelligence analysis, and to discourage the observer's temptation to make facile and simplistic judgements about processes or events.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2017,"Davies, Philip H.

,,,,,,,,,,"REFLECTING ON THE HUMANITIES, RELATED TO EXPERIENCES OF ILLNESS, WITH A CREATIVE EXPLORATION OF METAPHORIC SPACES","Every patient has a story to tell, and every experienced physician has a bank of stories to recall. A patient's visit is not chance but a search for a cure, amelioration of state, advice, guidance, a prescription, or for seeking reassurance, comfort, and in some circumstances, permission to “be well”. From the simplest tale to the most complex, narratives abound. Sometimes, the most intimate information shared with the physician confidante, go dark and deep, with a yearning to “tell all” after a period of suppression. Successful communication and rapport also depends on the carer's response, the degree of concentration, listening skills, body language, eye contact engagement, the patient relationship and empathy. How do we as physicians cope with emotion on both sides when it comes to listening to a narrated story, keeping matters in perspective, recognizing the effects of depression, grieving, anger, forgiveness, or the strength of the patient to be able to face their demons when cowardly acts of abuse have been committed. The professionalism of doctors should always be at the highest level, but individuals vary in their responses. A price may be paid with arising stress, unsolved patient problems, an increase in new ones, and the general challenge of coping. Time may not be the only enemy with modern day medical practice.

,,,,,,,,,,The Way of Empathy in Moderation: Philosophical Dimension of “Expressing Passions”,"With the affirmation that “passions” is the nature of man; however, if the passions are not expressed appropriately, they can also be harmful to man as well. How to express passions appropriately is an issue worthy of discussion. This essay begins with the discussion and the analysis on why a person can be disturbed and hurt by passions when expressing them. Firstly, the essay is to clarify the word root of “passion”, including the relations among nature, passion, and desire as well as the principle of expressing passions by enumerating “what one dislikes/” and “refraining from doing it unto others/” as examples. Secondly, the essay is to talk about “the way of empathy in moderation” when expressing passions, a way which includes sincerity (be loyal to oneself) and faithfulness (be compassionate to others). Thirdly, the essay proposes the importance of “habit” in expressing passions: “knowing” and “thinking” is indispensible to one's acquisition of “habit” in learning “the way of empathy in moderation”; one has to “assimilate oneself into nature” and cultivates the habit of expressing “the way of empathy in moderation”. Finally, this essay is to affirm the viewpoint presented in “Nature Emerges from Life” in the Guodian Chu Slips, “One must temper passion with reason before expressing or receiving it, and then it should be seasoned with ritual.” This viewpoint provides us with a model of “passion to be stressed and to be well expressed” and with a humanistic value on the humanistic way of “passion deep and ritual clear”.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2017,"Su, Ying-Fen",UNIVERSITAS-MONTHLY REVIEW OF PHILOSOPHY AND CULTURE,,1015-8383,2PL4UAH5,,,2017-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-11T04:12:22Z,2021-02-11T04:12:22Z,,71-86,,1,44,,,,,,,,,,Chinese,,,,,,,"Place: 106 NO 96 LE-LI RD, DA AN DISTRICT, TAIPEI, 10668, TAIWAN Publisher: UNIVERSITAS Type: Article",,,,Expressing Passions; Faithfulness (Be Compassionate to Others); Habit; Sincerity (Be Loyal to Oneself); The Way of Empathy in Moderation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web of Science,the way of empathy in moderation: philosophical dimension of “expressing passions”,the way of empathy in moderation philosophical dimension of expressing passions

Students were subjected to in-course policies that gave preferential status and enhanced opportunities to some classmates while others were punished or handicapped. Each of the seemingly arbitrary conditions has parallels in U.S. legal, economic, and social systems. The experiment was designed to enhance student learning through an immersion in a simulated policy environment and to offer a personalized experience of dealing with unjust and arbitrary policies. Experimental and control group responses were analyzed with a grounded research approach.

,,,,,,,,,,Anxiolytic Treatment Impairs Helping Behavior in Rats,"Despite decades of research with humans, the biological mechanisms that motivate an individual to help others remain poorly understood. In order to investigate the roots of pro-sociality in mammals, we established the helping behavior test, a paradigm in which rats are faced with a conspecific trapped in a restrainer that can only be opened from the outside. Over the course of repeated test sessions, rats exposed to a trapped cagemate learn to open the door to the restrainer, thereby helping the trapped rat to escape (Ben-Ami Bartal et al., 2011). The discovery of this natural behavior provides a unique opportunity to probe the motivation of rodent helping behavior, leading to a deeper understanding of biological influences on human pro-sociality. To determine if an affective response motivates door-opening, rats receiving midazolam, a benzodiazepine anxiolytic, were tested in the helping behavior test. Midazolam-treated rats showed less helping behavior than saline-treated rats or rats receiving no injection. Yet, midazolam-treated rats opened a restrainer containing chocolate, highlighting the socially specific effects of the anxiolytic. To determine if midazolam interferes with helping through a sympatholytic effect, the peripherally restricted beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist nadolol was administered; nadolol did not interfere with helping. The corticosterone response of rats exposed to a trapped cagemate was measured and compared to the rats' subsequent helping behavior. Rats with the greatest corticosterone responses showed the least helping behavior and those with the smallest responses showed the most consistent helping at the shortest latency. These results are discussed in terms of their implications for the interaction between stress and pro-social behavior. Finally, we observed that door-opening appeared to be reinforcing. A novel analytical tool was designed to interrogate the pattern of door-opening for signs that a rat's behavior on one session influenced his behavior on the next session. Results suggest that helping a trapped rat has a greater motivational value than does chocolate. In sum, this series of experiments clearly demonstrates the fundamental role of affect in motivating pro-social behavior in rodents and the need for a helper to resonate with the affect of a victim.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2016,"Bartal, Inbal Ben-Ami; Shan, Haozhe; Molasky, Nora M.

,,,,,,,,,,Enhancing student perspectives of humanism in medicine: reflections from the Kalaupapa service learning project,"Background: Service learning is endorsed by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME) as an integral part of U.S. medical school curricula for future physicians. Service learning has been shown to help physicians in training rediscover the altruistic reasons for pursuing medicine and has the potential to enhance students' perspectives of humanism in medicine. The Kalaupapa service learning project is a unique collaboration between disadvantaged post-baccalaureate students with an underserved rural community. This study was conducted to determine whether the Kalaupapa service learning curricula enhanced student perspectives of humanism in medicine at an early stage of their medical training. Method: Program participants between 2008 and 2014 (n = 41) completed written reflections following the conclusion of the service learning project. Four prompts guided student responses. Reflections were thematically analyzed. Once all essays were read, team members compared their findings to condense or expand themes and assess levels of agreement. Results: Emerging themes of resilience and unity were prominent throughout the student reflections. Students expressed respect and empathy for the patients' struggles and strengths, as well as those of their peers. The experience also reinforced students' commitment to service, particularly to populations in rural and underserved communities. Students also gained a deeper understanding of the patient experience and also of themselves as future physicians. Conclusion: To identify and address underserved and rural patients' health care needs, training programs must prepare an altruistic health care workforce that embraces the humanistic element of medicine.

,,,,,,,,,,Developing and Evaluating Medical Humanities Problem-Based Learning Classes Facilitated by the Teaching Assistants Majored in the Liberal Arts A Longitudinal Crossover Study,"Although medical humanities courses taught by teachers from nonmedical backgrounds are not unusual now, few studies have compared the outcome of medical humanities courses facilitated by physicians to that by teaching assistants majored in the liberal arts. The objectives of this study were to (1) analyze the satisfaction of medical students with medical humanities problem-based learning (PBL) classes facilitated by nonmedical teaching assistants (TAF) majored in the liberal arts, and those facilitated by the attending physicians (APF) and (2) examine the satisfaction of medical students with clinical medicine-related and clinical medicine-unrelated medical humanities PBL classes. A total of 123 medical students, randomly assigned to 16 groups, participated in this study. There were 16 classes in the course: 8 of them were TAF classes; and the others were APF classes. Each week, each group rotated from 1 subject of the 16 subjects of PBL to another subject. All of the 16 groups went through all the 16 subjects in the 2013 spring semester. We examined the medical students' satisfaction with each class, based on a rating score collected after each class was completed, using a scale from 0 (the lowest satisfaction) to 100 (the highest satisfaction). We also conducted multivariate linear regression analysis to examine the association between the independent variables and the students' satisfaction. Medical students were more satisfied with the TAF (91.35 +/- 7.75) medical humanities PBL classes than APF (90.40 +/- 8.42) medical humanities PBL classes (P = 0.01). Moreover, medical students were more satisfied with the clinical medicine-unrelated topics (92.00 +/- 7.10) than the clinical medicine-related topics (90.36 +/- 7.99) in the medical humanities PBL course (P = 0.01). This medical humanities PBL course, including nonmedical subjects and topics, and nonmedical teaching assistants from the liberal arts as class facilitators, was satisfactory.

We examined whether information about other people's pain reports affected both participants' pain experience and skin conductance responses (SCR) during pain. Sixty volunteers experienced painful heat stimulation preceded by 2 kinds of informational cues: (a) nonreinforced social information indicating low or high pain ratings from previous participants; and (b) reinforced conditioned stimuli (CSlow, Cs-high). Both high-pain social information and CShigh cues enhanced pain and SCRs relative to their respective controls, with particularly robust effects of social information. Effects of both manipulations on both pain and SCRs were mediated by trial-by-trial pain expectancies.

By playing fairly, human and nonhuman animals learn to manage their social dynamics in a more relaxed and tolerant way that results in a more effective management of conflicts. We show that play promotes tolerance, cooperation, fairness and reciprocity, which are essential elements of the so-called positive peace.

The instruments are questionnaires on the systematizing and empathizing, questionnaires on the conceptions of learning science and questionnaires on the approaches to learning science. The data showed that the conception of learning science as taking tests was negatively correlated with the systemizing but not correlated with the empathizing. However, the conception of learning science as increasing knowledge and understanding was more positively correlated with the empathizing. The deep motive and strategy were more positively related with the systemizing than the empathizing, while the latter was more negatively correlated with the surface strategy. Our study suggests that while students with high systemizing are more motivated to learn science the ability to empathize is also important for successful science study.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2015,"Park, Jiyeon; Jeon, Dongryul",EURASIA JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION,,1305-8215,QJC7HA2D,,,2015-10-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-11T04:12:26Z,2021-02-11T04:12:26Z,,1141-1149,,5,11,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: GAZI UNIV, GAZI EGTIM FAKULTESI, K BLOK 210, TEKNIKOKULLAR, ANKARA, 06500, TURKEY Publisher: EURASIA Type: Article",,,,approaches to learning science; conceptions of learning science; empathizing brain type; systemizing brain type,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web of Science,correlation of students' brain types to their conceptions of learning science and approaches to learning science,correlation of students brain types to their conceptions of learning science and approaches to learning science
,,,,,,,,,,Mysteries of Hypnosis and the Self Are Revealed by the Psychology and Neuroscience of Empathy,"This article reviews a growing body of research and theory in hypnosis and neuroscience that supports the empathic involvement theory (EIT) of hypnosis (Wickramasekera II, 2001; Wickramasekera II & Szlyk, 2003; Wickramasekera II, 2007c). The EIT is a unified transpersonal theory of hypnosis and the self, which weaves together empathic elements of Dzogchen, neodissociative, neuroscience, psychoanalytic, sociocognitive, and other theories by proposing that hypnotic phenomena are inherently characterized by their deep involvement with processes of empathy and the self. The EIT proposes that the experience of hypnosis is embodied in a system of neural networks in the brain that utilizes empathy-related processes, adaptive resonance between perceptual input and top-down expectancies, and connectionist learning algorithms to (a) empathically enact the affect, cognition, body language, response expectancies, social roles, sensations, etc. that are presented to them during hypnosis in accordance with socio-cognitive theories of hypnosis; (b) engage in a convergent psychophysiological relationship with another person in accordance with psychoanalytic, Ericksonian, and polyvagal/social engagement system theories; (c) alter the empathic self/other (theory of mind) coding of phenomenological experiences during hypnosis in accordance with aspects of the neo-dissociative and socio-cognitive traditions; and (d) develop an experiential understanding of the illusion of self that may lead, in some people, to its transcendence in accordance with Bon-Buddhist, Dzogchen, and transpersonal scholars. A unified definition of hypnosis is proposed based on findings in the empathic neuroscience of hypnosis as well as a working model of the neuromatrix of the self.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2015,"Wickramasekera, Ian E., II",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL HYPNOSIS,,0002-9157,6225NMZW,10.1080/00029157.2014.978495,,2015-07-03T00:00:00Z,2021-02-11T04:12:27Z,2021-02-11T04:12:27Z,,330-348,,"3, SI",57,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: 2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND Publisher: ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD Type: Article",,,,self; empathy; neuroscience; consciousness; Dzogchen; hypnosis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web of Science,mysteries of hypnosis and the self are revealed by the psychology and neuroscience of empathy,mysteries of hypnosis and the self are revealed by the psychology and neuroscience of empathy
,,,,,,,,,,"PHILOSOPHY FOR CHILDREN, COMMUNITY OF INQUIRY, AND HUMAN RIGHTS EDUCATION","The Community of Inquiry (COI) is a unique discourse model that brings adults and children together in collaborative discussions of philosophical and ethical topics. The model deepens children's higher order cognitive skills as they address complex dilemmas. This paper examines the potential for COI to deepen children's moral and intellectual understanding through recursive discourse that encourages them to transcend traditional and cultural limitations, confront their own moral predispositions, and increase inter-cultural understanding. As children become familiar with normative values couched in ethical dialogue, they are immersed in ideals of reciprocity and empathy in ways that transcend narrow self-interest. The technique plays upon children's freedom of thought and freedom of conscience as they learn to express their views and to listen to the perspectives of others. COI is a functional practice enhancing a deep and practical education of character. Such dialogues can become effective vehicles for introducing children to discussions of human dignity and rights that also challenge traditional power relationships between adults and children. The uncritical assumption underlying such power differentials often contests the de facto rights and dignity of children. COI is a valuable tool for human rights education as it encourages children's sensitivity to the rights and dignities of others and, simultaneously, honors children's own rights and dignities as participating citizens in the global community.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2015,"Mizell, Karen",CHILDHOOD AND PHILOSOPHY,,2525-5061,FEJ53MEV,,,2015-12-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-11T04:12:27Z,2021-02-11T04:12:27Z,,319-328,,22,11,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: NEFI-CENTER PHILOSOPHICAL & CHILDHOOD STUDIES, RIO DE JANEIRO, 00000, BRAZIL Publisher: STATE UNIV RIO DE JANEIRO Type: Article",,,,Community of Inquiry; Ethnocentrism; Human Rights Education; Inter-cultural Education; Philosophy for Children,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web of Science,"philosophy for children, community of inquiry, and human rights education",philosophy for children community of inquiry and human rights education

This paper presents a cycle from a critically reflexive action research co-inquiry that explored the tensions and possibilities of nurses' reflecting during care-giving where poems emerged as data. These poems were inspired by reflections, observations, co-inquirers' stories and interviews. They formed part of a first-, second- and third-person co-inquiry. Applying Bourdieu's concepts of doxa, habitus and field to the poems revealed cultural aspects of nursing practice. The poems resonated with nurses' experiences producing deeper conversations and powerful reflexive co-inquiries about practice. The poems evoked suppressed emotions and empathy. I argue poems derived from practice are embodied knowledge and thus have a legitimate place in healthcare action research.

,,,,,,,,,,Effects of Literature on Empathy and Self-Reflection: A Theoretical-Empirical Framework,"Various scholars have made claims about literature's potential to evoke empathy and self-reflection, which would eventually lead to more pro-social behavior. But is it indeed the case that a seemingly idle pass-time activity like literary reading can do all that? And if so, how can we explain such an influence? Would the effects be particular to unique literary text qualities or to other aspects that literary texts share with other genres (e.g., narrativity)? Empirical research is necessary to answer these questions. This article presents an overview of empirical studies investigating the relationship between reading and empathy, and reading and self-reflection. We reveal those questions in the research that are not addressed as of yet, and synthesize the available approaches to literary effects. Based on theory as well as empirical work, a multi-factor model of literary reading is constructed. With regard to reading and empathy, the metaphor of the moral laboratory (cf. Hakemulder 2000) comes close to a concise summary of the research and theory. Being absorbed in a narrative can stimulate empathic imagination. Readers go along with the author/narrator in a (fictional) thought-experiment, imagining how it would be to be in the shoes of a particular character, with certain motives, under certain circumstances, meeting with certain events. That would explain why narrativity can result in a broadening of readers' consciousness, in particular so that it encompasses fellow human beings. Fictionality might stimulate readers to consider the narrative they read as a thought experiment, creating distance between them and the events, allowing them to experiment more freely with taking the position of a character different from themselves, also in moral respects. Literary features, like gaps and ambiguous characterization, may stimulate readers to make more mental inferences, thus training their theory of mind. However, apart from literature possibly being able to train basic cognitive ability, we have little indication for the importance of literary imagination over narrative or fictional imagination. Regarding self-reflection, while there is no convincing evidence that literary texts are generally more thought-provoking than non-literary texts (either narrative or expository), there is tentative indication for a relation between reading literary texts and self-reflection. However, as was the case for the studies on empathy, there is a lack of systematic comparisons between literary narratives and non-literary narratives. There are some suggestions regarding the processes that can lead to self-reflection. Empirical and theoretical work indicates that the combination of experiencing narrative and aesthetic emotions tends to trigger self-reflection. Personal and reading experience may influence narrative and aesthetic emotions. By proposing a multi-factor model of literary reading, we hope to give an impulse to current reader response research, which too often conflates narrativity, fictionality and literariness. The multi-factor model of literary reading contains (our simplified versions of) two theoretical positions within the field of reader response studies on underlying processes that lead to empathy and reflection: the idea of reading literature as a form of role-taking proposed by Oatley (e.g., 1994; 1999) and the idea of defamiliarization through deviating textual and narrative features proposed by Miall and Kuiken (1994; 1999). We argue that these positions are in fact complementary. While the role-taking concept seems most adequate to explain empathic responses, the defamiliarization concept seems most adequate in explaining reflective responses. The discussion of these two theoretical explanations leads to the construction of a theoretical framework (and model) that offers useful suggestions which texts could be considered to have which effects on empathy and reflection. In our multi-factor model of literary reading, an important addition to the previously mentioned theories is the concept “stillness”. We borrow this term from the Canadian author Yann Martel (2009), who suggests reading certain literary texts will help to stimulate self-contemplation (and appreciation for art), moments that are especially valuable in times that life seems to be racing by, and we are enveloped by work and a multitude of other activities. Other literary authors have proposed similar ideas. Stillness is related to, or overlaps with the more commonly used term “aesthetic distance”, an attitude of detachment, allowing for contemplation to take place (cf. Cupchik 2001). Stillness, we propose, allows a space in which slow thinking (Kahneman 2011) can take place. Stillness is not reflection itself, but a precondition for reflection. In our model, stillness is an empty space or time that is created as a result of reading processes: the slowing down of readers' perceptions of the fictional world, caused by defamiliarization. Our multi-factor model suggests that while role-taking can take place for all types of narratives, literary and fictional narratives may evoke the type of aesthetic distance (stillness) that leads to a suspension of judgment, adding to a stronger experience of role-taking and narrative empathy. In a time when the biggest bestsellers are about crime and erotic sadomasochism, the idea that reading literature can make us better human beings may seem farfetched. However, ever since Aristotle's Poetics (1987; orig. around 335 BCE), authors, critics, and academics have made claims concerning the ethical potential of narrative drama and poetic language (e.g., Althusser 1983; Booth 1988; Boyd 2009; Bronzwaer 1986; De Botton 1997; Habermas 1983; Hunt 2007; Nussbaum 1995; 1997; 2001; 2010; Pinker 2011; Sontag 2007; Van Peer 1995). The general claims are that reading literature may enhance self-knowledge, make people more aware of the plights of those suffering, and more willing to take action to help them. In recent years, the philosopher Martha Nussbaum has defended the ethical power of literature most ardently. Reading literature, she says, triggers a type of imagination that is “an essential ingredient of an ethical stance that asks us to concern ourselves with the good of other people whose lives are distant from our own” (1995, xvi). Through this “literary imagination”, readers learn to put themselves in the place of people they could not have known that intimately in any other way, thus deepening their understanding and compassion. As Nussbaum (2001, 2) further argues, literary texts can lead to the sort of “self-examination” that is crucial to ethical decision-making. Often this is reflection on the self, in relation to others. Knowing how we might respond to certain situations might help us understand how others would feel as well (cf. Johnson's 1993 conception of “moral imagination”, and extensive use of the term elsewhere, e.g., Beran 1998; Guroian 1996; Hutchison 2004). These are just a few of the reasons why empathy and self-reflection make an interesting couple to focus on when studying the effects of reading literary texts. To various scholars, the claims about the relevance of this duo and their relation with literary imagination are far-reaching rather than farfetched. Hunt (2007), for instance, proposes that fiction has contributed to a mindset that enabled people to think up a concept like human rights. Novels such as Rousseau's Julie (1761) and Richardson's Pamela (1740) stimulated readers, she says, to empathize across borders of class, sex, and nation. “As a consequence”, Hunt claims, “they came to see others - people they did not know personally - as like them, as having the same kinds of inner emotions. Without this learning process, `equality' could have no deep meaning and in particular no political consequence” (ibid., 40). She illustrates her statements with examples of responses of contemporary readers. Pinker (2011) takes this line of argument even further, suggesting that the spectacular increase in availability and consumption of narratives in our history might have caused an increase in empathic ability and, subsequently, a decline in violence. The relevance of literature's effect on self-reflection is maybe less self-evident, but that does not make the claims less sweeping. Among others, Althusser (1980), Habermas (1983), and Bronzwaer (1986) have argued that literature's polyvalence can lead us to reflect on our own norms, values, and prejudices, and that this would ultimately benefit society. Indeed, awareness of self and others may be key to our happiness, social success (Cooper/Sawaf 2003; Goleman 1995), and even productivity (Ibarra/Barbulescu 2010, see Bal/Veltkamp 2013). But is it indeed the case that a seemingly idle pass-time activity like literary reading can do all that? And if so, how can we explain such an influence? Would the effects be particular to unique literary text qualities or to other aspects that literary texts share with other genres (e.g., narrativity)? The purpose of this article is to construct a model for such effects of literary narratives. It will reveal those questions in the research that are not addressed as of yet, and will synthesize the available approaches to literary effects. In our attempt to construct an explanatory model for literary imagination, we first evaluate the empirical indications that reading literature affects empathy in its various forms (Section 2.1). We will see that it remains unclear how such effects come about, but that recent studies help us to make some significant progress in understanding the workings of literary imagination (Section 2.2). In Section 3 we will do the same for reflection. Finally, we will synthesize our findings in our explanatory model in Section 4. We will make use of earlier overviews (Hake-mulder 2000; Keen 2007; Kimmel 1970; Klemenz-Belgardt 1981; Mar/Oatley/ Djikic/Mullin 2011), adding other and more recent empirical work that will help us to build a synthetic framework for future research.

,,,,,,,,,,"Dialogue Across Differences of Position, Perspective, and Identity: Reflective Practice in/on a Student-Faculty Pedagogical Partnership Program","Background: Inspired by various conceptualizations of both cultural diversity and cross-role partnership, this discussion challenges the assumption that holds sway in many people's minds: Differences primarily divide us. The context for this argument is a program that pairs undergraduate students and faculty members in semester-long partnerships to explore and revise pedagogical practices. Purpose: The purpose of this article is to explore how dialogue across differences supported by a student-faculty partnership program can inspire greater openness to and appreciation of differences. The focus is on fostering deeper connection and empathy across student and faculty positions, perspectives, and cultural identities. Research Design: Through systematically documented reflective practice, I draw on audio-recorded conversations, mid-and end-of-semester feedback, and follow-up interviews with student and faculty participants in the program, as well as on my own reflective notes and less formal communication with participants, to identify the ways in which these faculty and students conceptualize differences as resources for learning. Findings: Through supporting the demanding work of communicating and collaborating across differences, this program makes it normative for differences to exist and for people in relationships to benefit from them. The student-faculty partnerships evoke deliberate consideration of differences in position, perspective, and identity within collaborative work, which, in turn, generate ongoing critical reflection with the promise of changing higher educational practices. Conclusions/Recommendations: Higher education needs to create more opportunities for students and faculty to engage in dialogue across various kinds of difference. Suggestions are offered for how to create structures and support within which faculty and students can forge new perspectives that allow them to draw on differences as a uniting rather than a dividing force.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2015,"Cook-Sather, Alison",TEACHERS COLLEGE RECORD,,0161-4681,3IS6A9EG,,,2015-02-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-11T04:12:28Z,2021-02-11T04:12:28Z,,,,2,117,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: 525 W 120TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10027 USA Publisher: TEACHERS COLL OF COLUMBIA UNIV Type: Article",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web of Science,"dialogue across differences of position, perspective, and identity: reflective practice in/on a student-faculty pedagogical partnership program",dialogue across differences of position perspective and identity reflective practice inon a studentfaculty pedagogical partnership program

,,,,,,,,,,Speaking up about oracy: the contribution of drama pedagogy to enhanced oral communication,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to consider the growing interest in oracy and to propose the pedagogy of process drama as an ideal model for the dialogic classroom. Design/methodology/approach - This paper takes the form of an explanatory case study where the author draws on a successful drama/oracy project in a primary school in Brisbane, Australia, to illustrate the connections between Alexander's five indicators of a dialogic classroom and the process drama in which the students participated. Findings - The application of this process drama as pedagogy for the teaching and learning of oracy has contributed positively to students' oral communication skills and intercultural awareness. In addition, parents provide positive feedback about student engagement in school and developing self-confidence because “they have something to say”. Research limitations/implications - There was no formal pre-post test for the oral communication skills on this study, instead the researchers developed a draft “oracy” checklist which deserves further interrogation and development. Practical implications - There are implications for the use of process drama as a means of creating and sustaining the dialogic classroom. Teacher professional development would be required to assist the planning and delivery of dramas that allow for the deep and complex learning evidenced in this study. Social implications - This is an ideal vehicle for assisting in the development of empathy, collaboration, emotional intelligence and intercultural understanding. Originality/value - This is an example of an extremely high-quality curriculum plan and implementation. The importance of engaging in implicit and explicit instruction of oral communication for the twenty-first century should not be underestimated.

Intervention: We investigated the long-term influence of a simulated patient-based teaching intervention, integrating learning objectives in communication skills and ethics into students' attitudes and concerns regarding truth-telling. We followed two cohorts of medical students from the preclinical third year to their clinical rotations (fifth year). Open-ended responses were analysed to explore medical students' reported difficulties in breaking bad news. Context: This intervention was implemented during the last preclinical year of a problem-based medical curriculum, in collaboration between the doctor-patient communication and ethics programs. Outcome: Over time, concerns such as empathy and truthfulness shifted from a personal to a relational focus. Whereas `truthfulness' was a concern for the content of the message, `truth-telling' included concerns on how information was communicated and how realistically it was received. Truth-telling required empathy, adaptation to the patient, and appropriate management of emotions, both for the patient's welfare and for a realistic understanding of the situation. Lessons learned: Our study confirms that an intervention confronting students with a realistic situation succeeds in making them more aware of the real issues of truth-telling. Medical students deepened their reflection over time, acquiring a deeper understanding of the relational dimension of values such as truth-telling, and honing their view of empathy.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2015,"Hurst, Samia A.; Baroffio, Anne; Ummel, Marinette; Burn, Carine Layat",MEDICAL EDUCATION ONLINE,,1087-2981,8W6DTKE3,10.3402/meo.v20.28133,,2015-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-11T04:12:29Z,2021-02-11T04:12:29Z,,,,,20,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: RIPVAGEN 7, JARFALLA, SE-175 64, SWEDEN Publisher: CO-ACTION PUBLISHING Type: Article",,,,communication skills; clinical education; ethics and humanities,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web of Science,helping medical students to acquire a deeper understanding of truth-telling,helping medical students to acquire a deeper understanding of truthtelling

,,,,,,,,,,An investigation of Korean children's prejudicial attitudes toward a national tragedy in Japan,"Prejudice against another nation or culture is often perceived as a major hindrance to world peace. This paper will report on the early emergence of such prejudices, identified in eight-year-old primary school children in Korea. The research, conducted in June 2012, investigated Korean children's reactions to the Japanese tsunami of 2011. A pedagogically embedded research methodology (PERM) was used, where the research initiative was embedded within the teaching and learning of a normal school lesson.

,,,,,,,,,,"The distress of voice-hearing: The use of simulation for awareness, understanding and communication skill development in undergraduate nursing education","Role-play scenarios are frequently used with undergraduate nursing students enrolled in mental health nursing subjects to simulate the experience of voice-hearing. However, role-play has limitations and typically does not involve those who hear voices. This collaborative project between mental health consumers who hear voices and nursing academics aimed to develop and assess simulated voice-hearing as an alternative learning tool that could provide a deeper understanding of the impact of voice-hearing, whilst enabling students to consider the communication skills required when interacting with voice-hearers. Simulated sounds and voices recorded by consumers on mp3 players were given to eighty final year nursing students undertaking a mental health elective. Students participated in various activities whilst listening to the simulations. Seventy-six (95%) students completed a written evaluation following the simulation, which assessed the benefits of the simulation and its implications for clinical practice. An analysis of the students' responses by an external evaluator indicated that there were three major learning outcomes: developing an understanding of voice-hearing, increasing students' awareness of its impact on functioning, and consideration of the communication skills necessary to engage with consumers who hear voices.

,,,,,,,,,,"Vocation and avocation: leisure activities correlate with professional engagement, but not burnout, in a cross-sectional survey of UK doctors","Background: Sir William Osler suggested in 1899 that avocations (leisure activities) in doctors are related to an increased sense of vocation (professional engagement) and a decreased level of burnout. This study evaluated those claims in a large group of doctors practicing in the UK while taking into account a wide range of background variables. Methods: A follow-up questionnaire was sent to 4,457 UK-qualified doctors who had been included in four previous studies of medical school selection and training, beginning in 1980, 1985, 1990 and 1989/1991. A total of 2,845 (63.8%) doctors returned the questionnaire. Questions particularly asked about work engagement, satisfaction with medicine as a career, and personal achievement (Vocation/engagement), stress, emotional exhaustion, and depersonalization (BurnedOut), and 29 different leisure activities (Avocation/Leisure), as well as questions on personality, empathy, work experience, and demography. Results: Doctors reporting more Avocation/Leisure activities tended to be women, to have older children, to be less surface-rational, more extravert, more open to experience, less agreeable, and to fantasize more. Doctors who were more BurnedOut tended to be men, to be more sleep-deprived, to report a greater workload and less choice and independence in their work, to have higher neuroticism, lower extraversion and lower agreeableness scores, and to have lower self-esteem. In contrast, doctors with a greater sense of Vocation/engagement, tended to see more patients, to have greater choice and independence at work, to have a deep approach to work, to have a more supportive-receptive work environment, to be more extravert and more conscientious, and to report greater self-esteem. Avocation/Leisure activities correlated significantly with Vocation/engagement, even after taking into account 25 background variables describing demography, work, and personality, whereas BurnedOut showed no significant correlation with Avocation/Leisure activities. Popular Culture and High Culture did not differ in their influence on Vocation/engagement, although there was a suggestion that Depersonalization was correlated with more interest in Popular Culture and less interest in High Culture. Conclusion: In this cross-sectional study there is evidence, even after taking into account a wide range of individual difference measures, that doctors with greater Avocation/Leisure activities also have a greater sense of Vocation/Engagement. In contrast, being BurnedOut did not relate to Avocation/Leisure activities (but did relate to many other measures). Osler was probably correct in recommending to doctors that, `While medicine is to be your vocation, or calling, see to it that you also have an avocation'.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2011,"McManus, I.

Dick “Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?” still retains the interest of the wide reading audience. The paper aims at elaborating upon the reasons for this lasting public enthusiasm which is claimed to relate not only to extremely successful film-versions of the book, but, even more so, to the highly topical message of the novel. In his antiutopian text, Philip K. Dick manages to put into focus the whole range of issues curraently associated with posthumanism. These are environmental problems caused by human activities, interplanet colonization escalating the conflicts of inclusion / exclusion, human / animal relations overlapping with the hybridization of natural and artificial, critical problems of future technological posthumanism manifesting themselves in highly problematic distinction between the humans and androids and in questioning the ontoethical status of the humans Philip K. Dick explores philosophical and social underpinnings of the catastrophic future which lies in wait for humanity and seems to strongly adhere to such humanistic values as empathy (the main touchstone to differentiate between humans and androids), self-reflection (the predominant feature of the protagonist Rick Deckard), search for identity and for meaning as the principal vectors of the human life, mercy for the mentally handicapped. Philip K. Dick's book can be viewed as one of the earliest caveats of the emerging trend to reconsider humanness in the sociocultural context of rapidly developing technology, various environmental threats, all kinds of hybridization and their ethical repercussions - and as such can be seen as truly prognostic, the most valuable part of it to be found in its ethical and social awareness and highly conscious refusal to suggest any final answer: essentially, the titled question seems eristically unanswerable.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2018,"Antsyferova, O.

,,,,,,,,,,Is it the real deal? Perception of virtual characters versus humans: an affective cognitive neuroscience perspective,"Recent developments in neuroimaging research support the increased use of naturalistic stimulus material such as film, avatars, or androids. These stimuli allow for a better understanding of how the brain processes information in complex situations while maintaining experimental control. While avatars and androids are well suited to study human cognition, they should not be equated to human stimuli. For example, the uncanny valley hypothesis theorizes that artificial agents with high human-likeness may evoke feelings of eeriness in the human observer. Here we review if, when, and how the perception of human-like avatars and androids differs from the perception of humans and consider how this influences their utilization as stimulus material in social and affective neuroimaging studies. First, we discuss how the appearance of virtual characters affects perception. When stimuli are morphed across categories from non-human to human, the most ambiguous stimuli, rather than the most human-like stimuli, show prolonged classification times and increased eeriness. Human-like to human stimuli show a positive linear relationship with familiarity. Secondly, we show that expressions of emotions in human-like avatars can be perceived similarly to human emotions, with corresponding behavioral, physiological and neuronal activations, with exception of physical dissimilarities. Subsequently, we consider if and when one perceives differences in action representation by artificial agents versus humans. Motor resonance and predictive coding models may account for empirical findings, such as an interference effect on action for observed human-like, natural moving characters. However, the expansion of these models to explain more complex behavior, such as empathy, still needs to be investigated in more detail. Finally, we broaden our outlook to social interaction, where virtual reality stimuli can be utilized to imitate complex social situations.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2015,"de Borst, Aline W.; de Gelder, Beatrice",FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY,,1664-1078,MCSDSAYT,10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00576,,2015-05-12T00:00:00Z,2021-02-11T04:13:22Z,2021-02-11T04:13:22Z,,,,,6,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND Publisher: FRONTIERS MEDIA SA Type: Review",,,,fMRI; virtual reality; social interaction; uncanny valley; action perception; emotion perception; naturalistic stimuli; virtual characters,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web of Science,is it the real deal? perception of virtual characters versus humans: an affective cognitive neuroscience perspective,is it the real deal perception of virtual characters versus humans an affective cognitive neuroscience perspective

,,,,,,,,,,How Does Embodying a Transgender Narrative Influence Social Bias? An Explorative Study in an Artistic Context,"Virtual reality (VR) protocols inducing illusory embodiment of avatars have shown a positive impact on participants' perception of outgroup members, in line with the idea that the simulation of another's sensorimotor states might underlie prosocial behavior. These studies, however, have been mostly confined to laboratory settings with student populations and the use of artificial avatars. In an interdisciplinary effort benefiting from the heterogeneous sample within a museum, we aimed at quantifying changes in interpersonal perception induced by embodying a transgender man narrating his life. We compared an artistic methodology mixing VR and elaborate sensorimotor stimulation to a more conventional primarily audiovisual VR experience. We tested how these affect embodiment and the perception of transgender men as measured by a brief implicit association test and a questionnaire. Neither significant difference in embodiment nor changes in implicit or explicit bias was found, the latter potentially due to the initially low bias in the group. We further assessed participants' illusory embodiment as a function of age, finding a negative correlation between these.

,,,,,,,,,,Virtual Embodiment Using 180 degrees Stereoscopic Video,"One of the most exciting possibilities of virtual reality is inducing in participants the illusion of owning a virtual body. This has become an established methodological paradigm allowing the study of the psychological and neural correlates of various scenarios that are impossible in the real world, such as gender or age switching. Thus far, full-body ownership illusions have been implemented by using real-time body tracking and avatars based on computer-generated imagery (CGI). We propose an alternative technique to induce perceived ownership over a (photorealistic) virtual body using 180 degrees stereoscopic video, synchronous touch, and narration. We describe the technical components of our novel technique and an example implementation as part of a science-art project that enables participants to experience virtual bodies of different ages, and present the results of an experimental evaluation study based on this experience. Consistent with previous virtual embodiment studies using CGI-based techniques, we found that participants accept a photorealistic virtual body as their own irrespective of its appearance as indicated by similar ratings of the strength of body ownership over a virtual body of a child versus an adult. We further show that our novel technique can alter participants' cognition in accordance with the characteristics of their virtual body. Specifically, young adult participants who were embodied in the virtual body of a child significantly overestimated the duration of the virtual reality experience compared to a control group who was embodied in a virtual body of their own age. This finding corresponds to chronological age differences in time estimations and extends previous research on virtual child embodiment. Overall, these findings provide initial evidence for the potential of our novel technique to create photorealistic embodiment experiences with comparable psychological effects as have been found using CGI-based techniques while reducing the costs and technical complexity in the production and application of virtual body ownership illusions.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2020,"Landau, Daniel H.; Hasler, Beatrice S.; Friedman, Doron",FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY,,1664-1078,2TF4K9BL,10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01229,,2020-07-07T00:00:00Z,2021-02-11T04:15:44Z,2021-02-11T04:15:44Z,,,,,11,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND Publisher: FRONTIERS MEDIA SA Type: Article",,,,cognition; virtual reality; virtual embodiment; 180 degrees video; body ownership illusion; self-transformation; time perception,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web of Science,virtual embodiment using 180 degrees stereoscopic video,virtual embodiment using 180 degrees stereoscopic video
,,,,,,,,,,Effects of (in)validation and plain versus technical language on the experience of experimentally induced pain: A computer controlled simulation paradigm,"Background and objectives: Amongst social contextual influences on pain, the manner in which pain and painful procedures are communicated to patients is considered an important contributor to the subjective experience of pain. Threatening information, e.g., by the use of technical language, is suggested to increase pain reports. Validation, or communicating understanding towards another person reporting personal experiences, is suggested to reduce pain. The current study examines effects of both information language (technical vs. plain language) and validation (validation vs. invalidation) on the subjective experience of experimentally induced pain. Methods: Pain-free participants (N = 132) were randomly assigned to one of four groups as formed by manipulations of validation and information language. After reading a description concerning the upcoming thermal stimulus formulated in technical or plain language, participants engaged in a computer controlled simulation (CCS; based on virtual reality technology). Participants received three thermal stimuli while interacting with an avatar who either validated or invalidated their experience during the CCS. Pain intensity and pain unpleasantness were assessed after each stimulus. Results: The validation manipulation showed to be effective, but the information language manipulation did not induce differential threat expectancies. Results show no effect of validation or information language on subjective pain reports. Limitations: Suboptimality of the information language manipulation and shortcomings of the CCS procedure might account for current findings. Conclusions: The study offers an interesting model for the further experimental study of isolated and combined effects of (social) contextual factors on pain.

,,,,,,,,,,Measuring Alliance Toward Embodied Virtual Therapists in the Era of Automated Treatments With the Virtual Therapist Alliance Scale (VTAS): Development and Psychometric Evaluation,"Background: Automated virtual reality exposure therapies (VRETs) are self-help treatments conducted by oneself and supported by a virtual therapist embodied visually and/or with audio feedback. This simulates many of the nonspecific relational elements and common factors present in face-to-face therapy and may be a means of improving adherence to and efficacy of self-guided treatments. However, little is known about alliance toward the virtual therapist, despite alliance being an important predictor of treatment outcome. Objective: In this study, we aimed to evaluate the first alliance instrument developed for use with embodied virtual therapists in an automated treatment format-the Virtual Therapist Alliance Scale (VTAS)-by (1) assessing its psychometric properties, (2) verifying the dimensionality of the scale, and (3) determining the predictive ability of the scale with treatment outcome. Methods: A psychometric evaluation and exploratory factor analysis of the VTAS was conducted using data from two samples of spider-fearful patients treated with VRET and the help of an embodied, voice-based virtual therapist (n=70). Multiple regression models and bivariate correlations were used to assess the VTAS relationship with treatment outcome, according to self-reported fear and convergence with presence and user-friendliness process measures. Results: The VTAS showed a sound two-factor solution composed of a primary factor covering task, goal, and copresence; adequate internal consistency; and good convergent validity, including moderate correlation (r= . 310, P=.01) with outcomes over follow-up. Conclusions: These preliminary results suggest that alliance toward a virtual therapist is a significant predictor of treatment outcome, favors the importance of a task-goal over bond-factor, and should be explored in studies with larger sample sizes and in additional forms of embodiment.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2020,"Miloff, Alexander; Carlbring, Per; Hamilton, William; Andersson, Gerhard; Reuterskiold, Lena; Lindner, Philip",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,,1438-8871,6QRFEC5J,10.2196/16660,,2020-03-24T00:00:00Z,2021-02-11T04:15:45Z,2021-02-11T04:15:45Z,,,,3,22,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: 130 QUEENS QUAY E, STE 1102, TORONTO, ON M5A 0P6, CANADA Publisher: JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC Type: Article",,,,empathy; virtual reality; embodiment; presence; avatar; alliance; automated treatment; exposure therapy; psychometric; usability; virtual coach; virtual therapist,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web of Science,measuring alliance toward embodied virtual therapists in the era of automated treatments with the virtual therapist alliance scale (vtas): development and psychometric evaluation,measuring alliance toward embodied virtual therapists in the era of automated treatments with the virtual therapist alliance scale vtas development and psychometric evaluation

However, brain responses to avatar and human faces have scarcely been studied to date. As such, it remains unclear whether dynamic facial expressions of avatars evoke different brain responses than dynamic facial expressions of humans. In this study, we designed anthropomorphic avatars animated with motion tracking and tested whether the human brain processes fearful and neutral expressions in human and avatar faces differently. Our fMRI results showed that fearful human expressions evoked stronger responses than fearful avatar expressions in the ventral anterior and posterior cingulate gyrus, the anterior insula, the anterior and posterior superior temporal sulcus, and the inferior frontal gyrus. Fearful expressions in human and avatar faces evoked similar responses in the amygdala. We did not find different responses to neutral human and avatar expressions. Our results highlight differences, but also similarities in the processing of fearful human expressions and fearful avatar expressions even if they are designed to be highly anthropomorphic and animated with motion tracking.

This study compared the perception of realism and pain level from different onset orders of AUs in avatars. Seven videos of facial expressions of pain were created with four different avatars (2 women): six sequential onsets combining the three sets of AUs and one synchronized onset. 45 healthy adults (22 women; aged 23.6 +/- 5.2 years) rated the realism of facial movements, and the level of intensity and unpleasantness of perceived pain. A more realistic expression was associated with the onset of O before or at the same time as N, a more intense expression was associated when B occurred last, and a higher level of unpleasantness was associated with the onset of N before B. Therefore, the sequence ONB yielded the highest ratings on both measures of realism and pain levels.

The present research aimed to investigate the impact of occupational stereotypes, evoked by attire, as well as posture on person perception. For this, computer animation was used to create avatars with different types of attire (nurse, military, casual) and posture (open, closed). In Study 1 (N=164), participants attributed significantly more empathy to avatars wearing a nurse versus a military uniform or casual outfit. When adding posture as an additional cue, Study 2 (N=312) showed that ratings of empathy and dominance were affected by both attire and posture. This effect was replicated in Study 3 (N=163) for female avatars, in the sense that open postures in nurses increased empathy ratings and decreased dominance ratings, which both in turn led to greater perceived competence. By contrast, for male avatars, posture did not affect attributions of competence directly. Rather, attire predicted perceived dominance directly, as well as through perceived empathy.

,,,,,,,,,,"Contagious yawning in virtual reality is affected by actual, but not simulated, social presence","Contagious yawning occurs in humans and a few other highly social animals following the detection of yawns in others, yet the factors influencing the propagation of this response remain largely unknown. Stemming from earlier laboratory research, we conducted five experiments to investigate the effects of social presence on contagious yawning in virtual reality (VR). We show that, similar to a traditional laboratory setting, having a researcher present during testing significantly inhibited contagious yawning in VR, even though participants were viewing a virtual environment and unable to see the researcher. Unlike previous research, however, manipulating the social presence in VR (i.e., embedding recording devices and humanoid avatars within the simulation) did not affect contagious yawning. These experiments provide further evidence that social presence is a powerful deterrent of yawning in humans, which warrants further investigation. More generally, these findings also have important applications for the use of VR in psychological research. While participants were quite sensitive to social stimuli presented in VR, as evidenced by contagious yawning, our results suggest a major difference in the influence of social factors within real-world and virtual environments. That is, social cues in actual reality appear to dominate and supersede those in VR.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2019,"Gallup, Andrew C.; Vasilyev, Daniil; Anderson, Nicola; Kingstone, Alan",SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,,2045-2322,E4HJ9T2W,10.1038/s41598-018-36570-2,,2019-01-22T00:00:00Z,2021-02-11T04:15:46Z,2021-02-11T04:15:46Z,,,,,9,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND Publisher: NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP Type: Article",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web of Science,"contagious yawning in virtual reality is affected by actual, but not simulated, social presence",contagious yawning in virtual reality is affected by actual but not simulated social presence
,,,,,,,,,,Joint attention difficulties in autistic adults: An interactive eye-tracking study,"Joint attention - the ability to coordinate attention with a social partner - is critical for social communication, learning and the regulation of interpersonal relationships. Infants and young children with autism demonstrate impairments in both initiating and responding to joint attention bids in naturalistic settings. However, little is known about joint attention abilities in adults with autism. Here, we tested 17 autistic adults and 17 age- and nonverbal intelligence quotient-matched controls using an interactive eye-tracking paradigm in which participants initiated and responded to joint attention bids with an on-screen avatar. Compared to control participants, autistic adults completed fewer trials successfully. They were also slower to respond to joint attention bids in the first block of testing but performed as well as controls in the second block. There were no group differences in responding to spatial cues on a non-social task with similar attention and oculomotor demands. These experimental results were mirrored in the subjective reports given by participants, with some commenting that they initially found it challenging to communicate using eye gaze, but were able to develop strategies that allowed them to achieve joint attention. Our study indicates that for many autistic individuals, subtle difficulties using eye-gaze information persist well into adulthood.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2018,"Caruana, Nathan; Ham, Heidi Stieglitz; Brock, Jon; Woolgar, Alexandra; Kloth, Nadine; Palermo, Romina; McArthur, Genevieve",AUTISM,,1362-3613,X8X2VMQX,10.1177/1362361316676204,,2018-05-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-11T04:15:48Z,2021-02-11T04:15:48Z,,502-512,,4,22,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: 1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND Publisher: SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD Type: Article",,,,autism; social interaction; eye tracking; eye gaze; joint attention,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web of Science,joint attention difficulties in autistic adults: an interactive eye-tracking study,joint attention difficulties in autistic adults an interactive eyetracking study

,,,,,,,,,,The effect of an avatar's emotional expressions on players' fear reactions: The mediating role of embodiment,"This research aimed to demonstrate the effects of an avatar's emotional expressions on players' fear reactions during horror gameplay. In Study 1, we found that the emotional expressions of an avatar decreased fear reactions among players. This effect was mediated by avatar embodiment. More precisely, avatar emotional expressions lower avatar embodiment, which, in turn, positively predicts players' fear reactions. In Study 2, we replicated the findings of Study 1. In addition, we found that the effects observed in Study 1 were only present in interactive gameplay-not when players watched screen-captured footage of the game. In other words, we found evidence of a moderated mediation model in which interactivity moderates the effects of an avatar's emotional expressions on players' fear reactions through avatar embodiment.

,,,,,,,,,,"A Little Anthropomorphism Goes a Long Way: Effects of Oxytocin on Trust, Compliance, and Team Performance With Automated Agents","Objective: We investigated the effects of exogenous oxytocin on trust, compliance, and team decision making with agents varying in anthropomorphism (computer, avatar, human) and reliability (100%, 50%). Background: Authors of recent work have explored psychological similarities in how people trust humanlike automation compared with how they trust other humans. Exogenous administration of oxytocin, a neuropeptide associated with trust among humans, offers a unique opportunity to probe the anthropomorphism continuum of automation to infer when agents are trusted like another human or merely a machine. Method: Eighty-four healthy male participants collaborated with automated agents varying in anthropomorphism that provided recommendations in a pattern recognition task. Results: Under placebo, participants exhibited less trust and compliance with automated aids as the anthropomorphism of those aids increased. Under oxytocin, participants interacted with aids on the extremes of the anthropomorphism continuum similarly to placebos but increased their trust, compliance, and performance with the avatar, an agent on the midpoint of the anthropomorphism continuum. Conclusion: This study provides the first evidence that administration of exogenous oxytocin affected trust, compliance, and team decision making with automated agents. These effects provide support for the premise that oxytocin increases affinity for social stimuli in automated aids. Application: Designing automation to mimic basic human characteristics is sufficient to elicit behavioral trust outcomes that are driven by neurological processes typically observed in human-human interactions. Designers of automated systems should consider the task, the individual, and the level of anthropomorphism to achieve the desired outcome.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2017,"de Visser, Ewart J.; Monfort, Samuel S.; Goodyear, Kimberly; Lu, Li; O'Hara, Martin; Lee, Mary R.; Parasuraman, Raja; Krueger, Frank",HUMAN FACTORS,,0018-7208,XXRR9ZSH,10.1177/0018720816687205,,2017-02-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-11T04:15:51Z,2021-02-11T04:15:51Z,,116-133,,1,59,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,"Place: 2455 ℡LER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA Publisher: SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC Type: Article",,,,neuroergonomics; virtual humans; autonomous agents; compliance and reliance; human-automation interaction; oxytocin; trust in automation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Web of Science,"a little anthropomorphism goes a long way: effects of oxytocin on trust, compliance, and team performance with automated agents",a little anthropomorphism goes a long way effects of oxytocin on trust compliance and team performance with automated agents
,,,,,,,,,,Seeing pain and pleasure on self and others: behavioral and psychophysiological reactivity in immersive virtual reality,"Studies have explored behavioral and neural responses to the observation of pain in others. However, much less is known about how taking a physical perspective influences reactivity to the observation of others' pain and pleasure. To explore this issue we devised a novel paradigm in which 24 healthy participants immersed in a virtual reality scenario observed a virtual: needle penetrating (pain), caress (pleasure), or ball touching (neutral) the hand of an avatar seen from a first (1PP)- or a third (3PP)-person perspective. Subjective ratings and physiological responses [skin conductance responses (SCR) and heart rate (HR)] were collected in each trial. All participants reported strong feelings of ownership of the virtual hand only in 1PP. Subjective measures also showed that pain and pleasure were experienced as more salient than neutral. SCR analysis demonstrated higher reactivity in 1PP than in 3PP. Importantly, vicarious pain induced stronger responses with respect to the other conditions in both perspectives. HR analysis revealed equally lower activity during pain and pleasure with respect to neutral. SCR may reflect egocentric perspective, and HR may merely index general arousal. The results suggest that behavioral and physiological indexes of reactivity to seeing others' pain and pleasure were qualitatively similar in 1PP and 3PP. Our paradigm indicates that virtual reality can be used to study vicarious sensation of pain and pleasure without actually delivering any stimulus to participants' real body and to explore behavioral and physiological reactivity when they observe pain and pleasure from ego- and allocentric perspectives.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2016,"Fusaro, M.; Tieri, G.; Aglioti, S.

,,,,,,,,,,Auto-empathy or the others-in-oneself's evolution: Definition and clinic of virtual,"Objectives. - The authors propose to explore a psychic phenomenon, the “auto-empathy”, as implemented in the context of digital spaces and particularly in the situation of the player who embodies an avatar (a pixel figure) in a video game. Method. - From the perspective of a theoretical opening both phenomenological and psychoanalytic, auto empathy is the process in which, taking the position of the “other-in-oneself”, we represent our subjective world - or the all states of our subjectivity (actions, emotions, thoughts) - by an empathic relationship with ourselves. The auto-empathy relationship is a process of distancing, and symbolic appropriation, in which we are divided into halves, implementing our innate ability to be both subject and object for ourselves. Results. - The mediatization of auto-empathy in digital worlds can put ourselves instead of a figure that represents us - our avatar - so that our empathy is turned towards ourselves indirectly. This second time of empathy for a virtual figure of the self, called “mediatized auto-empathy” or “virtual auto-empathy”, would contribute thirdly to the development of empathy for oneself. Finally, the development of empathy for others would be supported in a fourth time, by the attention the players are paying to each other in network games. Discussion. - These four hypotheses, illustrated by clinical cases, open an interrogation concerning the frame of the psychoanalytical work. In the adolescent, the `work of virtualisation, which consists in the creative anticipation of its subjective possibilities, seems regularly impeded. The mental duplicity is no longer in a position to operate a symbolizing distance between the real self and the virtual self, between the subjective self and the subjectivising self. The other-in-oneself is ineffective in proposing to the adolescent an empathic dialogue with oneself. Consequently, the autorepresentation flirts with the seizure, in particular in the subjective states of breaks. Nevertheless, the digital spaces could be indirect media of appropriation of subjective experiences for the teenager. Conclusion. - Our reflections led us to think of auto-empathy as the realization of the other-in-oneself which allows us to represent our own subjective world. The auto-empathy mediatized by an avatar can thus be described as a representation by empathy of our subjective part that contains this character. From then on, the space of the video game appears as a space of subjectivation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.

,,,,,,,,,,Feeling the pain of others is associated with self-other confusion and prior pain experience,"Some chronic pain patients and healthy individuals experience pain when observing injury or others in pain. To further understand shared pain, we investigated perspective taking, bodily ownership and tooth pain sensitivity. First, participants who reported shared pain (responders) and those who did not (non-responders) viewed an avatar on a screen. Intermittently, 0-3 circles appeared. Sometimes the participant's and avatar's perspective were consistent, both directly viewed the same circles, and sometimes inconsistent, both directly viewed different circles. Responders were faster than non-responders to identify the number of circles when adopting a consistent perspective. Second, participants sat with their left hand hidden while viewing a rubber hand. All participants reported an illusory sensation of feeling stroking in the rubber hand and a sense of ownership of the rubber hand during synchronous stroking of the rubber and hidden hand. The responders also reported feeling the stroking and a sense of ownership of the rubber hand during asynchronous stroking. For experiment three, participants with either low, moderate, or high tooth sensitivity observed a series of images depicting someone eating an ice-popsicle. Low sensitivity participants never reported pain. In contrast, moderate and high sensitivity participants reported pain in response to an image depicting someone eating an ice popsicle (4 and 19% of the time, respectively) and depicting someone eating an ice-popsicle and expressing pain (23 and 40%, respectively). In summary, responders have reduced ability to distinguish their own and others' visual perspective and enhanced ability to integrate a foreign arm into their bodily representation. The tendency to share pain is also enhanced when an observed pain is commonly experienced by the observer. Shared pain may therefore when an observed pain is commonly experienced by the observer shared pain may therefore involve reactivation of pain memories or pain schema that are readily integrated into a self perspective and bodily representation.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2013,"Derbyshire, Stuart W.

,,,,,,,,,,Virtual Superheroes: Using Superpowers in Virtual Reality to Encourage Prosocial Behavior,"Background: Recent studies have shown that playing prosocial video games leads to greater subsequent prosocial behavior in the real world. However, immersive virtual reality allows people to occupy avatars that are different from them in a perceptually realistic manner. We examine how occupying an avatar with the superhero ability to fly increases helping behavior. Principal Findings: Using a two-by-two design, participants were either given the power of flight (their arm movements were tracked to control their flight akin to Superman's flying ability) or rode as a passenger in a helicopter, and were assigned one of two tasks, either to help find a missing diabetic child in need of insulin or to tour a virtual city. Participants in the “super-flight” conditions helped the experimenter pick up spilled pens after their virtual experience significantly more than those who were virtual passengers in a helicopter. Conclusion: The results indicate that having the “superpower” of flight leads to greater helping behavior in the real world, regardless of how participants used that power. A possible mechanism for this result is that having the power of flight primed concepts and prototypes associated with superheroes (e.g., Superman).

,,,,,,,,,,Facial mimicry and the mirror neuron system: simultaneous acquisition of facial electromyography and functional magnetic resonance imaging,"Numerous studies have shown that humans automatically react with congruent facial reactions, i.e., facial mimicry, when seeing a vis-a-vis' facial expressions. The current experiment is the first investigating the neuronal structures responsible for differences in the occurrence of such facial mimicry reactions by simultaneously measuring BOLD and facial EMG in an MRI scanner. Therefore, 20 female students viewed emotional facial expressions (happy, sad, and angry) of male and female avatar characters. During picture presentation, the BOLD signal as well as M. zygomaticus major and M. corrugator supercilii activity were recorded simultaneously. Results show prototypical patterns of facial mimicry after correction for MR related artifacts: enhanced M. zygomaticus major activity in response to happy and enhanced M. corrugator supercilii activity in response to sad and angry expressions. Regression analyses show that these congruent facial reactions correlate significantly with activations in the IFG, SMA, and cerebellum. Stronger zygomaticus reactions to happy faces were further associated to increased activities in the caudate, MTG, and PCC. Corrugator reactions to angry expressions were further correlated with the hippocampus, insula, and STS. Results are discussed in relation to core and extended models of the mirror neuron system (MNS).",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2012,"Likowski, Katja U.; Muehlberger, Andreas; Gerdes, Antje B.

,,,,,,,,,,How the Human Brain Goes Virtual: Distinct Cortical Regions of the Person-Processing Network Are Involved in Self-Identification with Virtual Agents,"Millions of people worldwide engage in online role-playing with their avatar, a virtual agent that represents the self. Previous behavioral studies have indicated that many gamers identify more strongly with their avatar than with their biological self. Through their avatar, gamers develop social networks and learn new social-cognitive skills. The cognitive neurosciences have yet to identify the neural processes that underlie self-identification with these virtual agents. We applied functional neuroimaging to 22 long-term online gamers and 21 nongaming controls, while they rated personality traits of self, avatar, and familiar others. Strikingly, neuroimaging data revealed greater avatar-referential cortical activity in the left inferior parietal lobe, a region associated with self-identification from a third-person perspective. The magnitude of this brain activity correlated positively with the propensity to incorporate external body enhancements into one's bodily identity. Avatar-referencing furthermore recruited greater activity in the rostral anterior cingulate gyrus, suggesting relatively greater emotional self-involvement with one's avatar. Post-scanning behavioral data revealed superior recognition memory for avatar relative to others. Interestingly, memory for avatar positively covaried with play duration.

,,,,,,,,,,Development and evaluation of a social robot platform for therapy in autism.,"People with ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorders) have difficulty in managing interpersonal relationships and common life social situations. A modular platform for Human Robot Interaction and Human Machine Interaction studies has been developed to manage and analyze therapeutic sessions in which subjects are driven by a psychologist through simulated social scenarios. This innovative therapeutic approach uses a humanoid robot called FACE capable of expressing and conveying emotions and empathy. Using FACE as a social interlocutor the psychologist can emulate real life scenarios where the emotional state of the interlocutor is adaptively adjusted through a semi closed loop control algorithm which uses the ASD subject's inferred ""affective"" state as input. Preliminary results demonstrate that the platform is well accepted by ASDs and can be consequently used as novel therapy for social skills training.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2011,Mazzei D; Lazzeri N; Billeci L; Igliozzi R; Mancini A; Ahluwalia A; Muratori F; De Rossi D,Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

,,,,,,,,,,Appearance of a Robot Affects the Impact of itsBehaviour on Perceived Trustworthiness andEmpathy,"An increasing number of companion robots havestarted reaching the public in the recent years. Theserobots vary in their appearance and behavior. Since thesetwo factors can have an impact on lasting human-robotrelationships, it is important to understand their effect forcompanion robots.We have conducted an experiment thatevaluated the impact of a robot’s appearance and its behaviourin repeated interactions on its perceived empathy,trustworthiness and anxiety experienced by a human. Theresults indicate that a highly humanlike robot is perceivedas less trustworthy and empathic than a more machinelikerobot. Moreover, negative behaviour of a machinelikerobot reduces its trustworthiness and perceived empathystronger than for highly humanlike robot. In addition, wefound that a robot which disapproves of what a humansays can induce anxiety felt towards its communicationcapabilities. Our findings suggest that more machinelikerobots can be more suitable as companions than highlyhumanlike robots. Moreover, a robot disagreeing with ahuman interaction partner should be able to provide feedbackon its understanding of the partner’s message in orderto reduce her anxiety.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2016,,Paladyn: Journal of Behavioral Robotics,,2081-4836,2AX8TN9L,,,2016-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:17:55Z,2021-02-15T22:17:55Z,,,,,7,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Open WorldCat,,OCLC: 7180210175,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WorldCat,appearance of a robot affects the impact of itsbehaviour on perceived trustworthiness andempathy,appearance of a robot affects the impact of itsbehaviour on perceived trustworthiness andempathy
,,,,,,,,,,From Computational Emotional Models to HRI,"During the previous stage of our research we developed a computer simulation (called ‘The Panic Room’ or, more simply, ‘TPR’) dealing with synthetic emotions. The authors were developing the first steps towards an evolutionary machine, defining the key elements involved in the development of complex actions (that is, creating a physical intuitive ontology, from a bottom-up approach). After the successful initial results of TPR, the authors considered that it would be necessary to develop a new simulation (which the authors will call “TPR 2.0.”), more complex and with better visualisation characteristics. After this, the authors created a simulation on emotions evolution with genetic algorithms (Game Of Emotions, GOE) which results on the value of specific emotions into social domains were applied to HRI real robotic environments at Nishidalab (Japan), focused into the notions of empathy and proxemics. There the authors performed an experiment that involved humans from two different native-speaking cultures and one robot introduced as three different machines. The final HRI obtained data was analyzed under several research field perspectives: psychology, philosophy, robotic sciences and anthropology.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2013,"Vallverdú, J; Casacuberta, D; Nishida, T; Ohmoto, Y; Moran, S; Lázare, S",International Journal of Robotics Applications and Technologies (IJRAT),,2166-7195,9CM3TNGR,,,2013-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:18:05Z,2021-02-15T22:18:05Z,,11-25,,2,1,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Open WorldCat,,OCLC: 5542432010,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WorldCat,from computational emotional models to hri,from computational emotional models to hri
,,,,,,,,,,Ethica ex machina: issues in roboethics.,"Is ""roboethics"" the ""ethics of humans"" or the ""ethics of robots""? According to the Roboethics Roadmap (Gianmarco Veruggio), it is the human ethics of robot designers, manufacturers, and users. And ifroboethics roots deeply in society, artificial ethics (ethics of robots) might be put on the agenda some day. At the 1st International Symposium on Roboethics in San Remo, Ronald C. Arkin gave the presentation ""Bombs, Bonding, and Bondage: Human-Robot Interaction and Related Ethical Issues"" (2004). ""Bondage"" is the issue of enslavement and possible rebellion of robots. ""Bombs"" is the issue of military use of robots. And ""bonding"" is the issue of affective, emotional attachment of humans to robots. I contrast two extreme attitudes towards the issue of ""bonding"" and propose a middle ground. ""Anthropomorphism"" has two meanings. First, it means ""human-shaped-ness."" Second, it means ""attribution of human characteristics or feelings to a nonhuman being (god, animal, or object)"" (personification, empathy). Some say that Japanese (or East Asians) hold ""animism,"" which makes it easy for them to treat robots like animated beings (to anthropomorphize robots); hence ""Robot Kingdom Japan."" Cosima Wagner criticizes such exaggeration and oversimplification as ""invented tradition"". I reinforce her argument with neuroscientific findings and argue that such ""animism"" is neither Shintoistic nor Buddhistic, but a universal tendency. Roboticists, especially Japanese roboticists emphasize that robotics is ""anthropology."" It is true that through the construction of humanoid robots we can better understand human beings (so-called ""constructive approach""). But at the same time, we must not forget that robotic technology, like any other technology, changes our way of living and being--deeply: it can bring about our ontological transformation. In this sense, the governance of robotic technology is ""governed governance."" The interdisciplinary research area of technology assessment studies (TAS) will gain much importance. And we should always be ready to rethink the direction of the research and development of robotic technology, bearing the desirable future of human society in mind.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2013,Mushiaki S,Journal international de bioethique = International journal of bioethics,,1145-0762,34QN8EIR,,,2013-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:18:35Z,2021-02-15T22:18:35Z,,17-26,,4,24,,,Ethica ex machina,,,,,,,English,,,,,Open WorldCat,,OCLC: 5537702789,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WorldCat,ethica ex machina: issues in roboethics.,ethica ex machina issues in roboethics
,,,,,,,,,,Creation and Staging of Android Theatre “Sayonara”towards Developing Highly Human-Like Robots,"Even after long-term exposures, androids with a strikingly human-like appearance evoke unnatural feelings. The behavior that would induce human-like feelings after long exposures is difficult to determine, and it often depends on the cultural background of the observers. Therefore, in this study, we generate an acting performance system for the android, in which an android and a human interact in a stage play in the real world. We adopt the theatrical theory called Contemporary Colloquial Theatre Theory to give the android natural behaviors so that audiences can comfortably observe it even after long-minute exposure. A stage play is created and shown in various locations, and the audiences are requested to report their impressions of the stage and their cultural and psychological backgrounds in a self-evaluating questionnaire. Overall analysis indicates that the audience had positive feelings, in terms of attractiveness, towards the android on the stage even after 20 min of exposure. The singularly high acceptance of the android by Japanese audiences seems to be correlated with a high animism tendency, rather than to empathy. We also discuss how the stage play approach is limited and could be extended to contribute to realization of human-robot interaction in the real world.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2017,,Future Internet,,1999-5903,DWHP9IS5,,,2017-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:18:35Z,2021-02-15T22:18:35Z,,,,4,9,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Open WorldCat,,OCLC: 8081433483,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WorldCat,creation and staging of android theatre “sayonara”towards developing highly human-like robots,creation and staging of android theatre sayonaratowards developing highly humanlike robots
,,,,,,,,,,Affective Embodied Agents and Their Effect on Decision Making,"Embodied agents, such as avatars and social robots, are increasingly incorporating a capacity to enact affective states and recognize the mood of their interlocutor. This influences how users perceive these technologies and how they interact with them. We report on an experiment aimed at assessing perceived empathy and fairness among individuals interacting with avatars and robots when compared to playing against a computer or a fellow human being. Twenty-one individuals were asked to play the ultimatum game, playing the role of a responder against another person, a computer, an avatar and a robot for a total of 32 games (8 per condition). We hypothesize that affective expressions by avatars and robots influence the emotional state of the users, leading them to irrational behavior by rejecting unfair proposals. We monitored galvanic skin response and heart rate of the players in the period when the offer was made by the proposer until the decision was announced by the responder. Our results show that most fair offers were accepted while most unfair offers were rejected. However, participants rejected more very unfair offers made by people and computers than by the avatars or robots.",,0,0,0,0,0,journalArticle,2019,,Proceedings,,2504-3900,5QVTJRU5,,,2019-01-01T00:00:00Z,2021-02-15T22:18:35Z,2021-02-15T22:18:35Z,,,,1,31,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Open WorldCat,,OCLC: 8464672719,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WorldCat,affective embodied agents and their effect on decision making,affective embodied agents and their effect on decision making
