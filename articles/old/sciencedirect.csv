Although the replacement of human counsellors remains a speculative prospect, chatbots for ‘narrow AI’ tasks (e.g., assessment and referral) are increasingly being used to augment clinical practice. Little research has addressed the possibilities for care that chatbots may generate in the future, particularly in the context of alcohol and other drug counselling. To explore these issues, we draw on the concept of technological ‘affordances’ and identify the range of possibilities for care that emerging chatbot interventions may afford and foreclose depending on the contexts in which they are implemented. Our analysis is based on qualitative data from interviews with clients (n=20) and focus group discussions with counsellors (n=8) conducted as part of a larger study of an Australian online alcohol and other drug counselling service. Both clients and counsellors expressed a concern that chatbot interventions lacked a ‘human’ element, which they valued in empathic care encounters. Most clients reported that they would share less information with a chatbot than a human counsellor, and they viewed this as constraining care. However, clients and counsellors suggested that the use of narrow AI might afford possibilities for performing discrete tasks, such as screening, triage or referral. In the context of what we refer to as ‘more-than-human’ care, our findings reveal complex views about the types of affordances that chatbots may produce and foreclose in online care encounters. We conclude by discussing implications for the potential ‘addiction futures’ and care trajectories that AI technologies offer, focussing on how they might inform alcohol and other drug policy, and the design of digital healthcare.","2020-10","2021-02-15 21:44:16","2021-02-15 21:44:16","2021-02-15 21:44:16","102910","","","","","International Journal of Drug Policy","Enacting ‘more-than-human’ care","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\esben\Zotero\storage\VWZHGT2F\Barnett et al. - 2020 - Enacting ‘more-than-human’ care Clients’ and coun.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Still, explanations as to why slightly imperfect human-like characters can evoke feelings of eeriness remain the subject of controversy. Many experiments exploring the phenomenon have emphasized speciﬁc visual factors in connection to evolutionary psychological theories or an underlying categorization conﬂict. More recently, studies have also shifted away focus from the appearance of human-like entities, instead exploring their mental capabilities as basis for observers’ discomfort. In order to advance this perspective, we introduced 92 participants to a virtual reality (VR) chat program and presented them with two digital characters engaged in an emotional and empathic dialogue. Using the same prerecorded 3D scene, we manipulated the perceived control type of the depicted characters (humancontrolled avatars vs. computer-controlled agents), as well as their alleged level of autonomy (scripted vs. self-directed actions). Statistical analyses revealed that participants experienced signiﬁcantly stronger eeriness if they perceived the empathic characters to be autonomous artiﬁcial intelligences. As human likeness and attractiveness ratings did not result in signiﬁcant group differences, we present our results as evidence for an ‘‘uncanny valley of mind‘‘ that relies on the attribution of emotions and social cognition to non-human entities. A possible relationship to the philosophy of anthropocentrism and its ‘‘threat to human distinctiveness” concept is discussed.","2017-03","2021-02-15 21:44:31","2021-02-15 21:44:31","2021-02-15 21:44:31","43-50","","","160","","Cognition","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\esben\Zotero\storage\IK2DKCQ4\Stein and Ohler - 2017 - Venturing into the uncanny valley of mind—The infl.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Mental health appears ripe for such disruption given the global illness burden, stigma, and shortage of care providers. Objective: To characterize the global psychiatrist community’s opinion regarding the potential of future autonomous technology (referred to here as AI/ML) to replace key tasks carried out in mental health practice. Design: Cross sectional, random stratiﬁed sample of psychiatrists registered with Sermo, a global networking platform open to veriﬁed and licensed physicians. Main outcome measures: We measured opinions about the likelihood that AI/ML tools would be able to fully replace – not just assist – the average psychiatrist in performing 10 key psychiatric tasks. Among those who considered replacement likely, we measured opinions about how many years from now such a capacity might emerge. We also measured psychiatrist’s perceptions about whether beneﬁts of AI/ML would outweigh the risks. Results: Survey respondents were 791 psychiatrists from 22 countries representing North America, South America, Europe and Asia-Paciﬁc. Only 3.8 % of respondents felt it was likely that future technology would make their jobs obsolete and only 17 % felt that future AI/ML was likely to replace a human clinician for providing empathetic care. Documenting and updating medical records (75 %) and synthesizing information (54 %) were the two tasks where a majority predicted that AI/ML could fully replace human psychiatrists. Female- and USbased doctors were more uncertain that the beneﬁts of AI would outweigh risks than male- and non-US doctors, respectively. Around one in 2 psychiatrists did however predict that their jobs would be substantially changed by AI/ML. Conclusions: Our ﬁndings provide compelling insights into how physicians think about AI/ML which in turn may help us better integrate technology and reskill doctors to enhance mental health care.","2020-01","2021-02-15 21:44:38","2021-02-15 21:44:38","2021-02-15 21:44:38","101753","","","102","","Artificial Intelligence in Medicine","Artificial intelligence and the future of psychiatry","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\esben\Zotero\storage\R4HF47EC\Doraiswamy et al. - 2020 - Artificial intelligence and the future of psychiat.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The two factors covered in Study 1 are utilitarian benefit based on egoistic motivation, and empathy based on altruistic motivation. In Study 2, utilitarian benefit is divided into explainable AI and monetary reward. The results indicate that two variables, namely empathy and monetary reward, have significant positive effects on willingness to help, and monetary reward is the strongest stimulus. In addition, explainable AI is shown to be positively associated with trust in AI. This study applies social studies of help motivation to the HCI field in order to induce users' willingness to help for an imperfect AI.

Computer-based personal assistance can help to behave healthy by persuading and guiding older adults. For effective persuasion, the assistant should express social behaviors (e.g., turn taking, emotional expressions) to be trustworthy and show empathy. From the motivational interviewing method and synthetic assistants’ literature, we derived a set of social behaviors, and implemented a subset in a physical character, a virtual character and a text interface. The first behavior type concerns conversing with high-level dialogue (semantics, intentions), which could be implemented in all 3 assistants. The other behavior types could only be implemented in the characters: showing natural cues (e.g., gaze, posture), expressing emotions (e.g., compassionate face), and accommodating social conversations (e.g., turn taking). In an experiment, 24 older adults (45–65) interacted with the text interface and one of the characters, conform a “one-week diabetics scenario”. They experienced the virtual and physical character as more empathic and trustworthy than the text-based assistant, and expressed more conversational behavior with the characters. However, it seems that the preference of interacting with the character or the text interface was influenced by the conscientiousness of the participant; more conscientious people liked the text interface better. Older adults responded more negative to the characters that lacked the social behaviors than to the text interface. Some differences between the virtual and physical character probably occurred due to the specific constraints of the physical character.","2010","2021-02-15 21:45:52","2021-02-15 21:45:52","","386-397","","6","68","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Human-Computer Interaction for Medicine and Health care (HCI4MED): Towards making Information usable</p>","","","Health-care; Persuasive computing; Human–robot interaction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This aspect of the paper is based on prior research in a European-funded technology foresight project that explored the ethical issues of emerging ICTs. The paper goes beyond the description of technical innovation and its ethical consequences. The recognition of the ethical relevance of research and innovation has spawned a discourse around responsible research and innovation. The paper draws on this discourse, which aims at anticipatory technology governance to ensure the social acceptability and desirability of technologies. The prototype vignette of the paper explores how responsible research and innovation could be realised in practice and how it could be used to address ethical issues such as those of affective care robots.

Recent studies about pain empathy for robots found humans present similar empathy process towards humanoid robots under painful stimuli as well as to humans. However, the whole-brain functional connectivity and the spatial dynamics of neural activities underlying empathic processes are still unknown. In the present study, the functional connectivity was investigated for ERPs recorded from 18 healthy adults who were presented with pictures of human hand and robot hand under painful and non-painful situations. Functional brain networks for both early and late empathy responses were constructed and a new parameter, empathy index (EI), was proposed to represent the empathy ability of humans quantitatively. We found that the mutual dependences between early ERP components was significantly decreased, but for the late components, there were no significant changes. The mutual dependences for human hand stimuli were larger than to robot hand stimuli for early components, but not for late components. The connectivity weights for early components were larger than late components. EI value shows significant difference between painful and non-painful stimuli, indicating it is a good indicator to represent the empathy of humans. This study enriches our understanding of the neurological mechanisms implicated in human empathy, and provides evidence of functional connectivity for both early and late responses of pain empathy towards humans and robots.","2021","2021-02-15 21:45:52","2021-02-15 21:45:52","","107695","","","151","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EEG; Functional connectivity; Empathy; Human-robot interaction; Empathy index; Mutual information","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet, an interesting and provocative question emerges in the case of personified robots: How do people conceive of life-like robots? Do people imagine about robots’ experiences? If so, do these imaginings reflect their actual or pretend beliefs about robots? The answers to these questions bear on the possibility that personified robots represent the emergence of a new ontological category. We draw on simulation theory as a framework for imagining others’ internal states as well as a means for imaginative play. We then turn to the literature on people’s and, in particular, children’s conceptions of personified technologies and raise the question of the veracity of children’s beliefs about personified robots (i.e., are they behaving as or behaving as if?).

To achieve this, robots must interact with people in natural ways, employing social mechanisms that people use while interacting with each other. One such mechanism is empathy, often seen as the basis of social cooperation and prosocial behaviour. We argue that artificial companions capable of behaving in an empathic manner, which involves the capacity to recognise another's affect and respond appropriately, are more successful at establishing and maintaining a positive relationship with users. This paper presents a study where an autonomous robot with empathic capabilities acts as a social companion to two players in a chess game. The robot reacts to the moves played on the chessboard by displaying several facial expressions and verbal utterances, showing empathic behaviours towards one player and behaving neutrally towards the other. Quantitative and qualitative results of 31 participants indicate that users towards whom the robot behaved empathically perceived the robot as friendlier, which supports our hypothesis that empathy plays a key role in human–robot interaction.","2013","2021-02-15 21:45:53","2021-02-15 21:45:53","","250-260","","3","71","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\esben\Zotero\storage\T695PACG\Leite et al. - 2013 - The influence of empathy in human–robot relations.pdf","","Empathy; Social robots; Affective interactions; Artificial companions; Friendship","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet space exploration is costly, and the awaiting environment challenges us with extreme cold, heat, vacuum and radiation, unlike anything encountered on Earth. Thus, the few pioneers who experience it needed to be well protected throughout their spaceflight. The resulting isolation heightens the senses and increases the desire to make humanly connections with any other perceived manifestation of life. Such connections may occur via sensory inputs, namely vision, touch, sound, smell, and taste. This then follows the process of sensing, interpreting, and recognizing familiar patterns, or learning from new experiences. The desire to connect could even transfer to observed objects, if their movements and characteristics trigger the appropriate desires from the observer. When ordered in a familiar way, for example visual stimuli from lights and movements of an object, it may create a perceived real bond with an observer, and evoke the feeling of surprise when the expected behavior changes to something no longer predictable or recognizable. These behavior patterns can be designed into an object and performed autonomously in front of an observer, in our case an astronaut. The experience may introduce multiple responses, including communication, connection, empathy, order, and disorder. While emotions are clearly evoked in the observer and may seem one sided, in effect the object itself provides a decoupled bond, connectivity and communication between the observer and the artist-designer of the object. In this paper we will discuss examples from the field of arts and other domains, including robotics, where human perception through object interaction was explored, and investigate the starting point for new innovative design concepts and future prototype designs, that extend these experiences beyond the boundaries of Earth, while taking advantage of remoteness and the zero gravity environment. Through a form of emotional connection and design, these concepts will focus on the connection and brief emotional bond between a humanly animate object in space and a co-located observer in spaceflight. We conclude that beyond providing creative expressions for humanly contacts, these experiences may also provide further insights into human perception in spaceflight, and could be tested on the International Space Station, and serve as a stepping-stone towards use on long-duration spaceflight to Mars.","2015","2021-02-15 21:45:53","2021-02-15 21:45:53","","129-144","","","110","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Dynamics and Control of Space Systems</p>","C:\Users\esben\Zotero\storage\BDGGBX84\Balint and Hall - 2015 - Humanly space objects—Perception and connection wi.pdf","","Perception; Cognition; Affordances; Design; Art; Cybernetics; Tacit-knowledge","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The interaction between type of vicarious experience (pain, touch) and nature of model (adult, baby, dog, robot) showed that the right supramarginal gyrus (rSMG) was selectively active for visual similarity (more active during vicarious pain for the adult and baby models), while the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) was more sensitive to psychological closeness (specifically linked to vicarious pain for the baby model).

Although the replacement of human counsellors remains a speculative prospect, chatbots for ‘narrow AI’ tasks (e.g., assessment and referral) are increasingly being used to augment clinical practice. Little research has addressed the possibilities for care that chatbots may generate in the future, particularly in the context of alcohol and other drug counselling. To explore these issues, we draw on the concept of technological ‘affordances’ and identify the range of possibilities for care that emerging chatbot interventions may afford and foreclose depending on the contexts in which they are implemented. Our analysis is based on qualitative data from interviews with clients (n=20) and focus group discussions with counsellors (n=8) conducted as part of a larger study of an Australian online alcohol and other drug counselling service. Both clients and counsellors expressed a concern that chatbot interventions lacked a ‘human’ element, which they valued in empathic care encounters. Most clients reported that they would share less information with a chatbot than a human counsellor, and they viewed this as constraining care. However, clients and counsellors suggested that the use of narrow AI might afford possibilities for performing discrete tasks, such as screening, triage or referral. In the context of what we refer to as ‘more-than-human’ care, our findings reveal complex views about the types of affordances that chatbots may produce and foreclose in online care encounters. We conclude by discussing implications for the potential ‘addiction futures’ and care trajectories that AI technologies offer, focussing on how they might inform alcohol and other drug policy, and the design of digital healthcare.","2020-10","2021-02-15 21:48:48","2021-02-15 21:48:48","2021-02-15 21:48:48","102910","","","","","International Journal of Drug Policy","Enacting ‘more-than-human’ care","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\esben\Zotero\storage\VBFNEFR8\Barnett et al. - 2020 - Enacting ‘more-than-human’ care Clients’ and coun.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Mental health appears ripe for such disruption given the global illness burden, stigma, and shortage of care providers. Objective To characterize the global psychiatrist community’s opinion regarding the potential of future autonomous technology (referred to here as AI/ML) to replace key tasks carried out in mental health practice. Design Cross sectional, random stratified sample of psychiatrists registered with Sermo, a global networking platform open to verified and licensed physicians. Main outcome measures We measured opinions about the likelihood that AI/ML tools would be able to fully replace – not just assist – the average psychiatrist in performing 10 key psychiatric tasks. Among those who considered replacement likely, we measured opinions about how many years from now such a capacity might emerge. We also measured psychiatrist’s perceptions about whether benefits of AI/ML would outweigh the risks. Results Survey respondents were 791 psychiatrists from 22 countries representing North America, South America, Europe and Asia-Pacific. Only 3.8 % of respondents felt it was likely that future technology would make their jobs obsolete and only 17 % felt that future AI/ML was likely to replace a human clinician for providing empathetic care. Documenting and updating medical records (75 %) and synthesizing information (54 %) were the two tasks where a majority predicted that AI/ML could fully replace human psychiatrists. Female- and US-based doctors were more uncertain that the benefits of AI would outweigh risks than male- and non-US doctors, respectively. Around one in 2 psychiatrists did however predict that their jobs would be substantially changed by AI/ML. Conclusions Our findings provide compelling insights into how physicians think about AI/ML which in turn may help us better integrate technology and reskill doctors to enhance mental health care.","2020","2021-02-15 21:49:29","2021-02-15 21:49:29","","101753","","","102","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Deep learning; Empathy; Autonomous agents; Mental health","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods A mixed methods approach which included quantitative and qualitative date tools. Results All three Hub and Spoke models shared two broad findings:1)In the three Hub and Spoke models detailed in this paper, there is a continuum of student led learning which supports the process with opportunities for individual students to be positively innovative and creative in their learning approaches. Depth of learning was achieved in two ways; a) the method in which Hub placements are organised, managed and structured and, b) the depth of empathy and sensitivity to the individual at the centre of the care.2)Placement capacity is increased: The classification of placements is reviewed to produce broader categories, Engagement of mentors/enhanced student/mentor relationship. Conclusions Practice Learning must be seen as an academic endeavour that promotes deep, meaningful, person-centred learning rather than superficial, compartmentalised placement-centred learning.","2012","2021-02-15 21:49:58","2021-02-15 21:49:58","","782-789","","7","32","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Selected papers from NET2011: The 22nd International Networking for Healthcare Education Conference, 6-8 September, 2011, Cambridge, UK</p>","","","Belongingness; Learning environments; Practice Learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A narrative, interpretive approach was undertaken to collect and analyse parent interview narratives. A specific question was posed to a purposive sample of parents who have had premature babies about what health professionals can learn from them. Thematic analysis revealed five key themes relating to the importance of: communicating; listening; empathising; acknowledging (the parent's role); realising (what matters to parents). These elements were incorporated into a framework named by the mnemonic, ‘CLEAR’. This highlights what parents want staff to be cognisant of when caring for them and their babies. Learning from the parents in our care enables a greater understanding of their experiences at difficult and challenging times.

Background Practitioners in many disciplines, including nursing, appreciate the value of narratives in making sense of experiences, challenging assumptions and enhancing learning: they enable exploration of reality from different perspectives and create an emotional resonance. Narratives help nursing students to uncover embedded meanings, values and beliefs; they can include written texts, illustrated texts or picture books. Participants 180 students enrolled in an elective undergraduate nursing course. Method This project afforded students the choice of critically analysing (a) a chapter from one of two autobiographies, (b) an illustrated text, or (c) an illustration from a picture book. Each text was a narrative account from a personal or carer's perspective of the experience of mental illness. Their written submissions were then analysed by means of a qualitative descriptive approach. Results In analysis of the autobiographies students tended to paraphrase the authors' words and summarise their experiences. Those choosing the illustrated text were able to link the images and text, and provide a deeper and more insightful level of interpretation, albeit influenced by the author's personal account and expressed emotions; however, those analysing a picture book illustration demonstrated a surprising level of critical and creative thinking, and their interpretations were empathetic, insightful and thoughtful. Conclusion The use of picture books, although not a common approach in nursing education, appears to engage students, challenge them to think more deeply, and stimulate their imagination.","2014","2021-02-15 21:49:58","2021-02-15 21:49:58","","586-591","","4","34","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Education; Empathy; Mental health; Nursing student; Picture books; Therapeutic engagement","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods During the years 2010–2012, students reflected on their emotions concerning BBN in a learning assignment at the end of the communications skills course. The students were asked to write a description of how they felt about a BBN case. The reflections were analysed using qualitative content analysis. Results 351 students agreed to participate in the study. We recognized ten categories in students’ reflections namely empathy, insecurity, anxiety, sadness, ambivalence, guilt, hope, frustration, gratefulness and emotional detachment. Most students expressed empathy, but there was a clear tension between feeling empathy and retaining professional distance by emotional detachment. Conclusions Students experience strong and perplexing emotions during their studies, especially in challenging situations. A deeper understanding of students' emotions is valuable for supporting students’ professional development and coping in their work in the future. Practice implications Medical students need opportunities to reflect on emotional experiences during their education to find strategies for coping with them. Emotions should be actively discussed in studies where the issues of BBN are addressed.

Diabetes camp is a setting that provides experiential learning on a topic that is crucial for future dietitians. Objective The objective of this study was to explore whether and how educational experiences at a residential camp for children with type 1 diabetes changes knowledge, perceptions, confidence, and empathy of the disease for dietetics students. Qualitative research methods were used to explore and understand participants’ experience of hands-on involvement with type one diabetes. Study Design, Setting, Participants This study was a qualitative, 2-year longitudinal case study at Camp Kno-Koma, the Diabetes Camp of West Virginia. Four dietetic students were recruited to participate in this study through convenience sampling. Students were in varying stages of their dietetics education. Measurable Outcome/Analysis Multiple qualitative methods were used to collect data: interviews; observations; Photovoice, a type of participatory action research in which photographs identified significant learning experiences; journaling; and focus groups. Thematic analysis was used to identify emerging themes and summarize findings through triangulation. Results Qualitative data analysis revealed that experiential learning at diabetes camp provides an opportunity for dietetics students to experience in-depth learning, including: increase in knowledge of the disease, perceptions of living with the disease, confidence in treating the disease, and empathy for those who have been diagnosed. While attending camp for one week is beneficial for experiential learning, returning for another week the following year provided a deeper understanding of the disease process. Students identified wearing an insulin pump and “living with diabetes” were their best learning experiences. Conclusions This study adds to the limited body of knowledge concerning dietetics students’ experiential learning at diabetes camps. The study's greatest contribution is the ability for educators to understand how experiential learning opportunities at diabetes camp provide in-depth education and how these learning experiences can be incorporated into dietetics curricula.","2020","2021-02-15 21:49:59","2021-02-15 21:49:59","","S50-S51","","7, Supplement","52","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>What Food Future?</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most service user involvement is through classroom visits. Digital stories, film and audio are alternatives but lack the interactivity and development of reflection that can be achieved through face-to-face contact. This report reviews the background to service user involvement in healthcare professional education then provides a reflective account of a novel initiative whereby a spinal-injured patient was involved in creating a digital story around some of his in-hospital experiences and then engaged in online discussions with post-registration nursing (degree) and practice educator (masters) students. These discussions provided a richer experience for the students enabling them to reflect more deeply on how nursing care is delivered and perceived by service users. The report concludes that digital stories can be used with repeated groups to inspire discussion and reflection. Augmenting such digital stories with online discussions with the service user whose story is told helps practitioners develop greater empathy, insight and understanding which are beneficial for improving service delivery and nursing care.","2012","2021-02-15 21:49:59","2021-02-15 21:49:59","","161-166","","2","32","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Service User &amp; Education</p>","","","Digital stories; E-learning; Nurse education; Service user involvement","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Four substantive themes (embodied remembering, gendered bodies, racialized bodies, and embodying the gaze) were developed from collective analyses of initial discussions. A deeper reflection on the potential of this approach for engendering critical tourism pedagogy was also undertaken to explore its potential as critical tourism pedagogy. Five pedagogical themes (building safe spaces and developing trust, creating empathy, engaging tourism literature in ‘real life’, opening doors for ongoing reflection, and decentring power and knowledge) were identified.

Its etiology has been deeply analyzed both for genetic and environmental implications. The role of family context has been underlined throughout the whole psychopathology as an explanation to the etiological conflict between nature and nurture. Even if this conflict seems to be apparently solved, it is still possible to ponder about family implications in terms of causes and consequences. In the antisocial field, maternal role may offer interesting and surprising food for thought. Even if it is commonly believed an intergenerational transmission of aberrant behaviors, particularly in terms of learning behaviors and lack of empathy assimilation, it exists a side part of maternal pathological expression that may play a role in the intergenerational transmission and it is extremely difficult to be detected. Female declination of this disorder may be expressed also through somatic implications and complaints, leading to the hypothesis of a self-reflection of the lack of consideration for other's needs, which is distinctive. It is of extreme importance, particularly in terms of prevention, to consider and identify these connotations of the disorder to be able to try to interrupt the cycle of transmission through generations.","2017","2021-02-15 21:49:59","2021-02-15 21:49:59","","S586","","","41","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Abstract of the 25th European Congress of Psychiatry</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Mental health appears ripe for such disruption given the global illness burden, stigma, and shortage of care providers. Objective To characterize the global psychiatrist community’s opinion regarding the potential of future autonomous technology (referred to here as AI/ML) to replace key tasks carried out in mental health practice. Design Cross sectional, random stratified sample of psychiatrists registered with Sermo, a global networking platform open to verified and licensed physicians. Main outcome measures We measured opinions about the likelihood that AI/ML tools would be able to fully replace – not just assist – the average psychiatrist in performing 10 key psychiatric tasks. Among those who considered replacement likely, we measured opinions about how many years from now such a capacity might emerge. We also measured psychiatrist’s perceptions about whether benefits of AI/ML would outweigh the risks. Results Survey respondents were 791 psychiatrists from 22 countries representing North America, South America, Europe and Asia-Pacific. Only 3.8 % of respondents felt it was likely that future technology would make their jobs obsolete and only 17 % felt that future AI/ML was likely to replace a human clinician for providing empathetic care. Documenting and updating medical records (75 %) and synthesizing information (54 %) were the two tasks where a majority predicted that AI/ML could fully replace human psychiatrists. Female- and US-based doctors were more uncertain that the benefits of AI would outweigh risks than male- and non-US doctors, respectively. Around one in 2 psychiatrists did however predict that their jobs would be substantially changed by AI/ML. Conclusions Our findings provide compelling insights into how physicians think about AI/ML which in turn may help us better integrate technology and reskill doctors to enhance mental health care.","2020","2021-02-15 21:49:59","2021-02-15 21:49:59","","101753","","","102","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Deep learning; Empathy; Autonomous agents; Mental health","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Through this strategy the pupils learn certain principles, skills of understanding and cognitive thinking, psychomotor skills and values/ ways of behavior, connected with certain certification, influences, readiness, alertness and empathy. The aim of this research is directed to assessment of the influence of the simulation strategy over the improvement of the classroom climate. From the actions, in this research were used observant field notes, that enabled an insight of the event through direct listening and looking by the pupils, and conceptual field notes that enabled making conclusions from the observation. From the instruments for registering the data was used a protocol for observation, aimed to the students, the pupils were observed during the classes and during the break. Another instrument that was used for the research is the questionnaire, aimed to the teachers and the experts. The use of the simulation strategy has a great influence over the creation of a positive climate in the class that it isn’t limited only in the process of classes realization, but it has broader and deeper dimension. It influences the positive dimension of the pupil's personality too as well as the development and straightening of the educational function of the school.

Medical schools often rely on brief clinical exposure to abortion during the obstetrics and gynecology clerkship to provide this learning. Abortion is also a highly politicized and stigmatized procedure. Given this potential conflict, we examine medical student reactions to their observation of abortion care. Study Design Medical students in their second and third years at an academic medical center who observed in a first trimester abortion clinic completed open-ended, written questionnaires. Questionnaires explored student reactions to participating in the abortion clinic. We used applied thematic analysis to code and qualitatively analyze 78 questionnaires. Results We identified the following five themes: (1) students found participating in abortion care deeply worthwhile, (2) some were challenged by their reactions, particularly when reactions conflicted with prior beliefs, (3) some demonstrated empathy for the patient, but (4) some expressed judgment of both the patient and the abortion provider, and (5) students reported a desire for curricular change around abortion education, requesting more time for reflection, and some felt that their abortion observation might better prepare them to serve future patients. Conclusions Observing in an abortion clinic is a valued experience that allows students to challenge their existing beliefs and may build empathy. Educators should provide students with adequate time for preparation and reflection around this topic and address areas of misunderstanding that may perpetuate abortion stigma. These findings may inform medical student curriculum changes around abortion.","2020","2021-02-15 21:50:00","2021-02-15 21:50:00","","353-358","","5","30","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For this purpose, we used an immersive reality treadmill equipment and developed a 3D avatar, with instantly modifiable parameters for knee flexion and extension (acceleration or deceleration). Fourteen healthy young adults, equipped with motion capture markers, were asked to walk at a self-selected pace on the treadmill. A real-time 3D image of their lower limbs was modelized and projected on the screen ahead of them, as if in a walking motion from left to right. The subjects were instructed to continue walking. When we initiated an increase in the knee flexion of the avatar, we observed a similar increase in the subjects' knee flexion. No significant results were observed when the modification involved a decrease in knee flexion. The results and their significance are discussed using theories encompassing empathy, sympathy and sensory re-calibration. The prospect of using this type of modified avatar for stroke rehabilitation is discussed.","2019","2021-02-15 21:50:14","2021-02-15 21:50:14","","e02797","","11","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Rehabilitation; Empathy; Neuroscience; Sympathy; Avatar; Adaptation; Biomedical engineering; Knee flexion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Also, there was no effect of agency on social presence, physical presence, social interaction anxiety and stress. Yet, participants showed significantly more social avoidance and prosocial behavior towards avatars.

Given the prevalence of computer-animated human characters and a narrative framework in videogames, serious games, and health-related scenarios, it is important to examine how the uncanny valley influences narrative empathy and enjoyment. In a 2 × 2 × 2 between-groups posttest-only experiment, 738 participants took the role of a patient in a virtual consultation with a doctor; the consultation varied in the doctor's character (hero or villain), its subplot ending (happy or tragic), and its depiction (computer animated or real). The participants' posttest results showed greater emotional empathy and enjoyment in the hero condition and no significant difference in emotional empathy for the computer animation but greater narrative enjoyment and persuasion. Just endings (hero rewarded, villain punished) elicited much greater pleasure than unjust endings. In comparing computer animation with recorded video, emotional empathy was a significantly stronger predictor of narrative enjoyment than transportation only for the real hero with a tragic ending. The enjoyment and persuasiveness of the computer-animated doctor–patient consultation bodes well for the use of animation in interactive visual narratives.","2019","2021-02-15 21:50:15","2021-02-15 21:50:15","","140-153","","","94","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Uncanny valley; Avatars; Anthropomorphism; Computer animation; Emotional empathy; Interactive narratives","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Still, explanations as to why slightly imperfect human-like characters can evoke feelings of eeriness remain the subject of controversy. Many experiments exploring the phenomenon have emphasized specific visual factors in connection to evolutionary psychological theories or an underlying categorization conflict. More recently, studies have also shifted away focus from the appearance of human-like entities, instead exploring their mental capabilities as basis for observers' discomfort. In order to advance this perspective, we introduced 92 participants to a virtual reality (VR) chat program and presented them with two digital characters engaged in an emotional and empathic dialogue. Using the same pre-recorded 3D scene, we manipulated the perceived control type of the depicted characters (human-controlled avatars vs. computer-controlled agents), as well as their alleged level of autonomy (scripted vs. self-directed actions). Statistical analyses revealed that participants experienced significantly stronger eeriness if they perceived the empathic characters to be autonomous artificial intelligences. As human likeness and attractiveness ratings did not result in significant group differences, we present our results as evidence for an “uncanny valley of mind“ that relies on the attribution of emotions and social cognition to non-human entities.

These games enable the parallel gaming of multiple users in online virtual worlds with or against each other via their graphical agent (avatar). Recent findings suggest online role-playing addicts to have a deficient self-concept. The latter's potential compensation by means of a higher identification with the own avatar might be an etiological factor in the development of an online role-playing game addiction. On a neurobiological level, especially the left Angular Gyrus (AG) seems to be associated with identification and empathy processes. An according fMRI-based study on long-term gamers of online role-playing games indicated increased brain activations in the left AG during the rating of personality traits referring to the avatar relative to self-referencing and the referencing of close others (Ganesh et al., 2011). However, the extent to which these results represent specific neurobiological mechanisms that are associated with self-concept deficits or a stronger identification with the own avatar in the development of online role-playing game addiction remains unknown to date. Methods N=16 addicted and n=17 regular gamers of online role-playing games (mean age=28 and 26 years, respectively) underwent functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) while 1) completing a Giessen-Test (GT)-derived paradigm assessing participants’ concepts of self, ideal and avatar and 2) while viewing and evaluating images of the own person, the own avatar as well as unknown persons. Additionally, a questionnaire referring to the own body image and a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for the evaluation of the own as well as avatar's attractiveness, sympathy and gender identity were applied. Results Addicts of online role-playing games rated their body image, gender identity and social response (i.e. social popularity) significantly lower. Neurobiologically, they showed increased left AG activations during the reflection about their avatar (relative to their ideal and/or their self) compared to non-addicted gamers. Furthermore, within-group differences revealed left AG response during the perception of images showing their avatar (relative to images of themselves). In addition, addicted gamers had hypoactivations in the bilateral AG during the perception of images of their own person compared to the perception of unknown persons. The left-lateral AG hypoactivation positively correlated with the degree of the gender identity. Discussion In line with previous findings, our results indicate self-concept deficits in online role-playing game addicts and a stronger identification with the own avatar, which might neurobiologically be reflected in AG activations. The results could point towards problems in the formation of an own identity as a cause for online role-playing game addiction development. Longitudinal studies may shed light on these potentially causal relations.","2015","2021-02-15 21:50:15","2021-02-15 21:50:15","","123","","","30","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Abstracts of the 23rd European Congress of Psychiatry</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Méthode Dans la perspective d’une ouverture théorique à la fois phénoménologique et psychanalytique, l’auto-empathie est le processus au cours duquel, en prenant la position de l’« autrui-en-soi », nous nous représentons notre monde subjectif – soit l’ensemble de nos états de subjectivité (actions, émotions, pensées) –, par relation empathique avec nous-mêmes. Cette relation d’auto-empathie correspond à une opération de distanciation, et d’appropriation symbolique, au cours de laquelle nous nous dédoublons, en mettant en œuvre notre faculté innée d’être à la fois sujet et objet pour nous-mêmes. Résultats La médiatisation de l’auto-empathie dans les mondes numériques permet de nous mettre à la place d’une figure qui nous représente – notre avatar –, de sorte que notre empathie est tournée vers nous-mêmes indirectement. Ce second temps d’empathie pour une figure virtuelle de soi, nommé « auto-empathie médiatisée » ou « auto-empathie virtuelle », favoriserait dans un troisième temps le développement d’une empathie pour soi. Enfin, le développement d’une empathie pour autrui serait soutenu dans un quatrième temps, par l’attention que les joueurs se portent les uns aux autres dans les jeux en réseau. Discussion Ces quatre hypothèses, illustrées par des cas cliniques, ouvrent une interrogation portant sur le cadre en psychanalyse. À l’adolescence, le travail de virtualisation, qui consiste en l’anticipation créatrice de ses possibilités subjectives, apparaît régulièrement contrarié. La duplicité psychique n’est plus à même d’opérer une distance symbolisante entre le soi réel et le soi virtuel, entre le soi subjectif et le soi subjectivant. L’autrui-en-soi est inefficace à proposer à l’adolescence un dialogue empathique avec soi-même. En conséquence, l’autoreprésentation flirte avec l’effondrement, en particulier dans les états de cassures subjectives. Or, les espaces numériques pourraient bien être pour l’adolescent des supports indirects d’appropriation d’expériences subjectives. Conclusion Nos réflexions ont conduit à penser l’auto-empathie comme la réalisation de l’autrui-en-soi qui permet de nous représenter notre propre monde subjectif. L’auto-empathie médiatisée par un avatar peut donc être décrite comme une représentation par empathie de notre part subjective contenue par ce personnage. Dès lors, l’espace du jeu vidéo se présente comme un espace de subjectivation. Objectives The authors propose to explore a psychic phenomenon, the “auto-empathy”, as implemented in the context of digital spaces and particularly in the situation of the player who embodies an avatar (a pixel figure) in a video game. Method From the perspective of a theoretical opening both phenomenological and psychoanalytic, auto-empathy is the process in which, taking the position of the “other-in-oneself”, we represent our subjective world – or the all states of our subjectivity (actions, emotions, thoughts) – by an empathic relationship with ourselves. The auto-empathy relationship is a process of distancing, and symbolic appropriation, in which we are divided into halves, implementing our innate ability to be both subject and object for ourselves. Results The mediatization of auto-empathy in digital worlds can put ourselves instead of a figure that represents us – our avatar – so that our empathy is turned towards ourselves indirectly. This second time of empathy for a virtual figure of the self, called “mediatized auto-empathy” or “virtual auto-empathy”, would contribute thirdly to the development of empathy for oneself. Finally, the development of empathy for others would be supported in a fourth time, by the attention the players are paying to each other in network games. Discussion These four hypotheses, illustrated by clinical cases, open an interrogation concerning the frame of the psychoanalytical work. In the adolescent, the work of virtualisation, which consists in the creative anticipation of its subjective possibilities, seems regularly impeded. The mental duplicity is no longer in a position to operate a symbolizing distance between the real self and the virtual self, between the subjective self and the subjectivising self. The other-in-oneself is ineffective in proposing to the adolescent an empathic dialogue with oneself. Consequently, the autorepresentation flirts with the seizure, in particular in the subjective states of breaks. Nevertheless, the digital spaces could be indirect media of appropriation of subjective experiences for the teenager. Conclusion Our reflections led us to think of auto-empathy as the realization of the other-in-oneself which allows us to represent our own subjective world. The auto-empathy mediatized by an avatar can thus be described as a representation by empathy of our subjective part that contains this character. From then on, the space of the video game appears as a space of subjectivation.","2016","2021-02-15 21:50:15","2021-02-15 21:50:15","","293-308","","2","81","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Empathy; Phenomenology; Auto-empathy; MMORPG; Video games; Others-in-oneself; Psychoanalysis; Reflexiveness; Subjectivation; Theoretical study; Auto-empathie; Autrui-en-soi; Empathie; Étude théorique; Jeu vidéo; Phénoménologie; Psychanalyse; Réflexivité","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Impairments of both empathic and visuo-spatial abilities have been observed in patients with schizophrenia. Especially, it has been suggested that schizophrenics are altered in spontaneously simulating another individual’s first-person experience. However, there is so far only little evidence regarding the relationship between deficits in empathy and disturbances in spontaneous heterocentered coding in schizophrenia. In the present pilot-study, we tested with schizophrenic patients our behavioural paradigm that enables to measure from the bodily postures and movements whether individuals in ecologically more valid conditions are interacting with another individual by using egocentered – as in sympathy (feeling with someone else) – or heterocentered – as in empathy – visuo-spatial mechanisms. For that, ten patients and ten controls, standing and moving, interacted with a virtual tightrope walker, displayed life-sized, standing and moving as well. We show that patients with higher negative symptoms had, in most cases, deficits in spontaneously using heterocentered visuo-spatial mechanisms and employed preferentially an egocentered referencing to interact with the avatar. In contrast, preserved spontaneous heterocentered visuo-spatial strategies were not linked to a prevailing negative or positive symptomatology. Our data suggest that the severity of the negative symptoms in schizophrenia relates with disturbances of spontaneous (“on-line”) empathic processing in association with lower scoring self-reported trait cognitive empathy.","2014","2021-02-15 21:50:15","2021-02-15 21:50:15","","87-99","","","90","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Negative symptoms; Schizophrenia; Empathy; Sympathy; Executive functions; Inhibitory processing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, via structural equation modelling (SEM) and semi-structured interviews with managers, we conceptualise and empirically test visitors' intentions to use social robots in hospitality services. With data collected in Singapore's hospitality settings, we found visitors' intentions to use social robots stem from the effects of technology acceptance variables, service quality dimensions leading to perceived value, and two further dimensions from human robot interaction (HRI): empathy and information sharing. Analysis of these dimensions' importance provides a deeper understanding of novel opportunities managers may take advantage of to position social robot-delivered services in tourism and hospitality strategies.","2020","2021-02-15 21:50:34","2021-02-15 21:50:34","","104042","","","78","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Artificial intelligence; Human-robot interaction; Hospitality services; Intention to use robots; Social robots","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
