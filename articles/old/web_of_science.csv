Each intervention was generated using a communicating bot. Participants exposed to these interventions were compared with a control group that received no intervention. The bot-generated normative communications (both the ones priming descriptive and the ones priming prescriptive norms), as well as the empathizing intervention, reduced the proportion of verbal aggression posted by Reddit accounts.

On the basis of evolution theory, we investigate the implicit psychological mechanisms that underlie consumers' interactions with medical AI and a human doctor. In a behavioral investigation (Study 1), consumers expressed a positive intention to use medical AI's healthcare services when it used personalized rather than mechanical conversation. However, neural investigation (Study 2) using functional magnetic resonance imaging revealed that some consumers' implicit attitudes toward medical AI differed from their expressed behavioral intentions. The brain areas linked with implicitly apathetic emotions were activated even when medical AI used a personalized conversation, whereas consumers' brains were activated in areas associated with prosociality when they interacted with a human doctor who used a personalized conversation. On the basis of our neural evidence, consumers perceive an identical personalized conversation differently when it is offered by a medical AI versus a human doctor. These findings have implications for the area of human-AI interactions and medical decision-making and suggest that replacing human doctors with medical AI is still an unrealistic proposition.","","2021-02-11 01:55:23","2021-02-11 01:55:23","","","","","","","Psychol.

Collectively, these have resulted in the modification of the physician's role as the gatekeeper for health care, increased shift-based care, and amplified interprofessional team-based care. Technological innovations present opportunities as well as challenges. Artificial intelligence, which has great potential, has already transformed some tasks, particularly those involving image interpretation. Ubiquitous access to information via the Internet by physicians and patients alike presents benefits as well as drawbacks: patients and providers have ready access to virtually all of human knowledge, but some websites are contaminated with misinformation and many people have difficulty differentiating between solid, evidence-based data and untruths. The role of the future physician will shift as complexity in health care increases and as artificial intelligence and other technologies advance. These technological advances demand new skills of physicians; memory and knowledge accumulation will diminish in importance while information management skills will become more important. In parallel, medical educators must enhance their teaching and assessment of critical human skills (e.g., clear communication, empathy) in the delivery of patient care. The authors emphasize the enduring role of critical human skills in safe and effective patient care even as medical practice is increasingly guided by artificial intelligence and related technology, and they suggest new and longitudinal ways of assessing essential noncognitive skills to meet the demands of the future. The authors envision practical and achievable benefits accruing to patients and providers if practitioners leverage technological advancements to facilitate the development of their critical human skills.","2021-01","2021-02-11 01:55:23","2021-02-11 01:55:23","","37-43","","1","96","","Acad.

Materials and Methods: Co-design workshops with general practitioners were conducted. The workshops focused on (1) understanding the current consultation context and identifying existing problems, (2) ideating future solutions to these problems, and (3) discussing future roles for Al in primary care. The workshop activities included affinity diagramming, brainwriting, and video prototyping methods. The workshops were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Inductive thematic analysis of the transcripts of conversations was performed. Results: Two researchers facilitated 3 co-design workshops with 16 general practitioners. Three main themes emerged: professional autonomy, human-AI collaboration, and new models of care. Major implications identified within these themes included (1) concerns with medico-legal aspects arising from constant recording and accessibility of full consultation records, (2) future consultations taking place out of the exam rooms in a distributed system involving empowered patients, (3) human conversation and empathy remaining the core tasks of doctors in any future AI-enabled consultations, and (4) questioning the current focus of AI initiatives on improved efficiency as opposed to patient care. Conclusions: AI documentation assistants will likely to be integral to the future primary care consultations. However, these technologies will still need to be supervised by a human until strong evidence for reliable autonomous performance is available. Therefore, different human-AI collaboration models will need to be designed and evaluated to ensure patient safety, quality of care, doctor safety, and doctor autonomy.","2020-11","2021-02-11 01:55:23","2021-02-11 01:55:23","","1695-1704","","11","27","","J.

The researchers aim to gather practical knowledge regarding tourists' intentions for such service enhancements, which may drive the sector to adopt a better conclusive growth pattern in post-COVID-19 times. In this study, we attempt to focus on travelers who look for paramount safety with the assurance of empathetic, personalized care in post-COVID-19 times. In the current study, the authors employ structural equation modeling to evaluate the intentions of tourists both structurally and empirically for destination tourism with data collected from tourists with previous exposure to various kinds of these devices. The study shows that human-machine interactive devices are integrating AI and VR and have a significant effect on overall service quality, leading to tourist satisfaction and loyalty. The use of such social interactive gadgets within tourism and mostly in hospitality services requires an organization to make a commitment to futuristic technologies, along with building value by enriching service quality expectations among fearful tourists. This research shows that tourists mainly focus on the use of such HMI devices from the perspective of technology acceptance factors, qualitative value-enhancing service and trustworthy information-sharing mechanisms. The concept of the tour bubble framework is also discussed in detail. The analysis of this discussion gives us a more profound understanding of the novel opportunities which various administrative agencies may benefit from to position these devices better in smart, sustainable destination tourism strategies for the future so that, collectively, service 5.0 with HMI devices can possibly bring back tourism from being disintegrated. Such service applications are the new social innovations leading to sustainable service and a sophisticated experience for all tourists.","2020-11","2021-02-11 01:55:23","2021-02-11 01:55:23","","9523","","22","12","","Sustainability","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Web of Science","","Place: Basel Publisher: Mdpi WOS:000594619200001","","C:\Users\esben\Zotero\storage\QERHBKY9\Van et al. - 2020 - The Role of Human-Machine Interactive Devices for .pdf","","","robots; empathy; 0 and 5; AI and VR devices; covid-19; experience; hospitality; information-technology; perceived value; reality; revival of tourism; robots in tourism; service; service 5; technology acceptance model; tour bubble; tourist interest; user acceptance; Web 4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The survey measured opinions about the likelihood future technology would fully replace physicians in performing ten key psychiatric tasks. This study involved qualitative descriptive analysis of written responses (""comments"") to three open-ended questions in the survey. Results Comments were classified into four major categories in relation to the impact of future technology on: (1) patient-psychiatrist interactions; (2) the quality of patient medical care; (3) the profession of psychiatry; and (4) health systems. Overwhelmingly, psychiatrists were skeptical that technology could replace human empathy. Many predicted that 'man and machine' would increasingly collaborate in undertaking clinical decisions, with mixed opinions about the benefits and harms of such an arrangement. Participants were optimistic that technology might improve efficiencies and access to care, and reduce costs. Ethical and regulatory considerations received limited attention. Conclusions This study presents timely information on psychiatrists' views about the scope of artificial intelligence and machine learning on psychiatric practice.

This paper presents the experience of one aspect of artificial intelligence, machine learning, coupled with patient empathy to improve utilization of assisted reproductive technology (ART), which is an important aspect of care that is under-recognized. Although ART provides very effective options for infertile patients to build families, patients often discontinue ART when further treatment is likely to be beneficial and most of these patients do not achieve pregnancy without medical aid. Use of ART is only in part dependent on financial considerations; stress and other factors play a major role, as shown by high discontinuation rates despite reimbursement.

We investigated pain experiences when observing three different facial expressions of a virtual agent modeling affective minds (i.e., painful, unhappy, and neutral). The cold pain detection threshold of 19 healthy subjects was measured as they watched a black screen, then changes in their cold pain detection thresholds were evaluated as they watched the facial expressions. Subjects were asked to rate the pain intensity from the respective facial expressions. Changes of cold pain detection thresholds were compared and adjusted by the respective pain intensities. Only when watching the painful expression of a virtual agent did, the cold pain detection threshold increase significantly.

By taking a first-person perspective, in contrast to most prior research that has taken a third-person perspective, the problem is framed in a personal way that allows identification of a mechanism of responsibility attribution. In this commentary, a generalized framework is developed in which we can locate the work of Gill (2020), as well as prior research that uses moral dilemmas, to understand how consumers believe that AVs should respond when faced with competing life-and-death alternatives. The framework shows the distinct positions that research to date has adopted, points out gaps in research, and suggests a family of four research agendas that can be pursued going forward, driven in large part by the perspective taken to the moral dilemma. Research employing these different perspectives, including the unresearched problem of taking the perspective of the object, holds promise for using moral dilemmas for enabling our understanding of consumer experience and consumer-object relationships with AVs.","2020-08","2021-02-11 01:55:23","2021-02-11 01:55:23","","292-300","","2","47","","J.

Here we present our progress toward building artificial agents with such abilities. We implemented a perspective taking task inspired by experiments done with chimpanzees. We show that agents controlled by artificial neural networks can learn via reinforcement learning to pass simple tests that require some aspects of perspective taking capabilities. We studied whether this ability is more readily learned by agents with information encoded in allocentric or egocentric form for both their visual perception and motor actions.

However, a proper integration of IHRs requires a detailed description and explanation of their essential capabilities, particularly regarding their competencies in replicating and portraying emotive functions such as empathy. Existing humanoid robots can exhibit rudimentary forms of empathy; as these machines slowly become commonplace in healthcare settings, they will be expected to express empathy as a natural function, rather than merely to portray artificial empathy as a replication of human empathy. This article works with a twofold purpose: firstly, to consider the impact of artificial empathy in nursing and, secondly, to describe the influence of Affective Developmental Robotics (ADR) in anticipation of the empathic behaviour presented by artificial humanoid robots. The ADR has demonstrated that it can be one means by which humanoid nurse robots can achieve expressions of more relatable artificial empathy.

Some researchers have argued that AI will augment the capacities of physicians and increase their availability to provide empathy and other uniquely human forms of care to their patients. The human vulnerabilities experienced in the healthcare context raise the stakes of new technologies such as AI, and the human dimensions of AI in healthcare have particular significance for research in the humanities. This article explains four key areas of concern relating to AI and the role that medical/health humanities research can play in addressing them: definition and regulation of ""medical"" versus ""health"" data and apps; social determinants of health; narrative medicine; and technological mediation of care. Issues include data privacy and trust, flawed datasets and algorithmic bias, racial discrimination, and the rhetoric of humanism and disability. Through a discussion of potential humanities contributions to these emerging intersections with AI, this article will suggest future scholarly directions for the field.","","2021-02-11 01:55:23","2021-02-11 01:55:23","","","","","","","J.

Machine learning is dramatically changing scientific research and industry and may also hold promise for addressing limitations encountered in mental health care and psychotherapy. The current paper introduces machine learning and natural language processing as related methodologies that may prove valuable for automating the assessment of meaningful aspects of treatment. Prediction of therapeutic alliance from session recordings is used as a case in point. Recordings from 1,235 sessions of 386 clients seen by 40 therapists at a university counseling center were processed using automatic speech recognition software. Machine learning algorithms learned associations between client ratings of therapeutic alliance exclusively from session linguistic content. Using a portion of the data to train the model, machine learning algorithms modestly predicted alliance ratings from session content in an independent test set (Spearman's rho =15, p <.001). These results highlight the potential to harness natural language processing and machine learning to predict a key psychotherapy process variable that is relatively distal from linguistic content. Six practical suggestions for conducting psychotherapy research using machine learning are presented along with several directions for future research. Questions of dissemination and implementation may be particularly important to explore as machine learning improves in its ability to automate assessment of psychotherapy process and outcome.","2020-07","2021-02-11 01:55:23","2021-02-11 01:55:23","","438-448","","4","67","","J.

Using various sensors, precise displays and high computing powers smartphone are becoming devices that make the boost in technology. Now it is necessary to efficiently use various sensors without affecting system operation and improve control abilities for various purposes. Especially in practical applications received by mass users such as games and any kind of experience. In this article, we propose a system that allows to extend the perception of the virtual world by conveying information about the user's movements in reality into the supervised model. The system retrieves data from several sources, quickly analyzes them using artificial intelligence techniques, and returns information to the mobile phone about the activity that is being processed. The concept extends the understanding of today's virtual reality by allowing the user to move and perform simple gestures in a specially designed room. Moreover, we propose multiplayer mode in virtual reality, where players are in different places. The proposed architecture of the system has been tested on simple applications, and the results show high potential for implementations in various apps by achieving almost 90% efficiency in changing player direction in real time and only 7.5% of collision cases.

The empirical understanding of the drivers of visitors' intentions to use robots in such services has become an urgent necessity for their sustainable deployment. Certainly, using social androids within hospitality services requires organisations' attentive commitment to value creation and fulfilling service quality expectations. In this paper, via structural equation modelling (SEM) and semi-structured interviews with managers, we conceptualise and empirically test visitors' intentions to use social robots in hospitality services. With data collected in Singapore's hospitality settings, we found visitors' intentions to use social robots stem from the effects of technology acceptance variables, service quality dimensions leading to perceived value, and two further dimensions from human robot interaction (HRI): empathy and information sharing. Analysis of these dimensions' importance provides a deeper understanding of novel opportunities managers may take advantage of to position social robot-delivered services in tourism and hospitality strategies.","2020-06","2021-02-11 01:55:23","2021-02-11 01:55:23","","104042","","","78","","Tourism Manage.","Leveraging human-robot interaction in hospitality services","","","","","","","English","","","","","Web of Science","","Place: Oxford Publisher: Elsevier Sci Ltd WOS:000514750800008","","","","","Artificial intelligence; gender; engagement; Human-robot interaction; Hospitality services; Intention to use robots; Social robots; future; health; perceptions; experience; reality; technology acceptance model; tourism; satisfaction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, I argue that the AI rights research program is beset by an epistemic problem that threatens to impede its progress-namely, a lack of a solution to the 'Hard Problem' of consciousness: the problem of explaining why certain brain states give rise to experience. To motivate this claim, I consider three ways in which to ground AI rights-namely: superintelligence, empathy, and a capacity for consciousness. I argue that appeals to superintelligence and empathy are problematic, and that consciousness should be our central focus, as in the case of animal rights. However, I also argue that AI rights is disanalogous from animal rights in an important respect: animal rights can proceed without a solution to the 'Hard Problem' of consciousness. Not so with AI rights, I argue. There we cannot make the same kinds of assumptions that we do about animal consciousness, since we still do not understand why brain states give rise to conscious mental states in humans.","","2021-02-11 01:55:23","2021-02-11 01:55:23","","","","","","","AI Soc.","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Web of Science","","Place: New York Publisher: Springer WOS:000536422900003","","C:\Users\esben\Zotero\storage\FTCTTH4Z\Andreotta - The hard problem of AI rights.pdf","","","Ethics; Artificial intelligence; AI rights; Animals rights; The 'hard   problem' of consciousness","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This article analyzes the impact of strategic stability of the use of AI in the strategic decision-making process, in particular, the risks and trade-offs of pre-delegating military force (or automating escalation) to machines. It argues that AI-enabled decision support tools, by substituting the role of human critical thinking, empathy, creativity, and intuition in the strategic decision-making process, will be fundamentally destabilizing if defense planners come to view AI's 'support' function as a panacea for the cognitive fallibilities and human analysis and decision-making. The article also considers the nefarious use of AI-enhanced fake news, deepfakes, bots, and other forms of social media by non-state actors and state proxy actors, which might cause states to exaggerate a threat from ambiguous or manipulated information, increasing instability.","","2021-02-11 01:55:23","2021-02-11 01:55:23","","","","","","","J.

In this work, we aim to examine AI roles in early design stages. The human ideation components and design tools related to AI are discussed in a framework of AI-augmented design support. The framework develops a hierarchy of design cognition (basis), approaches and principles. The cognitive models are constructed in an empirical study of 30 designers (26 for analysis, 4 for pilot study) by concurrent Think-Aloud protocol and behavior analysis. The process of producing new design ideas is explained by a transparent analysis of designers' language and behaviors. Three strategies to organize cognitive activities in design ideation are summarized: develop structured consideration, relate to a scenario, and stick-to designing. These strategies suggest AI could act as (1) representation creation, (2) empathy trigger and (3) engagement, in principles of ""knowledge-driven"" and ""decompose-and-integrate"". The design support with AI provides new perspectives on computer-based design tools that limit to well-defined design variables. The framework is built on a generic notion of design activity and ""mimic"" human design rationales, expected to benefit research of domain-independent computational design supports and cognitive supports.","2020-11-01","2021-02-11 01:55:23","2021-02-11 01:55:23","","511-544","","5-6","35","","Hum.-Comput.

The epistemological approach helps us to clarify whether we can empathize with artificial intelligence or, more precisely, with social robots. The main puzzle here concerns, among other things, exactly what it is that we empathize with if robots do not have emotions or beliefs, since they do not have a consciousness in an elaborate sense. However, by comparing robots with fictional characters, the paper shows that we can still empathize with robots and that many of the existing accounts of empathy and mindreading are compatible with such a view. By so doing, the paper focuses on the significance of perspective-taking and claims that we also ascribe to robots something like a perspectival experience. The normative approach examines the moral impact of empathizing with robots. In this regard, the paper critically discusses three possible responses: strategic, anti-barbarizational, and pragmatist. The latter position is defended by stressing that we are increasingly compelled to interact with robots in a shared world and that to take robots into our moral consideration should be seen as an integral part of our self- and other-understanding.","2020-12","2021-02-11 01:55:23","2021-02-11 01:55:23","","881-897","","4","11","","Rev.

In recent years, the quest for greater efficiency in health care, including economic efficiency, has often resulted in the side-lining of these values, making it difficult for health-care professionals to incorporate them in practice. Artificial intelligence is increasingly being used in health care. This technology promises greater efficiency and more free time for health-care professionals to focus on the human side of care, including fostering trust relationships and engaging with patients with empathy and compassion. This article considers the vision of efficient, empathetic and trustworthy health care put forward by the proponents of artificial intelligence. The paper suggests that artificial intelligence has the potential to fundamentally alter the way in which empathy, compassion and trust are currently regarded and practised in health care. Moving forward, it is important to re-evaluate whether and how these values could be incorporated and practised within a health-care system where artificial intelligence is increasingly used. Most importantly, society needs to re-examine what kind of health care it ought to promote.","2020-04","2021-02-11 01:55:23","2021-02-11 01:55:23","","245-250","","4","98","","Bull.

Part II describes how AI is transforming what it means to provide legal services in six primary areas: litigation review; expertise automation; legal research; contract analytics; contract and litigation document generation; and predictive analytics. Part III explores who are the providers of these AI driven legal services - often non-lawyer legal service providers - and how these providers are replacing at least some of what clients have traditionally sought from lawyers. Part III also discusses the implications of all these changes both for the future role of lawyers individually, and in particular what services will clients still need lawyers to perform: judgment, empathy, creativity and adaptability. In turn, this Part examines what will these changes mean for the size, shape, composition and economic model of law firms, as well as the implications of these changes for legal education and lawyer training. Part IV identifies the principal legal, ethical, regulatory and risk management issues raised by the use of AI in the provision of legal services.

Mental health appears ripe for such disruption given the global illness burden, stigma, and shortage of care providers. Objective: To characterize the global psychiatrist community's opinion regarding the potential of future autonomous technology (referred to here as AI/ML) to replace key tasks carried out in mental health practice. Design: Cross sectional, random stratified sample of psychiatrists registered with Sermo, a global networking platform open to verified and licensed physicians. Main outcome measures: We measured opinions about the likelihood that AI/ML tools would be able to fully replace - not just assist - the average psychiatrist in performing 10 key psychiatric tasks. Among those who considered replacement likely, we measured opinions about how many years from now such a capacity might emerge. We also measured psychiatrist's perceptions about whether benefits of AI/ML would outweigh the risks. Results: Survey respondents were 791 psychiatrists from 22 countries representing North America, South America, Europe and Asia-Pacific. Only 3.8 % of respondents felt it was likely that future technology would make their jobs obsolete and only 17 % felt that future AI/ML was likely to replace a human clinician for providing empathetic care. Documenting and updating medical records (75 %) and synthesizing information (54 %) were the two tasks where a majority predicted that AI/ML could fully replace human psychiatrists. Female- and US-based doctors were more uncertain that the benefits of AI would outweigh risks than male- and non-US doctors, respectively. Around one in 2 psychiatrists did however predict that their jobs would be substantially changed by AI/ML. Conclusions: Our findings provide compelling insights into how physicians think about AI/ML which in turn may help us better integrate technology and reskill doctors to enhance mental health care.","2020-01","2021-02-11 01:55:23","2021-02-11 01:55:23","","101753","","","102","","Artif.

This article presents a new framework, the 3S Process, as a method for teaching leaders how to strategically adopt AI within their organizations. At a high-level, the 3S Process consists of three stages (Story, Strategy, and Solution), which are described in detail in the article. Stage 1: Story in the process is inspired by the Harvard Case Method to provide context for a problem. Stage 2: Strategy uses Design Thinking to produce candidate solutions. The substage of Empathy in Design Thinking plays a crucial role to reduce bias in designing AI. Virtualization technology is a tool for students to experience hands-on learning in prototype development. Stage 3: Solution is where students advocate for their conceptual AI solution in the context of the case study. AI is a type of complex system; therefore, students should consider feedback loops and the potential for unintended biases to enter a deployed solution. The presentation of the 3S Process in this article is conceptual. Further empirical studies, including evaluations of the 3S Process in classroom settings, will be considered in the future.","2019-12","2021-02-11 01:55:23","2021-02-11 01:55:23","","36-42","","12","9","","Technol.

Although this promises to deliver increased speed and accuracy, the future role of AI in relation to radiotherapy should be thought through carefully. There is currently a gap between published developments and widespread adoption, which provides some space to prepare the workforce and to consider the implications on practice. It is rare to find philosophical input into a medical journal, but the advent of AI makes this perspective increasingly important. Philosophical insight can help explore the potential impact of AI, in particular, on human creativity and oversight. Without this perspective, we run the risk of focusing solely on the immediate logistical impact on patients and departments. This commentary identifies three key aspects of radiotherapy that the authors feel would suffer most under AI control: creativity, innovation, and patient safety, which all demand uniquely human attributes. The article also provides insight from a philosophical perspective with regard to human consciousness, ethics, and empathy. Philosophically we should, perhaps, retain ethical concerns about the widening role of AI in radiotherapy beyond simple quantitative interpretation and image processing. As developments continue, we have time to determine how our roles will evolve and to establish a framework for ensuring appropriate human input into patient care. Most importantly, we must start to embed a philosophical approach to adoption of AI technology from the outset if we are to prepare ourselves for the challenge that lies ahead.","2019-12","2021-02-11 01:55:23","2021-02-11 01:55:23","","S27-S31","","4","50","","J.

One such problem of particular importance is the low accuracy of predictions. This paper suggests that users' help is a practical approach to improve accuracy and it considers four factors that trigger users' willingness to help for an imperfect AI system. The two factors covered in Study 1 are utilitarian benefit based on egoistic motivation, and empathy based on altruistic motivation. In Study 2, utilitarian benefit is divided into explainable AI and monetary reward. The results indicate that two variables, namely empathy and monetary reward, have significant positive effects on willingness to help, and monetary reward is the strongest stimulus. In addition, explainable AI is shown to be positively associated with trust in AI. This study applies social studies of help motivation to the HCI field in order to induce users' willingness to help for an imperfect AI. The triggers of help motivation, empathy and monetary reward, can be utilized to induce the users' voluntary engagement in the loop with an imperfect AI.","2019-12","2021-02-11 01:55:23","2021-02-11 01:55:23","","180-196","","","101","","Comput.

However, the traditional use of didactic lectures for communication skills training is ineffective, and the use of standardized patients is not time- or cost-effective. Given the abilities of virtual patients (VPs) to simulate interactive and authentic clinical scenarios in secured environments with unlimited training attempts, a virtual counseling application is an ideal platform for nursing students to hone their communication skills before their clinical postings. Objective: The aim of this study was to develop and test the use of VPs to better prepare nursing undergraduates for communicating with real-life patients, their family members, and other health care professionals during their clinical postings. Methods: The stages of the creation of VPs included preparation, design, and development, followed by a testing phase before the official implementation. An initial voice chatbot was trained using a natural language processing engine, Google Cloud's Dialogflow, and was later visualized into a three-dimensional (3D) avatar form using Unity 3D. Results: The VPs included four case scenarios that were congruent with the nursing undergraduates' semesters' learning objectives: (1) assessing the pain experienced by a pregnant woman, (2) taking the history of a depressed patient, (3) escalating a bleeding episode of a postoperative patient to a physician, and (4) showing empathy to a stressed-out fellow final-year nursing student. Challenges arose in terms of content development, technological limitations, and expectations management, which can be resolved by contingency planning, open communication, constant program updates, refinement, and training. Conclusions: The creation of VPs to assist in nursing students' communication skills training may provide authentic learning environments that enhance students' perceived self-efficacy and confidence in effective communication skills. However, given the infancy stage of this project, further refinement and constant enhancements are needed to train the VPs to simulate real-life conversations before the official implementation.","2019-10-29","2021-02-11 01:55:23","2021-02-11 01:55:23","","e14658","","10","21","","J.

A useful thought experiment is the application of the Turing test to user-facing artificial intelligence systems in health care. In this paper I argue that many medical decisions require value judgements and the doctor-patient relationship requires empathy and understanding to arrive at a shared decision, often handling large areas of uncertainty and balancing competing risks. Arguably, medicine requires wisdom more than intelligence, artificial or otherwise. Artificial intelligence therefore needs to supplement rather than replace medical professionals, and identifying the complementary positioning of artificial intelligence in medical consultation is a key challenge for the future. In health care, artificial intelligence needs to pass the implementation game, not the imitation game.","2019-10-28","2021-02-11 01:55:23","2021-02-11 01:55:23","","e16222","","10","21","","J. Med.

Curtis","An Essay on Narrative, Reality, and Imagination","Psychoanalytic Inquiry","","0735-1690","10.1080/07351690.2019.1659025","","Narrative is a verbal account, a story of related events which can be factual, fictional or both. Life experience and imagination are as essential to narrative as narrative is to mankind. The phylogenic perspective of literature suggests an inborn capacity for empathy, intelligence and inventiveness, whereas the ontological example is variable. Western knowledge, politics and ethics have evolved from their narrative of Greek myth, epic and drama, the few medieval writers, singularly by the Elizabethan theater, importantly the Arthurian legend and romance stories, English and Russian novels, and uniquely the American short story. This heritage progressively demarcated such life themes as the hero, maiden and adversary; love, hate and indifference; loyalty, deception and betrayal; desire, achievement and loss. These characterizations of self and other remain relevant to the contemporary novel, cinema/TV, and theater, as well as the news, commentary, and real life. Conversely, postmodern assumptions challenge that individual subjectivity determines what is real, valid or authentic, consequently the relativism of traditional, institutional and historical precedents of the truth. Further, the computer, gaming, smart device, and artificial intelligence have changed the content and function of customary narrative. Nonetheless, narrative ? real and imagined, ancient and new ? retains the meaning of a story about connected events which variously transcends the boundaries of difference.","2019-10-03","2021-02-11 01:55:23","2021-02-11 01:55:23","","476-484","","7","39","","Psychoanal.

Facing challenges wrought by science and technology as well as societal change, the curriculum is increasingly out of synch with new needs in teaching content and medical practice. The path to significant curricular reform is difficult because of a variety of factors, including deeply entrenched values, the natural resistance to change, and the accreditation process. Indeed, even the very definition of what it means to be a professional is changing with profound implications for the future role of the physician and the sacrosanct doctor-patient relationship. In this Invited Commentary, the author enumerates challenges facing medical education in the current era. To address these challenges, the author recommends specific curricular emphases for 21st-century medical education: knowledge capture and curation, collaboration with and management of artificial intelligence applications, a deep understanding of probabilistic reasoning, and the cultivation of empathy and compassion in accordance with ethical standards. Given these needs, it is imperative that schools act today to undertake significant curricular reform and, in so doing, strive to make the hard changes necessary to produce optimal practitioners in a rapidly transforming 21st century. The author provides first steps an institution can take to begin to address these challenges.","2019-10","2021-02-11 01:55:23","2021-02-11 01:55:23","","1412-1415","","10","94","","Acad.

Similar to the amygdala, the instantaneous emergency emotion is first computed more quickly in a low-redundancy convolutional neural network compressed by pruning and weight sharing with hashing trick. Then, the real-time process emotion is identified more accurately by the memory level neural networks, which is good at handling time-related signals. Finally, the intracranial emotion is recognized in personalized hidden Markov models.

BACKGROUND: Meaningful recognition positively impacts nursing and organizational outcomes. The use of AI techniques such as natural language processing andmachine learning to identify and describe behaviors impacting patient experiences is an emerging science. METHODS: Nurse recognition comments were collected from a convenience sample of 3 organizations via an IPC inpatient platform and analyzed using the AI techniques of natural language processing, machine learning, sentiment analytics, and corollary dictionaries based on rules of linguistics. RESULTS: The top theme of nursing recognition comments was courtesy and respect with the behaviors of empathy/compassion, helpfulness, kindness, attentiveness, and emotional comfort. The theme of skills/knowledge was the 2nd most common, with the behaviors of being professional, knowledgeable, keeping track, competence, dedication, and being thorough. CONCLUSIONS: AI techniques for qualitative analysis of comments collected through IPC reveal nurse themes and behaviors most meaningful to patients and their family members.

Objective: This study aimed to explore general practitioners' (GPs') opinions about the potential impact of future technology on key tasks in primary care. Methods: In June 2018, we conducted a Web-based survey of 720 UK GPs' opinions about the likelihood of future technology to fully replace GPs in performing 6 key primary care tasks, and, if respondents considered replacement for a particular task likely, to estimate how soon the technological capacity might emerge. This study involved qualitative descriptive analysis of written responses (""comments"") to an open-ended question in the survey. Results: Comments were classified into 3 major categories in relation to primary care: (1) limitations of future technology, (2) potential benefits of future technology, and (3) social and ethical concerns. Perceived limitations included the beliefs that communication and empathy are exclusively human competencies; many GPs also considered clinical reasoning and the ability to provide value-based care as necessitating physicians' judgments. Perceived benefits of technology included expectations about improved efficiencies, in particular with respect to the reduction of administrative burdens on physicians. Social and ethical concerns encompassed multiple, divergent themes including the need to train more doctors to overcome workforce shortfalls and misgivings about the acceptability of future technology to patients. However, some GPs believed that the failure to adopt technological innovations could incur harms to both patients and physicians. Conclusions: This study presents timely information on physicians' views about the scope of artificial intelligence (AI) in primary care. Overwhelmingly, GPs considered the potential of AI to be limited. These views differ from the predictions of biomedical informaticians. More extensive, stand-alone qualitative work would provide a more in-depth understanding of GPs' views.","2019-03-20","2021-02-11 01:55:23","2021-02-11 01:55:23","","e12802","","3","21","","J. Med.

The system is inspired by advances in biosensing wearables, tattoo displays, brain sensors, robotic agents, artificial intelligence (Al), gestural interaction and 3D holographic displays. By 2030, technological advances will enable us to prototype and investigate questions related to experiential and embodied emotional learning; emotion-based human-computer interaction, affective biosensing, empathetic Al agents, and 3D interactive holographic environments. We envision EmotoTent as a modular, emotion sensing Holodeck. In the EmotoTent program children learn and practice emotion regulation and empathy with peers, pets and a robotic dog agent in ways that are experiential, embodied and playful. We propose EmotoTent as a core element of a K-6 socio-emotional learning curriculum designed to improve school culture through the enhancement of children's ability to regulate emotions and interact with human and non-human species with empathy and compassion. Enhancing these qualities has been shown to lead to reductions in violence and bullying, racism, gender inequality and other forms of marginalization. We predict that the EmotoTent socio-emotional learning program will improve school cultures and create a foundation for children's lifelong well-being.","2019","2021-02-11 01:55:23","2021-02-11 01:55:23","","","","","","","","EmotoTent","","","","","Assoc Computing Machinery","New York","English","","","","","Web of Science","","DOI: 10.1145/3311927.3326596 Pages: 755-760 Publication Title: Proceedings of Acm Interaction Design and Children (idc 2019) WOS:000559055100103","","","","","biosensing; children; embodied learning; Empathy; experiential learning; holographic environments; robotic agents; mind-body   interaction; tangible user-interface","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are given increasingly sensitive and impactful roles in society, it is important to enable AI to wield empathy as a tool to benefit those it interacts with. In this paper, we work towards this goal by bringing together a number of important concepts: empathy, AI planning, and plan recognition (i.e., the problem of inferring an actor's plan and goal given observations about its behavior). We formalize the notions of Empathetic Planning and Empathetic Plan Recognition which are informed by the beliefs and affective state of the actor, and propose AI planning-based computational approaches. We illustrate the benefits of our approach by conducting a study with human participants.","2019","2021-02-11 01:55:23","2021-02-11 01:55:23","","","","","","","","","","","","","Assoc Computing Machinery","New York","English","","","","","Web of Science","","DOI: 10.1145/3306618.3314307 Pages: 525-526 Publication Title: Aies '19: Proceedings of the 2019 Aaai/Acm Conference on Ai, Ethics, and Society WOS:000556121100074","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There is also a growing awareness of the importance of inclusive education and, as a consequence, the need to comply with accessibility requirements regarding web contents and web interface (WCAG). These requirements are also supported by specific laws in most countries. But such awareness does not yet reach the interfaces of conversational agents or chatbots that are being developed. Within the framework of the European project ACACIA, co-funded by the Erasmus+ program of the European Union, Artemisa, a chatbot has been created dedicated to fight against sexual harassment and search for volunteers to promote the acceptance of diversity and tolerance, has been created using a platform that facilitates the generation and management of this type of artificial intelligences. But to what extent Artemisa is an accessible chatbot or not? Is it ethically acceptable to make use of a tool that is intended to support inclusiveness but presents accessibility barriers to some users? What is the current state in terms of accessibility compliance of chatbots that work on social networks? This article seeks to answer this and other questions related to accessibility in Chatbots, conversational agents and virtual assistant's. Based on the answer to these questions it follows that there is a need for training in interculturalism and web accessibility to combat the biases that present such entities, which are endowed with artificial intelligence and, unfortunately, in some cases causing serious damage to some people.","2019","2021-02-11 01:55:38","2021-02-11 01:55:38","","8824-8833","","","","","","","","","","","Iated-Int Assoc Technology Education & Development","Valenica","English","","","","","Web of Science","","ISSN: 2340-1117 WOS:000553304903063","","","","","artificial intelligence; ethics; empathy; Conversational agents; accessibility; biases; Chatbot","Chova, L.

Major depression is associated with impaired psychosocial functioning and reduced quality of life. Challenges such as shortage of mental health personnel, long waiting times, perceived stigma, and lower government spends pose barriers to the alleviation of mental health problems. Face-to-face psychotherapy alone provides only point-in-time support and cannot scale quickly enough to address this growing global public health challenge. Artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled, empathetic, and evidence-driven conversational mobile app technologies could play an active role in filling this gap by increasing adoption and enabling reach. Although such a technology can help manage these barriers, they should never replace time with a health care professional for more severe mental health problems. However, app technologies could act as a supplementary or intermediate support system. Mobile mental well-being apps need to uphold privacy and foster both short- and long-term positive outcomes. Objective: This study aimed to present a preliminary real-world data evaluation of the effectiveness and engagement levels of an AI-enabled, empathetic, text-based conversational mobile mental well-being app, Wysa, on users with self-reported symptoms of depression. Methods: In the study, a group of anonymous global users were observed who voluntarily installed the Wysa app, engaged in text-based messaging, and self-reported symptoms of depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. On the basis of the extent of app usage on and between 2 consecutive screening time points, 2 distinct groups of users (high users and low users) emerged. The study used mixed-methods approach to evaluate the impact and engagement levels among these users. The quantitative analysis measured the app impact by comparing the average improvement in symptoms of depression between high and low users. The qualitative analysis measured the app engagement and experience by analyzing in-app user feedback and evaluated the performance of a machine learning classifier to detect user objections during conversations. Results: The average mood improvement (ie, difference in pre- and post-self-reported depression scores) between the groups (ie, high vs low users; n=108 and n=21, respectively) revealed that the high users group had significantly higher average improvement (mean 5.84 [SD 6.66]) compared with the low users group (mean 3.52 [SD 6.15]); Mann-Whitney P=.03 and with a moderate effect size of 0.63. Moreover, 67.7% of user-provided feedback responses found the app experience helpful and encouraging. Conclusions: The real-world data evaluation findings on the effectiveness and engagement levels of Wysa app on users with self-reported symptoms of depression show promise. However, further work is required to validate these initial findings in much larger samples and across longer periods.","2018-11","2021-02-11 01:55:38","2021-02-11 01:55:38","","e12106","","11","6","","JMIR mHealth uHealth","An Empathy-Driven, Conversational Artificial Intelligence Agent (Wysa) for Digital Mental Well-Being","","","","","","","English","","","","","Web of Science","","Place: Toronto Publisher: Jmir Publications, Inc WOS:000451080100001","","C:\Users\esben\Zotero\storage\A2T23INZ\Inkster et al. - 2018 - An Empathy-Driven, Conversational Artificial Intel.pdf","","","resilience; artificial intelligence; emotions; depression; psychotherapy; empathy; conversational agents; mental health; anxiety disorders; chatbots; coping skills; depressive symptoms; efficacy; guided-self-help; health; individual participant data; metaanalysis; mHealth; primary-care; psychological; randomized controlled-trials","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In fact, not only is it becoming apparent that quantum processes may regularly take place in biological systems, but these processes may underlie the mechanisms of consciousness and propel our models of conceptualizing the human brain into the next era of scientific understanding. The phenomena of consciousness have allured scientists and philosophers for thousands of years, while a precise technical understanding has remained elusive. If possible, developing this understanding will likely be one of humanity's greatest achievements. Knowing the fundamental processes that create conscious experience has far-reaching implications, from the potential birth of true artificial intelligence to a better understanding of mental health disorder etiologies and treatments. One major challenge in the mental health professions, and, ultimately, in empathy of any kind, is being able to see from and appreciate another person's unique, subjective experience.

Although age per se is not a good predictor for ICU survival it frequently comes along with several comorbidities influencing not only ICU but also one to five year survival as well as quality of life compared to a matched non-post-ICU population. Therefore, risk stratification among others seeking for signs of frailty in addition to the development of instruments in order to estimate the post-ICU quality of life are important in order to perform a sound risk-benefit analysis. For patients at risk scheduled for a major intervention pre-interventional interdisciplinary case analysis and discussion including patient and next of kin is warranted. Moreover, aged patients are at risk for under and overtreatment why clear written strategies adapted to the individual case have to be established. With regard to the development of more and more advanced treatment options in patients who finally cannot be cured a change of paradigm concerning palliative care is urgently needed. In these situations palliative care should not be seen as treatment option in the last days only but as accompanying support as soon as it is recognized that cure is not possible. This allows the patient to discuss and establish an advanced care planning together with the care givers. Major challenges in the very near future result from advances in personalized medicine (including genetic analysis) and from digital transformations of our societies. Both are closely connected and will change modern medicine within the next 15 years entirely. Expert systems with artificial intelligence and robots will support but also confront health care professionals with their limitations and hopefully remind them that medicine is not only science but also art and that the digital world at least for a while cannot provide clinical judgment, empathy and humanity as good as human beings.","2017-07","2021-02-11 01:55:38","2021-02-11 01:55:38","","25-31","","2","74","","Ther.

In the future, we may face a different but related problem: that we might create (or cause the creation of) beings that not only satisfy but exceed these criteria. The question becomes whether these are minimal criteria, or hierarchical, such that those who fulfill them to greater degree should be afforded greater consideration. This article questions the validity and necessity of drawing divisions among beings that satisfy the minimum requirements for personhood; considering how future beings-intelligent androids, synthezoids, even alternate-substrate sentiences-might fit alongside the ""baseline"" human. I ask whether these alternate beings ought to be considered different to us, and why this may or may not matter in terms of a notion of ""human community."" The film Blade Runner, concerned in large part with humanity and its key synthezoid antagonist Roy Batty, forms a framing touchstone for my discussion. Batty is stronger, faster, more resilient, and more intelligent than Homo sapiens. His exploits, far beyond the capability of normal humans, are contrasted with his frailty and transient lifespan, his aesthetic appreciation of the sights he has seen, and his burgeoning empathy.

A transformer set-up forms the central element in transmitting and distributing power. There is heavy transmission loss if the power system is defective. The transformers should be protected from internal faults and magnetic inrush currents. The power demands for a biomedical research center or hospital are higher and need to be consistent for the working of all biomedical equipments used. This paper proposes transient detection techniques using Wavelet transform (WT). The advantage of WT is that, it can represent current and voltage signals. Empathy of transients is very fast and precise so this work tends to elaborate on a new wavelet method to classify the inrush currents from power system disturbances. The classification problems in Artificial Intelligence (AI) are solved using neural networks. The neural networks derive its inspiration from neurons present in human body. The performance of NN is assessed based on the design of the hidden layers and by evaluating the weights that connect the nodes. There are no modifications made to the design of the hidden layers as the weight calculated is more important than the hidden structure. An optimum solution can be obtained by calculating the weights of NN by decreasing the function cost or error. This work aims to propose a modified neural network. The neural networks are trained using Firefly Algorithm (FA). Since this protocol is a simple and an efficient metaheuristic optimization technique which draws inspiration from fireflies which tend to move towards brighter light.

One hundred and seventy-two participants with a wide range of music playing backgrounds rated sound recordings of 7 performances of piano music by Kuhlau, one played by a human, and six generated by algorithms, including a mechanical' and an unmusical' rendering. Participants rated the extent to which each performance was by a human and explained their answers. The mechanical performance had the lowest mean rating, but the human performance was rated as statistically identical to the other stimuli. There were no differences between ratings made by classical piano experts and lay listeners, but despite this, the musicians were more confident with their ratings. Qualitative analysis revealed five broad themes that contribute to judging whether a piece appears to be human. The themes were labelled (in descending order of frequency) intuitive, expressive, imperfections, halo (global preference) and empathy. This paper presents new evidence systematically demonstrating that algorithm generated performances of piano music can be indistinguishable from human performances, suggesting some parallels with the 1990s victory of the Deep Blue computer of the world champion (human) chess player.","2017","2021-02-11 01:55:38","2021-02-11 01:55:38","","175-186","","2","46","","J.

This new revolution brings new paradigms that is breaking the way men work, and, consequently, changes in their training will also be necessary due to differences in knowledge and skills needed to meet new job demands. A fundamental characteristic of this new mode of production is multidisciplinary teams with a high level of technical knowledge and the ability to face several aspects of the production system, from production line up to customer interaction and integration with business and corporative systems. Besides, due to the velocity of transformations, the new employees must be able to learn and change quickly. Furthermore, such workers must develop intrinsically human characteristics like empathy, personal relationship and technical skills that machines won't be able to do, since all other activities would be done by machines with artificial intelligence and advanced robotics. This paper proposes the use of pedagogical robotics in order to develop multidisciplinary ability and development of interpersonal relationships, creativity and critical thinking to the future employees.

First Results of Human Perceptions of Emotional Intelligence in Humans Compared to Robots","Intelligent Virtual Agents, Iva 2017","978-3-319-67401-8 978-3-319-67400-1","","","","Humans are very apt at reading emotional signals in other humans and even artificial agents, which raises the question of whether artificial agents need to be emotionally intelligent to ensure effective social interactions. For artificial agents without emotional intelligence might generate behavior that is misinterpreted, unexpected, and confusing to humans, violating human expectations and possibly causing emotional harm. Surprisingly, there is a dearth of investigations aimed at understanding the extent to which artificial agents need emotional intelligence for successful interactions. Here, we present the first study in the perception of emotional intelligence (EI) in robots vs. humans. The objective was to determine whether people viewed robots as more or less emotionally intelligent when exhibiting similar behaviors as humans, and to investigate which verbal and nonverbal communication methods were most crucial for human observational judgments. Study participants were shown a scene in which either a robot or a human behaved with either high or low empathy, and then they were asked to evaluate the agent's emotional intelligence and trustworthiness. The results showed that participants could consistently distinguish the high EI condition from the low EI condition regardless of the variations in which communication methods were observed, and that whether the agent was a robot or human had no effect on the perception. We also found that relative to low EI high EI conditions led to greater trust in the agent, which implies that we must design robots to be emotionally intelligent if we wish for users to trust them.","2017","2021-02-11 01:55:38","2021-02-11 01:55:38","","129-141","","","10498","","","Do We Need Emotionally Intelligent Artificial Agents?","","","","","Springer International Publishing Ag","Cham","English","","","","","Web of Science","","DOI: 10.1007/978-3-319-67401-8_15 ISSN: 0302-9743 WOS:000455400000015","","","","","automation; emotional intelligence; trust; Human-robot interaction; performance; climate; empathetic robot; workplace","Beskow, J.; Peters, C.; Castellano, G.; OSullivan, C.; Leite, I.; Kopp, S.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An understanding of emotional interactions would be essential to such robots' behavior. To improve the cognitive and behavior systems of such robots, we propose the use of an artificial topological consciousness that uses a synthetic neurotransmitter and motivation, including a biologically inspired emotion system. A fundamental aspect of a companion robot is a cross communication system that enables natural interactions between humans and the robot. This paper focuses on three points in the development of our proposed framework: (1) the organization of the behavior including inside-state emotion regarding the phylogenetic consciousness-based architecture; (2) a method whereby the robot can have empathy toward its human user's expressions of emotion; and (3) a method that enables the robot to select a facial expression in response to the human user, providing instant human-like 'emotion' and based on emotional intelligence (El) that uses a biologically inspired topological online method to express, for example, encouragement or being delighted. We also demonstrate the performance of the artificial consciousness based on the complexity level and a robot's social expressions that are designed to enhance the users affinity with the robot.

There is an ongoing effort to find a HIP that is secure enough yet easy for humans. Recently, a new HIP has been designed aiming at higher security: the Civil Rights Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart (CAPTCHA). It employs the empathy capacity of humans to further strengthen Securimage, a well-known text CAPTCHA. In this paper, we analyze it from a security perspective, finding fundamental design flaws. Using several well-known machine learning (ML) algorithms, we analyze to what extent these flaws affect its security. We discover that thanks to them, we can create a successful side-channel attack. This attack is able to correctly solve the HIP on 20.7% of occasions, much more than enough to consider it broken. Thus, we show that there is no need to solve the problem of optical character recognition nor empathy analysis for computers to break this particular HIP. ML can be successfully used to break a HIP that uses both with a side-channel attack. This security analysis can be applied to other HIPs. It will allow to test whether they are leaking too much information by unexpected ways, given non-evident design flaws.

In the present paper we present an experiment in which the relationship between empathy and spatial perspective Berthoz and Jorland (L'Empathie, 2004) acquires a significant role in the process of structural coupling Maturana and Varela (The tree of knowledge: the biological roots of human understanding, 1992) and Damiano (UnitA in dialogo. Un nuovo stile per la conoscenza, 2009). The concept of empathy in education is at the basis of the relation between teacher and students and between teaching and learning. Thus the concepts of co-activity Vinatier and Numa-Bocage (Revue fran double dagger aise de p,dagogie, 158:85-101, 2007) and of structural coupling have analogies with empathy and can provide operational indications. The research question is the following: is it possible to detect the presence of a structural coupling and of empathic processes in a class of students and their teachers through the mediation of a conceptual space created by an automated AI system? The present contribution analyses the use of an AI plug-in developed within the European project I-TUTOR. In the experiment the artefact plays the role of mediator between the teacher and the students and lets their different perspectives be compared. The artefact does not engage in dialogue with the student in a one-to-one relationship, but it is a vertex of the student-artefact-teacher triangle. The artefact, an automated space, fosters a comparison between the perspective of the student and that of the teacher in relation to the dominant teaching object of the course. The paper describes the findings of the experiment run with two groups of students and proposes some changes to be worked into the plug-in to foster further empathic processes.","2015-02","2021-02-11 01:55:38","2021-02-11 01:55:38","","103-109","","1","7","","Int.

This is a common scenario in modern computer games, where players interact with NPCs assuming the guise of human characters. To explore this question, an online game was developed in which a human player had a primary objective of surviving against increasingly difficult waves of enemies. As a secondary objective, the player was tasked with protecting an unarmed NPC companion which assumed either a human, or non-human identity, but with identical underlying Artificial Intelligence. The intention was to explore whether the human player would be more or less protective of a synthetic companion simply due to the identity assumed. The results of the study demonstrate that player's behavior does change based on identity, and clearly indicates that the player was more protective of the companion assuming a human identity. Furthermore, the results show that this phenomenon extends beyond simple human and non-human identities, and that the specific persona, or gender of the NPC may influence the player's empathy towards it.","2015","2021-02-11 01:55:38","2021-02-11 01:55:38","","","","","","","","","","","","","Ieee","New York","English","","","","","Web of Science","","DOI: 10.1109/CW.2015.35 Pages: 145-152 Publication Title: 2015 International Conference on Cyberworlds (cw) WOS:000380483300024","","","","","behavior; embodiment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite the production of different computational models, their integration with cognitive and psychological theories remains a central problem. Reasons are both methodological and theoretical. Primarily, it is difficult to quantify the impact of such factors as individual differences, inclinations and personality traits. In addition, Agent-Based Models (ABMs) often use linear dynamics, even in describing emotions, without considering the basis of psychophysics.

The parameters governing the robotised elements we propose are mainly qualitative (emotions and aesthetical perception), which cannot easily be described by mathematical parameters. Additionally, due to their complexity, it is often impossible - or at least impractical, to hardcode suitable controllers for such structures. Thus, we propose the use of Artificial Intelligence learning techniques, concretely Evolutionary Algorithms, to allow the user to teach the robotised components how to behave in response to their resemblance to specific animal behaviors.

We assume that generalised states of the world are valuable - not rewards themselves, and propose an extension of AIXI, in which rewards are used only to bootstrap hierarchical value learning. The modified AIXI agent is considered in the multi-agent environment, where other agents can be either humans or other 'mature' agents, the values of which should be revealed and adopted by the 'infant' AGI agent. Ageneral framework for designing such empathic agent with ethical bias is proposed as an extension of the universal intelligence model as well.

On the basis of evolution theory, we investigate the implicit psychological mechanisms that underlie consumers' interactions with medical AI and a human doctor. In a behavioral investigation (Study 1), consumers expressed a positive intention to use medical AI's healthcare services when it used personalized rather than mechanical conversation. However, neural investigation (Study 2) using functional magnetic resonance imaging revealed that some consumers' implicit attitudes toward medical AI differed from their expressed behavioral intentions. The brain areas linked with implicitly apathetic emotions were activated even when medical AI used a personalized conversation, whereas consumers' brains were activated in areas associated with prosociality when they interacted with a human doctor who used a personalized conversation. On the basis of our neural evidence, consumers perceive an identical personalized conversation differently when it is offered by a medical AI versus a human doctor. These findings have implications for the area of human-AI interactions and medical decision-making and suggest that replacing human doctors with medical AI is still an unrealistic proposition.","","2021-02-11 03:48:10","2021-02-11 03:48:10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article; Early Access","","","","","fMRI; artificial intelligence; personalization; apathy; consumer neuroscience; prosociality; medical decision-making","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Prosocial games are games focusing on helping others. Game researchers have been keen to investigate factors that influence the immersive experience in digital games. Previous studies show that VR allows people to take the perspective of others, inducing empathy and prosocial behaviour in the real world. In this lab-based study, we explore whether and how taking the perspective of other game characters - NPCs in a prosocial VR game - influences players' in-game empathy towards NPCs and game immersion. Participants first experienced either a robot's perspective of being destroyed by fire in VR or read a text description about the same event. Then, they participated a prosocial VR game in which they saved robots. The findings show that perspective-taking experiences indirectly enhance participants' game immersion via the effects of closeness with the destroyed robot and empathy towards the four robots protected by the player. This indirect effect is moderated by players' weekly exposure to video games. These results suggest that VR-based perspective-taking of NPCs can indirectly enhance gameplay experiences in prosocial VR games. Theoretical and game design implications are discussed.","","2021-02-11 03:48:10","2021-02-11 03:48:10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND Publisher: TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD Type: Article; Early Access","","","","","empathy; virtual reality; digital games; Perspective taking; prosocial games","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This brain activity is further modulated by lowand high-order factors, e.g., the perceived intensity of the model's pain and the model's similarity with the onlooker, respectively. We investigated which specific aspect of similarity modulates such empathic reactivity, focusing on the potential differentiation between visual similarity and psychological closeness between the onlooker and different types of models. To this aim, we recorded fMRI data in neurotypical participants who observed painful and tactile stimuli delivered to an adult human hand, a baby human hand, a puppy dog paw, and an anthropomorphic robotic hand. The interaction between type of vicarious experience (pain, touch) and nature of model (adult, baby, dog, robot) showed that the right supramarginal gyrus (rSMG) was selectively active for visual similarity (more active during vicarious pain for the adult and baby models), while the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) was more sensitive to psychological closeness (specifically linked to vicarious pain for the baby model). These findings indicate that visual similarity and psychological closeness between onlooker and model differentially affect the activity of brain regions specifically implied in encoding interindividual sharing of sensorimotor and affective aspects of vicarious pain, respectively.

The Anthropomorphism of Animal Epimeletic Behaviours","ANIMALS","","2076-2615","10.3390/ani10122323","","Simple Summary Anthropomorphism, defined as attributing human traits to animals and other entities, seems to have appeared during evolution to improve an individual's understanding of other species (or indeed the world in general). Yet anthropomorphism can have beneficial or harmful consequences especially for animals, and there seems to be little interest in monitoring the potential danger of this approach. Few studies have focused on the factors affecting how we attribute intentions or beliefs to animals, and more quantitative studies are needed to identify how and why humans attribute mental states and cognitive abilities to other animals. In this study, participants answer questions about three videos in which an individual (a sparrow, an elephant and a macaque, respectively) displayed behaviours towards an inanimate conspecific that suddenly regained consciousness at the end of the footage. A fourth video showed a robot dog being kicked by an engineer to demonstrate its stability. These questions were designed to measure how far participants attribute humanlike intentions, beliefs or mental states to non-human animals and robots. Men and older participants are less likely to attribute humanlike mental states to animals. Similarly, people who work with animals or have at least one pet at home demonstrated less naive anthropomorphism. Conversely, we found that members of animal protection associations showed more biophilia (affinity for other living organisms), attributed more intentions and mental states to animals and were further from biological reality (current scientific knowledge of each species) than non-members. Understanding the potential usefulness of these factors can lead to better relationships with animals and encourage human-robot interactions. Anthropomorphism is a natural tendency in humans, but it is also influenced by many characteristics of the observer (the human) and the observed entity (here, the animal species). This study asked participants to complete an online questionnaire about three videos showing epimeletic behaviours in three animal species. In the videos, an individual (a sparrow, an elephant and a macaque, respectively) displayed behaviours towards an inanimate conspecific that suddenly regained consciousness at the end of the footage. A fourth video showed a robot dog being kicked by an engineer to demonstrate its stability. Each video was followed by a series of questions designed to evaluate the degree of anthropomorphism of participants, from mentaphobia (no attribution of intentions and beliefs, whatever the animal species) to full anthropomorphism (full attribution of intentions and beliefs by animals, to the same extent as in humans) and to measure how far the participants had correctly assessed each situation in terms of biological reality (current scientific knowledge of each species). There is a negative correlation (about 61%) between the mental states attributed to animals by humans and the real capability of animals. The heterogeneity of responses proved that humans display different forms of anthropomorphism, from rejecting all emotional or intentional states in animals to considering animals to show the same intentions as humans. However, the scores participants attributed to animals differed according to the species shown in the video and to human socio-demographic characteristics. Understanding the potential usefulness of these factors can lead to better relationships with animals and encourage a positive view of human-robot interactions. Indeed, reflective or critical anthropomorphism can increase our humanity.","2020-12","2021-02-11 03:48:10","2021-02-11 03:48:10","","","","12","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND Publisher: MDPI Type: Article","","","","","empathy; robot; animal ethics; birds; cognitive biases; comparative thanatology; elephants; mentaphobia; primates","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In human social interaction, the facial expression serves important communicative functions. We examined whether a robot's face is similarly important in human-robot communication. Based on emotion research and neuropsychological insights on the parallel processing of emotions, we argue that greater plasticity in the robot's face elicits higher affective responsivity, more closely resembling human-to-human responsiveness than a more static face. We conducted a between-subjects experiment of 3 (facial plasticity: human vs. facially flexible robot vs. facially static robot) x 2 (treatment: affectionate vs. maltreated). Participants (N = 265; M-age = 31.5) were measured for their emotional responsiveness, empathy, and attribution of feelings to the robot. Results showed empathically and emotionally less intensive responsivity toward the robots than toward the human but followed similar patterns. Significantly different intensities of feelings and attributions (e.g., pain upon maltreatment) followed facial articulacy. Theoretical implications for underlying processes in human-robot communication are discussed. We theorize that precedence of emotion and affect over cognitive reflection, which are processed in parallel, triggers the experience of `because I feel, I believe it's real,' despite being aware of communicating with a robot. By evoking emotional responsiveness, the cognitive awareness of `it is just a robot' fades into the background and appears not relevant anymore.","2020-12","2021-02-11 03:48:11","2021-02-11 03:48:11","","","","4","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND Publisher: MDPI Type: Article","","","","","empathy; social robots; facial expression; experiment; human-robot communication; user response","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The proposed model continuously detects the affective states of a user based on facial expressions and generates desired, either parallel or reactive, empathic behaviors that are already adapted to the user's personality. Users' affective states are detected using a stacked autoencoder network that is trained and tested on the RAVDESS dataset. The overall proposed empathic model is verified throughout an experiment, where different emotions are triggered in participants and then empathic behaviors are applied based on proposed hypothesis. The results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed model in terms of related social and friendship concepts that participants perceived during interaction with the robot.","2020-11","2021-02-11 03:48:11","2021-02-11 03:48:11","","","","3, SI","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 2 PENN PLAZA, STE 701, NEW YORK, NY 10121-0701 USA Publisher: ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY Type: Article","","","","","Empathy; social robots; human robot interaction; adaptive interaction; facial emotion detection; non-verbal behavior","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The researchers aim to gather practical knowledge regarding tourists' intentions for such service enhancements, which may drive the sector to adopt a better conclusive growth pattern in post-COVID-19 times. In this study, we attempt to focus on travelers who look for paramount safety with the assurance of empathetic, personalized care in post-COVID-19 times. In the current study, the authors employ structural equation modeling to evaluate the intentions of tourists both structurally and empirically for destination tourism with data collected from tourists with previous exposure to various kinds of these devices. The study shows that human-machine interactive devices are integrating AI and VR and have a significant effect on overall service quality, leading to tourist satisfaction and loyalty. The use of such social interactive gadgets within tourism and mostly in hospitality services requires an organization to make a commitment to futuristic technologies, along with building value by enriching service quality expectations among fearful tourists. This research shows that tourists mainly focus on the use of such HMI devices from the perspective of technology acceptance factors, qualitative value-enhancing service and trustworthy information-sharing mechanisms. The concept of the tour bubble framework is also discussed in detail. The analysis of this discussion gives us a more profound understanding of the novel opportunities which various administrative agencies may benefit from to position these devices better in smart, sustainable destination tourism strategies for the future so that, collectively, service 5.0 with HMI devices can possibly bring back tourism from being disintegrated. Such service applications are the new social innovations leading to sustainable service and a sophisticated experience for all tourists.","2020-11","2021-02-11 03:48:11","2021-02-11 03:48:11","","","","22","12","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND Publisher: MDPI Type: Article","","","","","COVID-19; 0 and 5; AI and VR devices; revival of tourism; robots in tourism; service 5; tour bubble; tourist interest; Web 4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using the paradigm of actor-perceiver, where the child was the actor and the robot or the human the perceiver, we recorded the autonomic heart rate activation and reported emotional feelings of ASD children in both countries. Japanese and French ASD children showed different interpersonal synchronisation when they interacted with the human perceiver, even though the human was the same in both countries. However, they exhibited similar interpersonal synchronisation when the perceiver was the robot. The findings suggest that the mechanism combining interpersonal synchronisation and emotional empathy might be weakened but not absent in ASD children and that both French and Japanese ASD children do spontaneously and unconsciously discern non verbal actions of non human partners through a direct matching process that occurs via automatic mapping.","2020-10-15","2021-02-11 03:48:11","2021-02-11 03:48:11","","","","1","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY Publisher: NATURE RESEARCH Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Additionally, to learn and apply the correct behaviors, robots must be able to perceive and understand the affective states of humans. This study presents a framework to enable cognitive empathy in social robots, which uses facial emotion recognition to perceive and understand the affective states of human users. The perceived affective state is then provided to a reinforcement learning model to enable a robot to learn the most appropriate empathic behaviors for different states. The proposed framework has been evaluated through an experiment between 28 individual humans and the humanoid robot Pepper.

When this dyad is completed, mind attribution towards intentionally harmed liminal minds is enhanced. However, from a dehumanisation view, malevolent actions may instead result in a denial of humanness. To contrast both accounts, a visual vignette experiment (N = 253) depicted either malevolent or benevolent intentions towards robotic or human avatars. Additionally, we examined the role of harm-salience by showing patients as either harmed, or still unharmed. The results revealed significantly increased mind attribution towards visibly harmed patients, mediated by perceived pain and expressed empathy. Benevolent and malevolent intentions were evaluated respectively as morally right or wrong, but their impact on the patient was diminished for the robotic avatar. Contrary to dehumanisation predictions, our manipulation of intentions failed to affect mind perception. Nonetheless, benevolent intentions reduced dehumanisation of the patients. Moreover, when pain and empathy were statistically controlled, the effect of intentions on mind perception was mediated by dehumanisation. These findings suggest that perceived intentions might only be indirectly tied to mind perception, and that their role may be better understood when additionally accounting for empathy and dehumanisation.","","2021-02-11 03:48:12","2021-02-11 03:48:12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: THE ATRIUM, SOUTHERN GATE, CHICHESTER PO19 8SQ, W SUSSEX, ENGLAND Publisher: JOHN WILEY & SONS LTD Type: Article; Early Access","","","","","Robots; Benevolent intentions; Dehumanisation; Mind perception; Moral typecasting theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, the aim is to find out if social robots with empathetic voice are acceptable for users in healthcare applications. A pilot study using an empathetic voice spoken by a voice actor was conducted. Only prosody in speech is used to express empathy here, without any visual cues. Also, the emotions needed for an empathetic voice are identified. It was found that the emotions needed are not only the stronger primary emotions, but also the nuanced secondary emotions. These emotions are then synthesised using prosody modelling. A second study, replicating the pilot test is conducted using the synthesised voices to investigate if empathy is perceived from the synthetic voice as well. This paper reports the modelling and synthesises of an empathetic voice, and experimentally shows that people prefer empathetic voice for healthcare robots. The results can be further used to develop empathetic social robots, that can improve people's acceptance of social robots.","","2021-02-11 03:48:12","2021-02-11 03:48:12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article; Early Access","","","","","Social robots; Artificial empathy; Emotional speech synthesis; Healthcare; Prosody modelling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The cold pain detection threshold of 19 healthy subjects was measured as they watched a black screen, then changes in their cold pain detection thresholds were evaluated as they watched the facial expressions.

The study proposes a new theoretical conceptual model that includes new constructs and items, differentiating it from the others. The model was formed based on the extensive literature review and the interview with an eight-member focus group (hotel managers and academic researchers). Data collection was performed in two stages, pilot research based on 82 respondents and the main study, with the final number of respondents being 236. The initial results of the exploratory factor analysis were further tested using the confirmatory factor analysis. After the exclusion of several items due to low factor loadings and in order to improve model validity, analyses further suggested a nine-dimensional solution with 45 items. The study findings reveal a positive relationship between seven constructs and students' willingness to implement service robots, with the expected business outcome being the most influencing one. On the other hand, positive relation was not found for empathy and social influence constructs. Theoretical contributions and practical implications are discussed in the paper. In conclusion, study limitations and future research suggestions are provided.","2020-09","2021-02-11 03:48:12","2021-02-11 03:48:12","","","","9","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND Publisher: MDPI Type: Article","","","","","students; hospitality; service robots; tourism; willingness to implement service robots","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study explores the service quality provided by robots based on real data in a hotel setting. A sample of 201 guests provided their expected service quality by robots and the actual performance experience after the service. We analyzed this relationship using importance performance analysis (IPA) and the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). The results revealed that customers' top priorities for robots' service quality are assurance and reliability, while tangible and empathy were not as important.

However, a proper integration of IHRs requires a detailed description and explanation of their essential capabilities, particularly regarding their competencies in replicating and portraying emotive functions such as empathy. Existing humanoid robots can exhibit rudimentary forms of empathy; as these machines slowly become commonplace in healthcare settings, they will be expected to express empathy as a natural function, rather than merely to portray artificial empathy as a replication of human empathy. This article works with a twofold purpose: firstly, to consider the impact of artificial empathy in nursing and, secondly, to describe the influence of Affective Developmental Robotics (ADR) in anticipation of the empathic behaviour presented by artificial humanoid robots. The ADR has demonstrated that it can be one means by which humanoid nurse robots can achieve expressions of more relatable artificial empathy. This will be one of the vital models for intelligent humanoid robots currently in nurse robot development for the healthcare industry. A discussion of IHRs demonstrating artificial empathy is critical to nursing practice today, particularly in healthcare settings dense with technology.","2020-10","2021-02-11 03:48:13","2021-02-11 03:48:13","","","","4","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article","","","","","artificial intelligence; affective developmental robotics; artificial empathy; humanoid nurse robots; intelligent humanoid robots; nursing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Dick'sDo androids dream of electric sheep?","NEOHELICON","","0324-4652","10.1007/s11059-020-00544-z","","The official definition for alexithymia dates back to 1973, when Sifneos described its symptoms. Persons affected by this condition are unable to verbally describe their feelings. For many years this condition was relatively little known, but nowadays people are talking about it more and more. In forums in which the patients' comments are posted, it is often underscored how this particular mental state is similar to that of the androids described in the novelDo androids dream of electric sheep? by Philip K. Dick. The Dickian clinical references were those in use during the 1960s. Therefore, to special characteristics that Philip Dick attributed to his robots (coldness and lack of human empathy, and simultaneous desire for social acceptance), the writer, and then the critics, assigned the label of schizophrenia, the only one that the psychiatric manuals of that time associated to such symptoms. Today, if Dick were alive and were to write about his androids, he most likely would no longer use the term schizophrenics, but instead the term alexithymics, which are more socially adaptive than schizophrenics, just like his androids. Making retrospective diagnoses of literary characters is anachronistic; as it was done for decades by critics to consider the Dickian androids schizophrenics: in the fiction story they are not schizophrenics but robots. However a new psychological trait such as alexithymia can revisit that same story by giving it a new symbolic meaning. The aims of this article are: to highlight how the old nosological categories of schizophrenia, generally referred to when commentingDo androids dream of electric sheep?, should be supplemented by the category of alexithymia; to analyze the scenes in which the characters have typical alexithymic behaviors, trying to prove that alexithymia is actually best suited for describing the androids invented by Dick.","2020-12","2021-02-11 03:48:13","2021-02-11 03:48:13","","673-683","","2, SI","47","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article","","","","","Schizophrenia; Affective disorders; Alexithymia; Dick; Do androids dream of electric sheep?; Philip K","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To fully exploit the application of a social robot as a psychometric tool, it is necessary to account for the users' factors that might influence the interaction with a robot and the evaluation of user cognitive performance. To this end, we invited senior participants to use a prototype of a robot-led cognitive test and analyzed the influence of personality traits and user's empathy on the cognitive performance and technology acceptance.

The empirical understanding of the drivers of visitors' intentions to use robots in such services has become an urgent necessity for their sustainable deployment. Certainly, using social androids within hospitality services requires organisations' attentive commitment to value creation and fulfilling service quality expectations. In this paper, via structural equation modelling (SEM) and semi-structured interviews with managers, we conceptualise and empirically test visitors' intentions to use social robots in hospitality services. With data collected in Singapore's hospitality settings, we found visitors' intentions to use social robots stem from the effects of technology acceptance variables, service quality dimensions leading to perceived value, and two further dimensions from human robot interaction (HRI): empathy and information sharing. Analysis of these dimensions' importance provides a deeper understanding of novel opportunities managers may take advantage of to position social robot-delivered services in tourism and hospitality strategies.","2020-06","2021-02-11 03:48:13","2021-02-11 03:48:13","","","","","78","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND Publisher: ELSEVIER SCI LTD Type: Article","","","","","Artificial intelligence; Human-robot interaction; Hospitality services; Intention to use robots; Social robots","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, I argue that the AI rights research program is beset by an epistemic problem that threatens to impede its progress-namely, a lack of a solution to the `Hard Problem' of consciousness: the problem of explaining why certain brain states give rise to experience. To motivate this claim, I consider three ways in which to ground AI rights-namely: superintelligence, empathy, and a capacity for consciousness. I argue that appeals to superintelligence and empathy are problematic, and that consciousness should be our central focus, as in the case of animal rights. However, I also argue that AI rights is disanalogous from animal rights in an important respect: animal rights can proceed without a solution to the `Hard Problem' of consciousness. Not so with AI rights, I argue. There we cannot make the same kinds of assumptions that we do about animal consciousness, since we still do not understand why brain states give rise to conscious mental states in humans.","","2021-02-11 03:48:13","2021-02-11 03:48:13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article; Early Access","","","","","Ethics; Artificial intelligence; AI rights; Animals rights; The `hard problem' of consciousness","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The epistemological approach helps us to clarify whether we can empathize with artificial intelligence or, more precisely, with social robots. The main puzzle here concerns, among other things, exactly what it is that we empathize with if robots do not have emotions or beliefs, since they do not have a consciousness in an elaborate sense. However, by comparing robots with fictional characters, the paper shows that we can still empathize with robots and that many of the existing accounts of empathy and mindreading are compatible with such a view. By so doing, the paper focuses on the significance of perspective-taking and claims that we also ascribe to robots something like a perspectival experience. The normative approach examines the moral impact of empathizing with robots. In this regard, the paper critically discusses three possible responses: strategic, anti-barbarizational, and pragmatist. The latter position is defended by stressing that we are increasingly compelled to interact with robots in a shared world and that to take robots into our moral consideration should be seen as an integral part of our self- and other-understanding.","2020-12","2021-02-11 03:48:14","2021-02-11 03:48:14","","881-897","","4","11","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article","","","","","Ethics; Artificial intelligence; Empathy; Fictional characters; Humanoid robots; Interaction; Perspective-taking","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Socially-assistive robots (SAR) have been used to reduce pain and distress in children in medical settings. Patients who perceive empathic treatment have increased satisfaction and improved outcomes. We sought to determine if an empathic SAR could be developed and used to decrease pain and fear associated with peripheral IV placement in children. Methods. We conducted a pilot study of children receiving IV placement. Participating children were randomized to interact with (1) no robot, or a commercially available 3D printed humanoid SAR robot programmed with (2) empathy or (3) distraction conditions. Children and parents completed demographic surveys, and children used an adapted validated questionnaire to rate the robot's empathy on an 8-point Likert scale. Survey scores were compared by the t-test or chi-square test. Pain and fear were measured by self-report using the FACES and FEAR scales, and video tapes were coded using the CHEOPS and FLACC. Scores were compared using repeated measures 2-way ANOVA. This trial is registered with . Results. Thirty-one children with an average age of 9.6 years completed the study. For all measures, mean pain and fear scores were lowest in the empathy group immediately before and after IV placement. Children were more likely to attribute characteristics of empathy to the empathic condition (Likert score 7.24 v. 4.70; p=0.012) and to report that having the empathic vs. distraction robot made the IV hurt less (7.45 vs. 4.88; p=0.026). Conclusions. Children were able to identify SAR designed to display empathic characteristics and reported it helped with IV insertion pain and fear. Mean scores of self-reported or objective pain and fear scales were the lowest in the empathy group and the highest in the distraction condition before and after IV insertion. This result suggests empathy improves SAR functionality when used for painful medical procedures and informs future research into SAR for pain management.","2020-04-09","2021-02-11 03:48:14","2021-02-11 03:48:14","","","","","2020","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND Publisher: HINDAWI LTD Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It provides a way to increase our understanding of the link between affective and cognitive processes and enhance our interaction with artificial agents. However, the variety of fields contributing to empathy research has resulted in isolated approaches to modeling empathy, and this has led to various definitions of empathy and an absence of common ground regarding underlying empathic processes. Although this diversity may be useful in that it allows for an in-depth examination of various processes linked to empathy, it also may not yet provide a coherent theoretical picture of empathy. We argue that a clear theoretical positioning is required for collective progress. The aim of this article is, therefore, to call for a holistic and multilayered view of a model of empathy, taken from the rich background research from various disciplines. To achieve this, we present a comprehensive background on the theoretical foundations, followed by the working definitions, components, and models of empathy that are proposed by various fields. Following this introduction, we provide a detailed review of the existing techniques used in AI research to model empathy in interactive agents, focusing on the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. We conclude with a discussion of future directions in this emerging field.","2020-04","2021-02-11 03:48:14","2021-02-11 03:48:14","","2983-3006","","4","53","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article","","","","","Empathy; Affective computing; Artificial agents; Cognitive modeling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper we investigated the interplay between trust in a robot and people's perceptions of the robot's emotional intelligence. We used a vignette-based method to explore the following questions: (1) Do subjects perceive differences in robot EI, and is their trust in the robot influenced by differences in the robot's reliability and capability? (2) Does a robot's EI influence how much it is trusted and conversely does a robot's capability and reliability influence how emotionally intelligent it is perceived to be? (3) Do people trust male and female robots differently when the robots exhibit different levels of EI or different levels of capability and reliability, and do gender stereotypical expectations related to EI transfer to trust?; (4) Does focusing on the robot's EI increase one's trust in the robot? (5) Is the interplay between trust, EI and gender the same for different levels of evoked social presence and human-likeness (i.e., when the interaction is presented in different modalities, text or spoken dialogue when the robot's voice is actually heard)? We found that trust in the robot was influenced by the level of the robot's EI (p < .001) and that gender stereotypical expectations related to EI were transferred to trust (p = .006), but gender effects on trust disappeared when only capability and reliability (robot's trustworthiness) were manipulated but not the robot's EI (p = .103). Surprisingly, we found that people trusted the robot more when the interaction was presented in text format (p = .024), going against our hypothesis that spoken dialogue would evoke more social presence and thus bolster EI perception and instill more trust. We suggest that this effect might be due to people's expectations of a more expressive and human-like voice. Finally, we also found that people's trust ratings in the robot were higher when they were made to notice and think about the robot's EI, by answering EI questionnaires prior to trust questionnaires (p = .022). We discuss the implications of our findings for robot design and HRI research.","","2021-02-11 03:48:14","2021-02-11 03:48:14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article; Early Access","","","","","Human-robot interaction; Trust; Emotional intelligence; Gender","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of such projects, of which the DREAM project is an example, is to replace therapists by robots, operating in sensory environments that enable them to detect and respond to feedback from the child. This article considers the ethical concerns of autonomy, community, transparency, identity, value, and empathy to evaluate the ethics of such deployment of robots. In doing so it provides a response to the Richardson et al. article in IEEE Technology and Society Magazine, Mar. 2018 [20]. This article concludes that deployment of robots to control the behavior of autistic children is ethically suspect and should be questioned. The use of robots with children should be evaluated on the basis of the purpose of and process by which such robots are deployed, rather than on the basis of the technology itself. Particularly important is the roboticist's empathy with the user of the robot, and gaining an understanding of the individual child. The paper suggests how an understanding of the autistic child might lead to sensitive deployment of a robot to help the child manage social environments through supporting the child's regulation of emotions.","2020-03","2021-02-11 03:48:14","2021-02-11 03:48:14","","51-60","","1","39","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA Publisher: IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC Type: Article","","","","","Medical treatment; Ethics; Robot sensing systems; Autism; Pediatrics; Social implications of technology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we illustrate the use of the PWoz interaction method as well as how it helps identify engaging robot interactions. Using this technique, we present results from a study with 62 teens that includes details of the complexity of teen stress and a significant reduction in negative attitudes toward robots after interactions. We analyzed the teens' interactions with both the verbal and non-verbal robots and identified strong themes of (1) authenticity, (2) empathy, (3) emotional engagement, and (4) imperfection creates connection.

One approach is using a dialogue strategy in which the robot makes a remark based on previous dialogues with users. However, privacy problems may occur owing to private information of the user being mentioned. We propose a novel dialogue strategy whereby a robot mentions another robot in the form of gossiping. This dialogue strategy can improve the sense of conversation, which results in increased interest while avoiding the privacy issue. We examined our proposal by conducting a conversation experiment evaluated by subject impressions. The results demonstrated that the proposed method could help the robot to obtain higher evaluations. In particular, the perceived mind was improved in the Likert scale evaluation, whereas the robot empathy and intention to use were improved in the binary comparison evaluation. Our dialogue strategy may contribute to understanding the factors regarding the sense of conversation, thereby adding value to the field of human-robot interaction.","2020","2021-02-11 03:48:15","2021-02-11 03:48:15","","653-658","","","","","","","IEEE RO-MAN","","","","IEEE","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: IEEE; IEEE Robot & Automat Soc; Robot Soc Japan; Korean Robot Soc; Furhat Robot; EurAi; Assoc Italiana Lingusitica Computazionale; Assoc Italiana Scienze Voce; Springer; Robotics ISSN: 1944-9445 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>29th IEEE International Conference on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (IEEE RO-MAN), ELECTR NETWORK, AUG 31-SEP 04, 2020</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, inappropriate communication of self-tracking results might cause the opposite effect. Subtle self-tracking feedback is an alternative that can be provided with the aid of an artificial agent representing the self. Hence, we propose a wearable pet that reflects the user's affective states through visual and haptic feedback. By eliciting empathy and fostering helping behaviors towards it, users would indirectly help themselves. A wearable prototype was built, and three user studies performed to evaluate the appropriateness of the proposed affective representations. Visual representations using facial and body cues were clear for valence and less clear for arousal.

The researcher focuses on the means of dehumanising the communist enemy, external and internal, by equating it to a machine. The author applies Nick Haslam's dual model of dehumanization (2006), according to which dehumanization is visible in two main forms: animalistic, by associating members of the out-group with animals, and mechanistic, by associating them with a soulless machine. The materials used consist of US films from the “Long Fifties”, in which Hollywood, equating the enemy to machines, developed three plots: the robotic existence of individuals in a totalitarian society; the transformation of Americans into zombies by communists by means of Soviet science; and the body snatching of Americans by an alien mind, an allegory of a future communist occupation of the USA. The article demonstrates that dehumanization was implemented by directly labeling the representatives of the communist world as robots and by attributing to them a lack of emotions, consciousness, will, individuality, initiative, warmth, love, friendship, creative abilities, and even the ability to smile. Such an image of the enemy implied a moral exclusion, treating them as an inanimate object unworthy of empathy, including in the event of their destruction. The author points out that the use of mechanistic dehumanization was very effective. Essentialization of the differences between “us” and “them” occurred: the symbolic border between them is presented as a boundary between living and nonliving. The image of mortal danger was created: the “Red Machine” is strong and merciless, it cannot be moved to pity, and so it is permissible to destroy it. This image contributed to the legitimation of power: the political opponents of the authorities are represented as internal enemies who are anxious to turn Americans into obedient executors of someone else's will and to deprive them of humanity. At the same time, the machine also has weaknesses, and it is possible to defeat it: since it is devoid of human creativity, it is clearly inferior to the free human spirit embodied in America.","2020","2021-02-11 03:48:16","2021-02-11 03:48:16","","536-550","","2","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: PROSPEKT LENINA 51, EKATERINBURG, 620083, RUSSIA Publisher: URAL FEDERAL UNIV Type: Article","","","","","dehumanization; Cold War; image of Russia; image of the enemy; propaganda; US cinema","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Through this study, we investigated whether the emotional reactions of a group of bystander robots could motivate a human to intervene in response to robot abuse. Our results show that participants were more likely to prosocially intervene when the bystander robots expressed sadness in response to the abuse as opposed to when they ignored these events, despite participants reporting similar perception of robot mistreatment and levels of empathy for the abused robot.

In addition, it was confirmed that the pupil response is effective for enhancing affective conveyance by using the developed system in which an interactive CG character generates the pupil response based on the synchronization with the burst-pause of utterance. In this study, we developed a video communication system with a virtual pupil CG superimposed on the partner's pupil for enhancing affective conveyance. This system generates a virtual pupil response in synchronization with the talker's burst-pause of utterance.

However, cognitive skills are not sufficient for a successful life. Understanding and managing the emotions of oneself is another crucial factor in success. The current state of the art teaching methods educates the kids about programming and emotional intelligence independently. In our opinion, it is advantageous to teach kids emotional intelligence, along with the programming concepts. However, the literature lacks the studies that make students emotionally aware while teaching them programming. This research aims to prepare students to be cognitively healthy as well as emotionally intelligent with the hypothesis that a kid's emotional intelligence can be enhanced while teaching them cognitive skills. We proposed a computational model that teaches programming and emotional intelligence side by side to students. The model provides a curriculum and related tools. For evaluations, five hundred students of a public school were involved in different activities to find the effectiveness of the proposed model. These students were divided into five groups (A, B, C, D, and E), each having a mean age of 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 years, respectively. Students performed multiple adaptive scenarios of path-finding that were based on self-awareness, social-awareness, sharing, and empathy emotions. Students provide the programming instructions such as sequencing, conditional statements, and looping to a robot. The children have successfully improved in both fundamental programming constructs and emotional intelligence skills. The research also successfully reduced screen time problem by providing a screen-free student interface.","2020","2021-02-11 03:48:17","2021-02-11 03:48:17","","149616-149629","","","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA Publisher: IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC Type: Article","","","","","Computational modeling; Education; Robots; Emotional intelligence; basic programming; Programming profession; robots based learning; screen-free interface; Sequential analysis; Tools","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study examines perceived mistreatment directed towards a robot in comparison to a computer. This will provide some understanding of how people feel about robots in collaborative social settings. We conducted a two by two between-subjects study with 80 participants. Participants worked cooperatively with either a robot or a computer agent. An experiment confederate would either act aggressively or neutrally towards the agent. We hypothesized that people would not perceive aggressive speech as mistreatment when an agent was capable of emotional feelings and similar to themselves; that participants would perceive the robot as more similar in appearance and emotionally capable to themselves than a computer; and so would observe more mistreatment with a robot. The final results supported our hypotheses; the participants observed greater mistreatment for the robot, but not the computer. Also participants felt significantly more sympathetic towards the robot and believed that it was much more emotionally capable.","2019-12","2021-02-11 03:48:18","2021-02-11 03:48:18","","727-739","","5","11","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article","","","","","Perception; Human-robot interaction; Human-robot cooperation; Mistreatment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A fundamental requirement in all social interactions is the ability to engage, maintain, and demonstrate attention. Attentional behaviors include leaning forward, self-disclosure, and changes in voice pitch. Objective: This study aimed to examine the effect of robot attentional behaviors on user perceptions and behaviors in a simulated health care interaction. Methods: A parallel randomized controlled trial with a 1:1:1 allocation ration was conducted. We randomized participants to 1 of 4 experimental conditions before engaging in a scripted face-to-face interaction with a fully automated medical receptionist robot. Experimental conditions included a self-disclosure condition, voice pitch change condition, forward lean condition, and neutral condition. Participants completed paper-based postinteraction measures relating to engagement, perceived robot attention, and perceived robot empathy. We video recorded interactions and coded for participant attentional behaviors. Results: A total of 181 participants were recruited from the University of Auckland. Participants who interacted with the robot in the forward lean and self-disclosure conditions found the robot to be significantly more stimulating than those who interacted with the robot in the voice pitch or neutral conditions (P=.03). Participants in the forward lean, self-disclosure, and neutral conditions found the robot to be significantly more interesting than those in the voice pitch condition (P<.001). Participants in the forward lean and self-disclosure conditions spent significantly more time looking at the robot than participants in the neutral condition (P<.001). Significantly, more participants in the self-disclosure condition laughed during the interaction (P=.01), whereas significantly more participants in the forward lean condition leant toward the robot during the interaction (P<.001). Conclusions: The use of self-disclosure and forward lean by a health care robot can increase human engagement and attentional behaviors. Voice pitch changes did not increase attention or engagement. The small effects with regard to participant perceptions are potentially because of the limitations in self-report measures or a lack of comparison for most participants who had never interacted with a robot before. Further research could explore the use of self-disclosure and forward lean using a within-subjects design and in real health care settings.","2019-10-04","2021-02-11 03:48:18","2021-02-11 03:48:18","","","","10","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 130 QUEENS QUAY E, STE 1102, TORONTO, ON M5A 0P6, CANADA Publisher: JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC Type: Article","","","","","engagement; social interaction; robotics; health care robotics; social intelligence","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In order to successfully synchronize with others, INTRApersonal synchronization of communicative signals appears to be a necessary prerequisite. We understand INTRApersonal synchrony as an implicit factor of INTERpersonal synchrony and therefore hypothesize that atypicalities of INTRApersonal synchrony may add to INTERpersonal synchrony problems in ASD and their interaction partners.

Second, we draft a theoretical conceptualization of INTRApersonal dissynchrony in ASD based on a temporal model of human interaction. We will outline literature indicating INTRApersonal dissynchrony in ASD, therefore highlighting findings of atypical timing functions and findings from clinical and behavioral studies that indicate peculiar motion patterns and communicative signal production in ASD. Third, we hypothesize that findings from these domains suggest an assessment and investigation of temporal parameters of social behavior in individuals with ASD. We will further propose specific goals of empirical approaches on INTRApersonal dissynchrony. Finally we present implications of research on INTRApersonal timing in ASD for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, what in our opinion warrants the increase of research efforts in this domain.","2019-08-20","2021-02-11 03:48:18","2021-02-11 03:48:18","","","","","6","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND Publisher: FRONTIERS MEDIA SA Type: Article","","","","","human-human interaction; non-verbal behavior; autism spectrum disorder; INTERpersonal synchrony; INTRApersonal synchrony; timing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In contrast to industrial robots that, for example, may be used on an assembly line, social robots are designed specifically to interact with humans and/or other robots. People tend to perceive social robots as autonomous and capable of having a mind. As such, they are also more likely to be subject to social categorization by humans. As social robots become more human like, people may also feel greater empathy for them and treat robots more like (human) ingroup members. On the other hand, as they become more human like, robots also challenge our human distinctiveness, threaten our identity, and elicit suspicion about their ability to deceive us with their human-like qualities. We review relevant research to explore this apparent paradox, particularly from an intergroup relations perspective. We discuss these findings and propose three research questions that we believe social psychologists are ideally suited to address.","2019-08","2021-02-11 03:48:18","2021-02-11 03:48:18","","","","8","13","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we use a simple neuroscience-inspired procedure to beam our human subjects into one of two distinct robots and demonstrate how this can readily increase acceptability and social closeness to that robot. Participants wore a Head Mounted Display tracking their head movements and displaying the 3D visual scene taken from the eyes of a robot which was positioned in front of a mirror and piloted by the subjects' head movements. As a result, participants saw themselves as a robot. When participant' and robot's head movements were correlated, participants felt that they were incorporated into the robot with a sense of agency. Critically, the robot they embodied was judged more likeable and socially closer. Remarkably, we found that the beaming experience with correlated head movements and corresponding sensation of embodiment and social proximity, was independent of robots' humanoid's appearance. These findings not only reveal the ease of body-swapping, via visual-motor synchrony, into robots that do not share any clear human resemblance, but they may also pave a new way to make our future robotic helpers socially acceptable.","2019-07-12","2021-02-11 03:48:19","2021-02-11 03:48:19","","","","","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND Publisher: NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In light of this, how can we infer communication signs of other species so we are able to connect with the nonhuman world? We look for answers to this question by adopting a phenomenological approach that allows us to decentre from the anthropocentric perspective. We highlight animal studies, especially those that extend to them the notion of play, and the studies on interspecies playful interaction conducted in the context of animal- computer interaction.

Many applications require that robots adapt their behavior to different users and remember each user's preferences to engage them in the interaction. To this end, we propose a decision making system for social robots that drives their actions taking into account the user and the robot's state. This system is based on bio-inspired concepts, such as motivations, drives and wellbeing, that facilitate the rise of natural behaviors to ease the acceptance of the robot by the users. The system has been designed to promote the human-robot interaction by using drives and motivations related with social aspects, such as the users' satisfaction or the need of social interaction. Furthermore, the changes of state produced by the users' exogenous actions have been modeled as transitional states that are considered when the next robot's action has to be selected. Our system has been evaluated considering two different user profiles. In the proposed system, user's preferences are considered and alter the homeostatic process that controls the decision making system. As a result, using reinforcement learning algorithms and considering the robot's wellbeing as the reward function, the social robot Mini has learned from scratch two different policies of action, one for each user, that fit the users' preferences. The robot learned behaviors that maximize its wellbeing as well as keep the users engaged in the interactions. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In the present study, we combined functional neuroimaging with a robot socializing intervention to probe the flexibility of empathy, a core component of social relationships, towards robots. Twenty-six individuals underwent identical fMRI sessions before and after being issued a social robot to take home and interact with over the course of a week. While undergoing fMRI, participants observed videos of a human actor or a robot experiencing pain or pleasure in response to electrical stimulation. Repetition suppression of activity in the pain network, a collection of brain regions associated with empathy and emotional responding, was measured to test whether socializing with a social robot leads to greater overlap in neural mechanisms when observing human and robotic agents experiencing pain or pleasure. In contrast to our hypothesis, functional region-of-interest analyses revealed no change in neural overlap for agents after the socializing intervention. Similarly, no increase in activation when observing a robot experiencing pain emerged post-socializing. Whole-brain analysis showed that, before the socializing intervention, superior parietal and early visual regions are sensitive to novel agents, while after socializing, medial temporal regions show agent sensitivity. A region of the inferior parietal lobule was sensitive to novel emotions, but only during the pre-socializing scan session. Together, these findings suggest that a short socialization intervention with a social robot does not lead to discernible differences in empathy towards the robot, as measured by behavioural or brain responses. We discuss the extent to which long-term socialization with robots might shape social cognitive processes and ultimately our relationships with these machines.

We address two research questions: (1) Can an autonomous robot designed with empathic competencies foster collaborative learning in a group context? (2) Can an empathic robot sustain positive educational outcomes in long-term collaborative learning interactions with groups of students? To answer these questions, we developed an autonomous robot with empathic competencies that is able to interact with a group of students in a learning activity about sustainable development. Two studies were conducted. The first study compares learning outcomes in children across three conditions: learning with an empathic robot; learning with a robot without empathic capabilities; and learning without a robot. The results show that the autonomous robot with empathy fosters meaningful discussions about sustainability, which is a learning outcome in sustainability education. The second study features groups of students who interact with the robot in a school classroom for 2 months. The long-term educational interaction did not seem to provide significant learning gains, although there was a change in game-actions to achieve more sustainability during game-play. This result reflects the need to perform more long-term research in the field of educational robots for group learning.","2019-03","2021-02-11 03:48:20","2021-02-11 03:48:20","","","","1","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 2 PENN PLAZA, STE 701, NEW YORK, NY 10121-0701 USA Publisher: ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY Type: Article","","","","","education; empathy; human-robot interaction; collaborative learning; group learning; learning gains; Social robotics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

If a robot can identify emotions and intentions of a human interacting with it, interactions with humans can potentially become more natural and effective. However, mechanisms of perception and empathy used by humans to achieve this understanding may not be suitable or adequate for use within robots. Electroencephalography (EEG) can be used for recording signals revealing emotions and motivations from a human brain. This study aimed to evaluate different machine learning techniques to classify EEG data associated with specific affective/emotional states. For experimental purposes, we used visual (IAPS) and physical (Tower of Hanoi) tasks to record human emotional states in the form of EEG data. The obtained EEG data processed, formatted and evaluated using various machine learning techniques to find out which method can most accurately classify EEG data according to associated affective/emotional states. The experiment confirms the choice of a method for improving the accuracy of results. According to the results, Support Vector Machine was the first, and Regression Tree was the second best method for classifying EEG data associated with specific affective/emotional states with accuracies up to 70.00% and 60.00%, respectively.

In order to create empathy between human-robot, a robot must be able to estimate the emotion of human and reflect the same emotion on its expression. In general, emotion can be estimated based on observable expressions such as facial expression, or unobservable expressions such as biological signals. Although there are many methods for measuring emotion from both facial expression and biological signals, few studies have been done on the comparison of estimated emotion. In this paper, we investigate whether emotion estimated from facial expression or biological signals could lead to empathy toward a robot.

A large number of current approaches that address this problem focus on classifying emotion expressions by grouping them into known categories. Such strategies neglect, among other aspects, the impact of the affective responses from an individual on their interaction partner thus ignoring how people empathize towards each other. This is also reflected in the datasets used to train models for affective processing tasks. Most of the recent datasets, in particular, the ones which capture natural interactions (”in-the-wild” datasets), are designed, collected, and annotated based on the recognition of displayed affective reactions, ignoring how these displayed or expressed emotions are perceived. In this paper, we propose a novel dataset composed of dyadic interactions designed, collected and annotated with a focus on measuring the affective impact that eight different stories have on the listener. Each video of the dataset contains around 5 minutes of interaction where a speaker tells a story to a listener. After each interaction, the listener annotated, using a valence scale, how the story impacted their affective state, reflecting how they empathized with the speaker as well as the story. We also propose different evaluation protocols and a baseline that encourages participation in the advancement of the field of artificial empathy and emotion contagion.","2019","2021-02-11 03:48:21","2021-02-11 03:48:21","","","","","","","","","International Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction","","","","IEEE","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","English","","","","","","","ISSN: 2156-8103 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>8th International Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction (ACII), Cambridge, ENGLAND, SEP 03-06, 2019</p>","","","","Empathy; Affective Behaviour; Dyadic Interactions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper presents our contribution to the generalised track of the One-Minute Gradual ( OMG) Empathy Prediction Challenge by describing our approach to predict a listener's valence during semi-scripted actor-listener interactions. We extract visual and acoustic features from the interactions and feed them into a bidirectional long short-term memory network to capture the time-dependencies of the valence-based empathy during the interactions. Generalised and personalised unimodal and multimodal valence-based empathy models are then trained to assess the impact of each modality on the system performance. Furthermore, we analyse if intra-subject dependencies on empathy perception affect the system performance. We assess the models by computing the concordance correlation coefficient ( CCC) between the predicted and self-annotated valence scores. The results support the suitability of employing multimodal data to recognise participants' valence-based empathy during the interactions, and highlight the subject-dependency of empathy. In particular, we obtained our best result with a personalised multimodal model, which achieved a CCC of 0.11 on the test set.","2019","2021-02-11 03:48:21","2021-02-11 03:48:21","","721-725","","","","","","","IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition and Workshops","","","","IEEE","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: IEEE; Univ Lille; Inst Mines Telecom; Univ Lille, Inst Mines Telecom, Ecole Mines Telecom, IMT Lille Douai; INRIA; 3DMD; Google; I Site Univ Lille Nord Europe; Centre Rech Informatique Signal Automatique Lille; IEEE Comp Soc; IEEE Biometr Council ISSN: 2326-5396 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>14th IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition (FG), Lille, FRANCE, MAY 14-18, 2019</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For a human-machine team in a military context to work at maximum efficiency, an ideal level of empathy towards an automated teammate must be obtained. The goal of this study is to determine the effect stress can have on an individual's empathetic reaction toward a Pepper robot. Twenty-eight participants interacted with a Pepper robot either under stress or not. Empathy toward the robot was measured through subjective assessments as well as by participant decisions to continue interacting with Pepper even though doing so would harm the robot. Although not conclusive, the results suggest an interaction between participant gender and stress on empathy toward the Pepper robot. Women showed more empathy toward Pepper under higher levels of stress than lower levels of stress. However, the opposite was true for men.

Although much work in human-robot interaction describes the meaningful relationships that humans forge with their robots in one-on-one encounters, when robots venture into places where humans cannot go - in search and rescue operations, ocean voyages, or even into space - they do so as part of a large human team. Decisions about what the robot should do and where it should go are therefore the result of large group interactions instead of individual human cognition: the realm of organizational sociology. This talk draws on over a decade of ethnography with NASA's robotic spacecraft missions, specifically focusing on the Mars Exploration Rover mission. Going behind the scenes of the mission, I show the meaning-making, emotional connections, and embodied synergy that scientists develop as they work with their robots millions of miles away on a daily basis. This begins by learning to see through the robots' “eyes” on another planet, yet the peculiar social arrangement of mission work produces a deeper connection to the robot explorers too: one that is no doubt responsible for the extraordinary success and unexpected longevity of the mission team. Studying robotic spacecraft teams demonstrates how humans build a particular and peculiar empathy with their robotic colleagues that goes beyond anthropomorphism. Instead, this case points to the many and unusual ways in which organizations participate in our interactions with, understanding of, and ultimately care for the robots we work with in everyday life.","2019","2021-02-11 03:48:22","2021-02-11 03:48:22","","152","","","","","","","ACM IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction","","","","IEEE","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: Assoc Comp Machinery; IEEE; IEEE Robot & Automat Soc; ACM SIGCHI; ACM SIGAI; AAAI; Korea Tourism Org; Daegu Convent & Visitors Bur; ColorfulDaegu ISSN: 2167-2121 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>14th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), Daegu, SOUTH KOREA, MAR 11-14, 2019</p>","","","","Teamwork; Human-Robot Interaction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper we present one such robot design: we developed Sam, a robot that learns minimal information about a person's background, and adapts to this background. Our in-the-wild study found that people helped Sam for significantly longer when it adapted to match their background. While initially we saw this as a success, in re-considering our study we started seeing a different angle. Our robot effectively deceived people ( changed its story and text), based on some knowledge of their background, to get more work from them. There was little direct benefit to the person from this adaptation, yet the robot stood to gain free labor. We would like to pose the question to the community: is this simply good robot design, or, is our robot being manipulative? Where does the ethical line lay between a robot leveraging social techniques to improve interaction, and the more negative framing of a robot or algorithm taking advantage of people? How can we decide what is good here, and what is less desirable?","2019","2021-02-11 03:48:22","2021-02-11 03:48:22","","382-391","","","","","","","ACM IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction","","","","IEEE","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: Assoc Comp Machinery; IEEE; IEEE Robot & Automat Soc; ACM SIGCHI; ACM SIGAI; AAAI; Korea Tourism Org; Daegu Convent & Visitors Bur; ColorfulDaegu ISSN: 2167-2121 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>14th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), Daegu, SOUTH KOREA, MAR 11-14, 2019</p>","","","","culture; social robots; in the wild; persuasive robots","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The game scenario describes a treasure hunt around Europe and students swap between finger-based and robotics-based interactive surfaces in two pairs. We evaluated our intervention with pre-service teachers in six groups of three or four who played with the environment for approximately 45 minutes each. Data collection was performed through pre- and post-knowledge test, attitude questionnaire and a semi-formal group interview. The answers showed that the mixed reality environment improved motivation, engagement and enhanced their orientation around Europe's geophysical features. The robotics aspect consolidated further their computational thinking skills while being highly exciting. The proposed approach was closer to the preservice teacher's expectations and interactive experiences, exploited embodied learning opportunities and gamified the learning process.","2019","2021-02-11 03:48:22","2021-02-11 03:48:22","","78-94","","2","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: DIAGONALE 10, D-34127 KASSEL, GERMANY Publisher: KASSEL UNIV PRESS GMBH Type: Article","","","","","educational robotics; geography learning; history learning; Mixed reality; tangible interfaces","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Currently, we investigated if the presence of a facial wound enhanced the perception of mental capacities (experience and agency) in response to images of robotic and human-like avatars, compared with unharmed avatars. The results revealed that harmed versions of both robotic and human-like avatars were imbued with mind to a higher degree, irrespective of the baseline level of mind attributed to their unharmed counterparts. Perceptions of capacity for pain mediated attributions of experience, while both pain and empathy mediated attributions of abilities linked to agency.

Nine studies suggest that that the answer is `no'-in part because machines lack a complete mind. Studies 1-6 find that people are averse to machines making morally-relevant driving, legal, medical, and military decisions, and that this aversion is mediated by the perception that machines can neither fully think nor feel. Studies 5-6 find that this aversion exists even when moral decisions have positive outcomes. Studies 7-9 briefly investigate three potential routes to increasing the acceptability of machine moral decision-making: limiting the machine to an advisory role (Study 7), increasing machines' perceived experience (Study 8), and increasing machines' perceived expertise (Study 9). Although some of these routes show promise, the aversion to machine moral decision-making is difficult to eliminate. This aversion may prove challenging for the integration of autonomous technology in moral domains including medicine, the law, the military, and self-driving vehicles.","2018-12","2021-02-11 03:48:22","2021-02-11 03:48:22","","21-34","","","181","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS Publisher: ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV Type: Article","","","","","Robots; Morality; Mind perception; Autonomous machines; Moral agency; Skynet","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Relatedly, a growing literature documents that contexts of threat can exacerbate coalitional biases in social perceptions. Integrating these research programs, the present studies test whether cues of violent intergroup conflict modulate perceptions of the intelligence, emotional experience, or overall personhood of robots. In Studies 1 and 2, participants evaluated a large, bipedal all-terrain robot; in Study 3, participants evaluated a small, social robot with humanlike facial and vocal characteristics. Across all studies, cues of violent conflict caused significant decreases in perceived robotic personhood, and these shifts were mediated by parallel reductions in emotional connection with the robot (with no significant effects of threat on attributions of intelligence/skill). In addition, in Study 2, participants in the conflict condition estimated the large bipedal robot to be less effective in military combat, and this difference was mediated by the reduction in perceived robotic personhood. These results are discussed as they motivate future investigation into the links among threat, coalitional bias and human-robot interaction.","2018-11","2021-02-11 03:48:22","2021-02-11 03:48:22","","","","4","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 2 PENN PLAZA, STE 701, NEW YORK, NY 10121-0701 USA Publisher: ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY Type: Article","","","","","Theory of Mind; empathy; human-robot interaction; group prejudice; Threat detection","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

ACM Press, New York, 2011. 10.1145/1957656.1957786). However, some robots lack the possibility to produce HNB. Using robot-specific nonverbal behavior (RNB) such as different eye colors to convey emotional meaning might be a fruitful mechanism to enhance HRI experiences, but it is unclear whether RNB is as effective as HNB. We present a review on affective nonverbal behaviors in robots and an experimental study. We experimentally tested the influence of HNB and RNB (colored LEDs) on users' perception of the robot (e.g. likeability, animacy), their emotional experience, and self-disclosure. In a between-subjects design, users interacted with either (a) a robot displaying no nonverbal behavior, (b) a robot displaying affective RNB, (c) a robot displaying affective HNB or (d) a robot displaying affective HNB and RNB. Results show that HNB, but not RNB, has a significant effect on the perceived animacy of the robot, participants' emotional state, and self-disclosure. However, RNB still slightly influenced participants' perception, emotion, and behavior: Planned contrasts revealed having any type of nonverbal behavior significantly increased perceived animacy, positive affect, and self-disclosure. Moreover, observed linear trends indicate that the effects increased with the addition of nonverbal behaviors (control< RNB< HNB). In combination, our results suggest that HNB is more effective in transporting the robot's communicative message than RNB.","2018-11","2021-02-11 03:48:22","2021-02-11 03:48:22","","569-582","","5","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article","","","","","Human-robot interaction; Affective nonverbal behavior; Emotional state; Experimental study; Humanoid robot; Self-disclosure","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Revealing potential similarities in communicative exchanges in both groups when in contact with a human or a toy robot, the results might signify that emotional empathy requires the implication of an automatic identification. In this sense, emotional empathy might be considered a broad idiosyncrasy, a kind of synchronisation, offering the mind a peculiar form of communication.

It is concluded that attention to relationality and to verbal and non-verbal languages of suffering is key to understand the phenomenon under investigation, and that in robot ethics we need less certainty and more caution and patience when it comes to thinking about moral standing.","2018-06","2021-02-11 03:48:23","2021-02-11 03:48:23","","141-158","","1","20","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: DE GRUYTER POLAND SP Z O O, BOGUMILA ZUGA 32A STR, 01-811 WARSAW, POLAND Publisher: SCIENDO Type: Article","","","","","robots; empathy; language; phenomenology; art; hermeneutics; moral standing; relations; Wittgenstein","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As robots are starting to move from industry halls to our private homes, emotions have become a vital theme for the field of human-robot interaction. Since Darwin, research suggests facial expressions are associated with emotions. Facial expressions could provide an ideal tool for a natural, social human-robot interaction. Despite a growing body of research on the implementation of emotions in robots (mostly based on facial expressions), systematic research on users' emotions and facial expressions towards robots remains largely neglected (cf. Arkin and Moshkina in Calvo R, D'Mello S, Gratch J, Kappas A (eds) The Oxford handbook of affective computing. Oxford University Press, New York, pp 483-493, 2015 on challenges in effective testing in affective human-robot interaction). We experimentally investigated the multilevel phenomenon of emotions by using a multi-method approach. Since self-reports of emotions are prone to biases such as social desirability, we supplemented it by an objective behavioral measurement. By using the Facial Action Coding System we analyzed the facial expressions of 62 participants who watched the entertainment robot dinosaur Pleo either in a friendly interaction or being tortured. Participants differed in the type and frequency of Action Units displayed as well as in their self-reported feelings depending on the type of treatment they had watched (friendly or torture). In line with a previous study by Rosenthal-von der Putten et al. (Int J Soc Robot 5(1):17-34, 2013. https://doi.org/10.1007/s12369-012-0173-8), participants reported feeling more positive after the friendly video and more negative after the torture video. In the torture condition, participants furthermore showed a wide range of different Action Units primarily associated with negative emotions. For example, the Action Unit 4 (”Brow Lowerer”) that is common in negative emotions such as anger and sadness was displayed more frequently in the torture condition than in the friendly condition. The Action Unit 12 (”Lip Corner Puller”) however, an Action Unit commonly associated with joy, was present in both conditions and thus not necessarily predictive of positive emotions. The findings indicate the importance for a thorough investigation of the variables of emotional facial expressions. In investigating the Action Units participants display due to an emotional situation, we aim to provide information on spontaneous facial expressions towards a robot that could also serve as guidance for automatic approaches.","2018-04","2021-02-11 03:48:23","2021-02-11 03:48:23","","199-209","","2, SI","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article","","","","","Emotion; Empathy; Human-robot interaction; Emotional response; Facial Action Coding System; Facial expression","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A human-robot dialog scenario is chosen using NAO pretending to work for a supermarket and involving humans providing object names to the robot for training purposes. In a user study, two conditions are implemented with or without explicit emotional adaptation of NAO to the human user in a between-subjects design. Evaluations of user experience and acceptance are conducted based on evaluated measures of human-robot interaction (HRI). The results of the user study reveal a significant increase of helpfulness (number of named objects), anthropomorphism, and empathy in the explicit emotional adaptation condition even without social cues of facial Action Units, but only in case of prior robot contact of the test persons. Otherwise, an opposite effect is found. These findings suggest, that reduction of these social cues can be overcome by robot experience prior to the interaction task, e.g. realizable by an additional bonding phase, confirming the importance of such from previous work. Additionally, an interaction with academic background of the participants is found.","2018","2021-02-11 03:48:23","2021-02-11 03:48:23","","275-281","","","","","","","IEEE RO-MAN","","","","IEEE","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: IEEE; IEEE Robot & Automat Soc; Robot Soc Japan; Korea Robot Soc; Nanjing Forestry Univ ISSN: 1944-9445 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>27th IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (IEEE RO-MAN), Nanjing, PEOPLES R CHINA, AUG 27-31, 2018</p>","","","","","Cabibihan, JJ and Mastrogiovanni, F and Pandey, AK and Rossi, S and Staffa, M","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, a human perception experiment evaluates whether human subjects perceive empathy in robot speech. For this experiment, empathy is expressed only by adding appropriate emotions to the words in speech. Also, humans' preferences for a robot interacting with empathetic speech versus a standard robotic voice are also assessed. The results show that humans are able to perceive empathy and emotions in robot speech, and prefer it over the standard robotic voice.

Despite significant progress towards the development of empathic social agents, current social robots have yet to reach the full emotional and social capabilities. This paper presents our recent effort on incorporating an automated Facial Expression Recognition (FER) system based on deep neural networks into the spoken dialog of a social robot (Ryan) to extend and enrich its capabilities beyond spoken dialog and integrate the user's affect state into the robot's responses. In order to evaluate whether this incorporation can improve social capabilities of Ryan, we conducted a series of Human-Robot-Interaction (HRI) experiments. In these experiments the subjects watched some videos and Ryan engaged them in a conversation driven by user's facial expressions perceived by the robot. We measured the accuracy of the automated FER system on the robot when interacting with different human subjects as well as three social/interactive aspects, namely task engagement, empathy, and likability of the robot. The results of our HRI study indicate that the subjects rated empathy and likability of the affect-aware Ryan significantly higher than non-empathic (the control condition) Ryan. Interestingly, we found that the accuracy of the FER system is not a limiting factor, as subjects rated the affect-aware agent equipped with a low accuracy FER system as empathic and likable as when facial expression was recognized by a human observer.","2018","2021-02-11 03:48:23","2021-02-11 03:48:23","","783-789","","","","","","","IEEE RO-MAN","","","","IEEE","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: IEEE; IEEE Robot & Automat Soc; Robot Soc Japan; Korea Robot Soc; Nanjing Forestry Univ ISSN: 1944-9445 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>27th IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (IEEE RO-MAN), Nanjing, PEOPLES R CHINA, AUG 27-31, 2018</p>","","","","","Cabibihan, JJ and Mastrogiovanni, F and Pandey, AK and Rossi, S and Staffa, M","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This perspective may need to be reconsidered, however, if some team members are autonomous robots since establishing bonds with fundamentally inanimate and expendable objects may prove counterproductive. Previous work has measured empathic responses towards robots as singular events at the conclusion of experimental sessions. As relationships extend over long periods of time, sustained empathic behavior towards robots would be of interest. In order to measure user actions that may vary over time and are affected by empathy towards a robot teammate, we created the TEAMMATE simulation system. Our findings suggest that inducing empathy through a back story narrative can significantly change participant decisions in actions that may have consequences for a robot companion over time. The results of our study can have strong implications for the overall performance of human machine teams.","2018","2021-02-11 03:48:23","2021-02-11 03:48:23","","","","","","","","","","","","","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: Amer Psychol Assoc Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>Technology, Mind, and Society Conference (TechMindSociety), Washington, DC, APR 05-07, 2018</p>","","","","Robotics; Empathy; Anthropomorphism; Human Machine Team; User Study","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We designed a between-subjects study where 48 participants took part in a memorization task and observed a confederate mistreating a robot both verbally and physically. The robot was either empathetic towards the participant's performance in the task or indifferent. When the robot was mistreated, it ignored the abuse, shut down in response to it, or reacted emotionally. We found that the majority of the participants intervened to help the robot after it was abused. Interventions happened for a wide range of reasons. Interestingly, the empathetic robot increased the proportion of participants that self-reported intervening in comparison to the indifferent robot, but more participants moved the robot as a response to abuse in the latter case. The participants also perceived the robot being verbally mistreated more and reported higher levels of personal distress when the robot briefly shut down after abuse in comparison to when it reacted emotionally or did not react at all.","2018","2021-02-11 03:48:24","2021-02-11 03:48:24","","169-177","","","","","","","ACM IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction","","","","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: Assoc Comp Machinery; IEEE; ACM SIGCHI; ACM SIGAI; IEEE Robot & Automat Soc; Kinova; Disney Res; LuxAI; Toyota Res Inst; Furhat Robot; Honda Res Inst; Google; Beam; Robotis; Savioke; Yujin Robot; Misty Robot; Hebi Robot; Haption; Otto Motors; AAAI ISSN: 2167-2121 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>13th Annual ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), Chicago, IL, MAR 05-08, 2018</p>","","","","robots; empathy; Human-robot interaction; abuse; bullying; peer intervention","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Furthermore, the growing interest in creating robots that are capable of collaborating with other humans in team settings provides an opportunity to explore another side of human emotion, namely, group-based emotions. This paper contributes with the first model on group-based emotions in social robotic partners. We defined a model of group-based emotions for social robots that allowed us to create two distinct robotic characters that express either individual or group-based emotions. This paper also contributes with a user study where two autonomous robots embedded the previous characters, and formed two human-robot teams to play a competitive game. Our results showed that participants perceived the robot that expresses group-based emotions as more likeable and attributed higher levels of group identification and group trust towards their teams, when compared to the robotic partner that expresses individual-based emotions.","2018","2021-02-11 03:48:24","2021-02-11 03:48:24","","261-269","","","","","","","ACM IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction","","","","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: Assoc Comp Machinery; IEEE; ACM SIGCHI; ACM SIGAI; IEEE Robot & Automat Soc; Kinova; Disney Res; LuxAI; Toyota Res Inst; Furhat Robot; Honda Res Inst; Google; Beam; Robotis; Savioke; Yujin Robot; Misty Robot; Hebi Robot; Haption; Otto Motors; AAAI ISSN: 2167-2121 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>13th Annual ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), Chicago, IL, MAR 05-08, 2018</p>","","","","emotion; trust; group effects; Human-robot teamwork; identification; inter-group interactions; self-categorisation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, we proposed a counseling agent (CA) called CRECA (context respectful counseling agent), which listens to clients and promotes their reflection context respectfully namely in a context preserving way. This agent is now enhanced using a body language called “unazuki” in Japanese, a kind of nodding to greatly promote dialogue, often accompanying “un-un” (meaning “exactly”) of Japanese onomatopoeia. This body language significantly helps represent empathy or entire approval. Our agent is enhanced with such dialog promotion nodding robot to continue the conversation naturally or context respectfully towards clients' further reflection. To realize it, the robot nods twice at each end of dialog sentence input by clients. Here, we introduce a robot that behaves human-like by an appropriate nodding behavior. The motivation for such a more human-like robot was the extension of application fields from IT workers' counselling to people, who suffer from more social problems such as financial debt, or anxiety of victory or defeat. For such applications, it is important that the agent behaves as much as possible human-like. Here, we present an enhanced experimental evaluation. The quantitative evaluation is based on the utterance amounts of a test group of individuals. These amount with and without the nodding feature are compared. Additionally, the robots with and without nodding are compared according several subjective feelings by the evaluation subjects.","2018","2021-02-11 03:48:24","2021-02-11 03:48:24","","1716-1722","","","","","","","IEEE International Conference on Systems Man and Cybernetics Conference Proceedings","","","","IEEE","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: IEEE; Sci Council Japan ISSN: 1062-922X Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC), IEEE Syst Man &amp; Cybernet Soc, Miyazaki, JAPAN, OCT 07-10, 2018</p>","","","","Robot; Counseling; Dialog Promotion; Nodding; unazuki","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study proposes a computational model of emotion capable of clustering the perceived facial expression, and using cognitive reappraisal to switch its internal state so as to give a human-like reaction over the time. That is, the agent learns the person's facial expression by using Self Organizing Map, and gives it a meaning by mapping the perceived expression into its internal state diagram.

Un-fortunately, many people cannot live with animals because of allergies, infection risk, or risk of damage to rental housing. To address these problems, some research groups have investigated robot-based psychotherapy. However, the important healing elements for therapy robots were not identified. Therefore, we conducted an Internet survey to determine the design elements of such a robot that might engender a healing mood and the functions that should be implemented. We assumed that a healing mood could be induced based on the interactive functions and appearance. To verify this hypothesis, we developed and evaluated a new interactive therapy robot. Next, we conducted interviews with individuals who interacted with a prototype therapy robot. The interviews revealed that the appearance of the robot was critical to engendering feelings of healing, comfort, and empathy. In addition, the size, softness, and comfort of the interactive therapy robot contributed to people feeling affection towards it. We also confirmed the importance of the robot appearing to listen to those who interacted with it. Our results should be useful for designing companion robots for therapy purposes.","2018","2021-02-11 03:48:25","2021-02-11 03:48:25","","66-83","","","10714","","","","Lecture Notes in Computer Science","","","","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: Multimodal Technologies & Interact Journal ISSN: 0302-9743 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>14th International Conference on Advances in Computer Entertainment Technology (ACE), London, ENGLAND, DEC 14-16, 2017</p>","","","","Healing elements Therapeutic robots designed to communicate with humans; Therapeutic effect","Cheok, AD and Inami, M and Romao, T","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this situation, robots will require sophisticated capabilities, such as the ability to recognize human pain in advance and generate counter-responses as follow up emphatic action. Hence, it is important for robots to acquire an appropriate pain concept that allows them to develop these capabilities. This paper conceptualizes empathy generation through the realization of synthetic pain classes integrated into a robot's self-awareness framework, and the implementation of fault detection on the robot body serves as a primary source of pain activation. Projection of human shoulder motion into the robot arm motion acts as a fusion process, which is used as a medium to gather information for analyses then to generate corresponding synthetic pain and emphatic responses. An experiment is designed to mirror a human peer's shoulder motion into an observer robot. The results demonstrate that the fusion takes place accurately whenever unified internal states are achieved, allowing accurate classification of synthetic pain categories and generation of empathy responses in a timely fashion. Future works will consider a pain activation mechanism development.","2018","2021-02-11 03:48:25","2021-02-11 03:48:25","","56-73","","1","5","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: PO BOX 2604, SPRINGFIELD, MO 65801-2604 USA Publisher: AMER INST MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES-AIMS Type: Article","","","","","assistive robots; cognitive; empathic reaction; joint position; shoulder motion; synthetic pain","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The departing assumption is that robotisation of warfare transforms military operations into automated industrial processes with the aim of removing empathy as a redundant `cost'. The development of autonomous weapons systems raises a number of sharp ethical controversies related to the projected moral insensitivity of robots regarding the treatment of enemies and civilian population. The futurist vision of war as a foreign policy instrument entirely `purified' of the risk of morally wrong actions is in opposition with the negative effects of the use of drones. The author concludes that the use of lethal robots in combat would eventually remove enemy soldiers and civilians from the realm of ethical reasoning and deprive them of human dignity. Decision to kill in military operations ought to be based on human conscience as the only proper framework of making decisions by reasoning whether an action is right or wrong.","2018","2021-02-11 03:48:25","2021-02-11 03:48:25","","49-64","","1","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: KRALJICE NATALIJE 45, BELGRADE, 11000, SERBIA Publisher: UNIV BELGRADE, INST PHILOSOPHY & SOCIAL THEORY Type: Article","","","","","autonomous weapons systems; depersonalisation; drones; ethics of war; international relations; lethal robots; military interventions; warfare","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This principle has been shown to be effective in games between humans and between humans and computer agents. We compared the social and cognitive engagement of children when playing checkers game combined with a social strategy against a robot or against a computer. We found that by combining the social and game strategy the children (average age of 8.3 years) had more empathy and social engagement with the robot since the children did not want to necessarily win against it. This finding is promising for using social strategies for the creation of long-term relations between robots and children and making educational tasks more engaging. An additional outcome of the study was the significant difference in the perception of the children about the difficulty of the game - the game with the robot was seen as more challenging and the robot - as a smarter opponent. This finding might be due to the higher perceived or expected intelligence from the robot, or because of the higher complexity of seeing patterns in three-dimensional world.","2018","2021-02-11 03:48:25","2021-02-11 03:48:25","","81-98","","1, SI","30","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND Publisher: TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD Type: Article","","","","","combining social and game strategy; Economic game strategies for robots; engagement robot/computer; long-term relations with robots","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In order to provide a natural interaction experience, these social robots need to recognise the emotions expressed by the users across various modalities of communication and use them to estimate an internal affective model of the interaction. These internal emotions act as motivation for learning to respond to the user in different situations, using the physical capabilities of the robot. This paper proposes a deep hybrid neural model for multi-modal affect recognition, analysis and behaviour modelling in social robots. The model uses growing self-organising network models to encode intrinsic affective states for the robot. These intrinsic states are used to train a reinforcement learning model to learn facial expression representations on the Neuro-Inspired Companion (NICO) robot, enabling the robot to express empathy towards the users.","2018","2021-02-11 03:48:25","2021-02-11 03:48:25","","","","","","","","","IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","","","","IEEE","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","English","","","","","","","ISSN: 2161-4393 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN), Rio de Janeiro, BRAZIL, JUL 08-13, 2018</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As people interact more often with voice and gesture controlled machines, they expect the machines to recognize different emotions, and understand other high level communication features such as humor, sarcasm and intention. In order to make such communication possible, the machines need an empathy module in them, which is a software system that can extract emotions from human speech and behavior and can decide the correct response of the robot. Although research on empathetic robots is still in the primary stage, current methods involve using signal processing techniques, sentiment analysis and machine learning algorithms to make robots that can `understand' human emotion. Other aspects of human-robot interaction include facial expression and gesture recognition, as well as robot movement to convey emotion and intent. We propose Zara the Supergirl as a prototype system of empathetic robots. It is a software-based virtual android, with an animated cartoon character to present itself on the screen. She will get `smarter' and more empathetic, by having machine learning algorithms, and gathering more data and learning from it. In this paper, we present our work so far in the areas of deep learning of emotion and sentiment recognition, as well as humor recognition. We hope to explore the future direction of android development and how it can help improve people's lives.","2018","2021-02-11 03:48:25","2021-02-11 03:48:25","","173-193","","","9624","","","","Lecture Notes in Computer Science","","","","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","English","","","","","","","ISSN: 0302-9743 Issue: II Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>17th International Conference on Intelligent Text Processing and Computational Linguistics (CICLing), Mevlana Univ, Konya, TURKEY, APR 03-09, 2016</p>","","","","","Gelbukh, A","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of this study is to compare two models describing social-emotional behavior, one of which is based on a traditional machine learning algorithm, and the other on a cognitive architecture supporting social emotionality. It is hypothesized that the second model will be more efficient in eliciting user's empathy to a virtual cobot based on this model. Here the object of study is a virtual pet: a penguin. Two models controlling the pet were compared: a reinforcement learning model (a Q-learning algorithm) and the emotional cognitive architecture eBICA (Samsonovich, 2013). The second approach was based on a semantic map of pet's emotional states, that was constructed based on the human ranking. It is found that the eBICA model scores higher in participant's empathy compared to the model based on reinforcement learning. This article compares strengths and weaknesses of both methods. In conclusion, the findings indicate advantages of the approach based on eBICA compared to more traditional techniques. Results will have broad implications for building intelligent social agents.

This study performs an experiment in WOZ environment in which different subjects (n=17) interacting with the same robot while they believe that the robot is a different robot, up to three versions.

The behavior that would induce human-like feelings after long exposures is difficult to determine, and it often depends on the cultural background of the observers. Therefore, in this study, we generate an acting performance system for the android, in which an android and a human interact in a stage play in the real world. We adopt the theatrical theory called Contemporary Colloquial Theatre Theory to give the android natural behaviors so that audiences can comfortably observe it even after long-minute exposure. A stage play is created and shown in various locations, and the audiences are requested to report their impressions of the stage and their cultural and psychological backgrounds in a self-evaluating questionnaire. Overall analysis indicates that the audience had positive feelings, in terms of attractiveness, towards the android on the stage even after 20 min of exposure. The singularly high acceptance of the android by Japanese audiences seems to be correlated with a high animism tendency, rather than to empathy. We also discuss how the stage play approach is limited and could be extended to contribute to realization of human-robot interaction in the real world.","2017-12","2021-02-11 03:48:26","2021-02-11 03:48:26","","","","4","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND Publisher: MDPI AG Type: Article","","","","","social robots; android theatre; contemporary colloquial theatre theory; robot theatre","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet an even more controversial practice could be on the horizon, which is allowing a robot to “nudge” a user's behavior for the good of society. In this article, we examine the feasibility of creating companion robots that would seek to nurture a user's empathy toward other human beings. As more and more computing devices subtly and overtly influence human behavior, it is important to draw attention to whether it would be ethically appropriate for roboticists to pursue this type of design pathway. Our primary focus is on whether a companion robot could encourage humans to perform charitable acts; this design possibility illustrates the range of socially just actions that a robot could potentially elicit from a user and what the associated ethical concerns may be.","2017-11","2021-02-11 03:48:26","2021-02-11 03:48:26","","499-507","","4","32","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article","","","","","Empathy; Charity; Companion robots; Design ethics; Nudges; Robot ethics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Mind perception also modulates the attitudes we have toward others, and determines the degree of empathy, prosociality, and morality invested in social interactions. Seeing mind in others is not exclusive to human agents, but mind can also be ascribed to non-human agents like robots, as long as their appearance and/or behavior allows them to be perceived as intentional beings. Previous studies have shown that human appearance and reliable behavior induce mind perception to robot agents, and positively affect attitudes and performance in human-robot interaction. What has not been investigated so far is whether different triggers of mind perception have an independent or interactive effect on attitudes and performance in human-robot interaction. We examine this question by manipulating agent appearance (human vs. robot) and behavior (reliable vs. random) within the same paradigm and examine how congruent (human/reliable vs. robot/random) versus incongruent (human/random vs. robot/reliable) combinations of these triggers affect performance (i.e., gaze following) and attitudes (i.e., agent ratings) in human-robot interaction. The results show that both appearance and behavior affect human-robot interaction but that the two triggers seem to operate in isolation, with appearance more strongly impacting attitudes, and behavior more strongly affecting performance. The implications of these findings for human-robot interaction are discussed.","2017-08-23","2021-02-11 03:48:26","2021-02-11 03:48:26","","","","","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND Publisher: FRONTIERS MEDIA SA Type: Article","","","","","intentionality; social cognition; human-robot interaction; social robotics; mind perception","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We conducted a three-week repeated exposure experiment where 40 children interacted with socially assistive robotic characters that acted out interactive stories around words that contribute to expanding children's emotional vocabulary. Our results showed that although participants who interacted alone with the robots recalled the stories better than participants in the group condition, no significant differences were found in children's emotional interpretation of the narratives. With regard to individual differences, we found that a single child setting appeared more appropriate to first graders than a group setting, empathy level is an important predictor for emotional understanding of the narratives, and children's performance varies depending on their perception of the robots (peer vs. adult) in the two conditions.","2017-07-12","2021-02-11 03:48:26","2021-02-11 03:48:26","","1-14","","","4","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND Publisher: FRONTIERS MEDIA SA Type: Article","","","","","emotional intelligence; socially assistive robotics; individual differences; multiparty interaction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, RAT using humanoid robots is still a novel practice for which the adhesion mechanisms, indications and benefits remain unclear. Also, little is known about how the robot's behavioral and affective style might promote engagement of persons with dementia (PwD) in RAT. The present study sought to investigate the use of a humanoid robot in a psychomotor therapy for PwD. We examined the robot's potential to engage participants in the intervention and its effect on their emotional state. A brief psychomotor therapy program involving the robot as the therapist's assistant was created. For this purpose, a corpus of social and physical behaviors for the robot and a “control software” for customizing the program and operating the robot were also designed. Particular attention was given to components of the RAT that could promote participant's engagement (robot's interaction style, personalization of contents). In the pilot assessment of the intervention nine PwD (7 women and 2 men, M age = 86 y/o) hospitalized in a geriatrics unit participated in four individual therapy sessions: one classic therapy (CT) session (patient-therapist) and three RAT sessions (patient-therapist-robot). Outcome criteria for the evaluation of the intervention included: participant's engagement, emotional state and well-being; satisfaction of the intervention, appreciation of the robot, and empathy-related behaviors in human-robot interaction (HRI). Results showed a high constructive engagement in both CT and RAT sessions. More positive emotional responses in participants were observed in RAT compared to CT. RAT sessions were better appreciated than CT sessions. The use of a social robot as a mediating tool appeared to promote the involvement of PwD in the therapeutic intervention increasing their immediate wellbeing and satisfaction.","2017-06-30","2021-02-11 03:48:26","2021-02-11 03:48:26","","","","","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND Publisher: FRONTIERS MEDIA SA Type: Article","","","","","engagement; social robots; control software; dementia; geriatrics; psychomotor therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Objective: The aim of this study was to find technological solutions that meet the needs of mothers during the year following childbirth. Methods: Two co-creation workshops were undertaken with parents and professionals. The aim of the first workshop was to create a list of all the criteria the proposed solution would have to address to meet the needs of mothers after childbirth. The aim of the second workshop was to create solutions in response to the criteria selected during the first workshop. Results: Parents and health professionals want solutions that include empathy (ie, to help fight against the feelings of abnormality and loneliness), that help mothers in daily life, that are personalized and adapted to different situations, that are educational, and that assures some continuity in their contact with health professionals. In practice, we found that parents and professionals think the solution should be accessible to everyone and available at all times. To address these criteria, technology experts proposed different solutions, such as a forum dedicated to the postpartum period that is supervised by professionals, a centralized website, a system of videoconferencing, an online exchange group, a “gift voucher” system, a virtual reality app, or a companion robot. Conclusions: The human component seems to be very important during the postnatal period. Nevertheless, technology could be a great ally in helping mothers during the postpartum period. Technology can help reliably inform parents and may also give them the right tools to find supportive people. However, these technologies should be tested in clinical trials.","2017-05","2021-02-11 03:48:26","2021-02-11 03:48:26","","","","5","6","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 59 WINNERS CIRCLE, TORONTO, ON M4L 3Y7, CANADA Publisher: JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC Type: Article","","","","","co-creating workshop; co-creation; mothers' needs; postpartum needs; technological solutions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It should also try to establish a social empathic relation with the user. To this aim, it is crucial to endow the robot with the capability of recognizing the user's affective state and reason on it for triggering the most appropriate communicative behavior. In this paper we describe how such an affective reasoning has been implemented in the NAO robot for simulating empathic behaviors in the context of AAL. In particular, the robot is able to recognize the emotion of the user by analyzing communicative signals extracted from speech and facial expressions. The recognized emotion allows triggering the robot's affective state and, consequently, the most appropriate empathic behavior. The robot's empathic behaviors have been evaluated both by experts in communication and through a user study aimed at assessing the perception and interpretation of empathy by elderly users. Results are quite satisfactory and encourage us to further extend the social and affective capabilities of the robot.","2017-02","2021-02-11 03:48:26","2021-02-11 03:48:26","","5073-5094","","4","76","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article","","","","","Empathy; Affective computing; Social assistive robots","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Meanwhile, counselors to help them are lack in number. To solve the problem, we proposed a counseling agent (CA) called CRECA (context respectful counseling agent). CRECA listens to clients and promotes their reflection context respectfully namely in a context preserving way. This agent can be enhanced using a body language called “unazuki” in Japanese, a kind of “nodding” to greatly promote dialogue, often accompanying “un-un” (meaning “exactly”) of Japanese onomatopoeia. This body language is expected to significantly help represent empathy or entire approval. In this paper, the agent is integrated with such a “unazuki” or “dialog promotion nodding” robot to continue the conversation naturally or context respectfully towards clients' further reflection. To realize such “unazuki”, the robot nods twice at each end of dialog sentence input by clients. Here, we introduce our newly developed robot that behaves human-like by an appropriate nodding behavior. The main motivation for developing a more human-like robot was the extension of application fields from IT workers' counselling to people, who suffers from more social problems such as financial debt, or anxiety of victory or defeat. For such applications, it is often very important that the agent behaves as much as possible human-like. Finally, we present the experimental evaluation results that proves such nodding is effective in counseling.","2017","2021-02-11 03:48:27","2021-02-11 03:48:27","","56-62","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: IEEE Comp Soc; Malaviya Natl Inst Technol; Univ Bourgogne; Univ Milan; Univ Bourgogne, Lab Electronique Image Informatique Res Grp; Natl Res Ctr Italy, Inst High Performance Comp & Networking; Govt Rajasthan, Dept Sci & Technol; IEEE Comp Soc, Special Interest Grp Semant Multimedia Management; ACM Special Interest Grp Appl Comp, French Chapter; IFIP; ACM Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>13th International Conference on Signal-Image Technology and Internet-Based Systems (SITIS), Jaipur, INDIA, DEC 04-07, 2017</p>","","","","Robot; Counseling; Dialog Promotion; Nodding; unazuki","Yetongnon, K and Dipanda, A and Chbeir, R and Gallo, L and Nain, N","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As the breath of robots applications requiring human interaction grow, it is important for robots to acquire sophisticated social skills such as empathy towards pain. However, it turns out that this is difficult to achieve without having an appropriate concept of pain that relies on robots being aware of their own body machinery aspects. This paper introduces the concept of pain, based on the ability to develop a state of awareness of robots own body and the use of the fault detection approach to generate artificial robot pain. Faults provide the stimulus and defines a classified magnitude value, which constitutes artificial pain generation, comprised of synthetic pain classes. Our experiment evaluates some of synthetic pain classes and the results show that the robot gains awareness of its internal state through its ability to predict its joint motion and generate appropriate artificial pain. The robot is also capable of alerting humans whenever a task will generate artificial pain, or whenever humans fails to acknowledge the alert, the robot can take a considerable preventive actions through joint stiffness adjustment.","2017","2021-02-11 03:48:27","2021-02-11 03:48:27","","694-699","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: Inst Elect & Elect Engineers; Inst Elect & Elect Engineers Robot & Automat Soc; Harbin Inst Technol; Beijing Inst Technol; Univ Nevada; Univ Electro Commun Tokyo; Chinese Univ Hong Kong; Chinese Acad Sci Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>IEEE International Conference on Real-time Computing and Robotics (RCAR), Okinawa, JAPAN, JUL 14-18, 2017</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

CRECA listens to clients and promotes their reflection context respectfully namely in a context preserving way. This agent can be enhanced using a body language called “unazuki” in Japanese, a kind of “nodding” to greatly promote dialogue, often accompanying “un-un” (meaning “exactly”) of Japanese onomatopoeia. This body language is expected to significantly help represent empathy or entire approval. In this paper, the agent is integrated with such a “unazuki” or “dialog promotion nodding” robot to continue the conversation naturally or context respectfully towards clients' further reflection. To realize such “unazuki”, the robot nods twice at each end of dialog sentence input by clients. The experimental evaluation proves such nodding is effective in counseling.","2017","2021-02-11 03:48:27","2021-02-11 03:48:27","","1540-1545","","","","","","","IEEE International Conference on Systems Man and Cybernetics Conference Proceedings","","","","IEEE","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: IEEE ISSN: 1062-922X Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC), Banff, CANADA, OCT 05-08, 2017</p>","","","","Robot; Counseling; Dialog Promotion; Nodding; unazuki","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A model of empathy in engineering as a core skill, as a practice orientation and a professional way of being that can be taught in university programs has been proposed [1]. Does an emotional intelligence model of empathy need to be taught earlier than at the university level? The engineering design process has been included in the science standards for k-12 schools since 2013[2]. One of the purposes of this inclusion is the ability to reach a diverse population of students by applying real world problems in their curriculum. The design process typically includes the steps of defining the engineering problem, developing solutions and optimizing the design. Although the word “empathy” is not used, these problems are defined from an empathetic perspective as “situations people want to change” of “social and global significance.” However, the standards do not discuss how to define a problem or how to teach empathy. In the winter of 2016 a study was conducted to evaluate the influence of empathy based lessons on girls' interest in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). Some information is known about empathy in lessons. Girls may be more interested if lessons are altered to include an element of caring [3]. Other studies indicate children's empathy increases with type of media provided in lesson (computer versus robot) [4]. The study in this article was a qualitative case study of 50 children, grades 6, 7, and 8, boys and girls in an after-school 4-H Science Club. The lessons were conducted once per week. The lessons were previously conducted in an all-girls after-school STEM program with similar available inexpensive materials. Both schools had similar demographics. The students and coordinators(instructors) were observed, pre- and post-surveys were conducted, and interviews of both students and coordinators were audio and/or video-taped. Although responses varied by lesson, initial results indicate many students and coordinators did not understand the meaning of empathy situated in engineering design.","2017","2021-02-11 03:48:27","2021-02-11 03:48:27","","","","","","","","","Frontiers in Education Conference","","","","IEEE","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: IEEE; IEEE ASEE; IEEE Comp Soc; Indian ISSN: 0190-5848 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE), Indianapolis, IN, OCT 18-21, 2017</p>","","","","empathy; design process; after-school science club; engineering; middle school","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An infant is often influenced by social referencing, meaning that they perceive their parents' interpretation about emotional situations to form their own interpretation. Similar to the infant development case, robots can be designed to generate representative emotional behaviors using self-organized neural networks trained with various emotional behavior samples from human partners.

In our previous studies, we have focused only on the robot's emotional state. However, the emotional state of the other party is also an important factor for smooth conversation in human society. Therefore, the robot partner has two emotional structures for human: empathy and robot emotion. First, human empathy uses a perceptual based emotion model to know the human's emotional state based on the sensory information. Next, we propose a recurrent simple spike response model to improve the robot's emotional model, and we apply “Hebbian-LMS” learning to modify the weights in the spiking neural network. The robot's emotional state is calculated by using the human's emotional information, internal and external information. The robot partner can use the emotional results to control the facial and gesture expression. The utterance style is also changed by the robot's emotional state. As a result, the robot partner can interact emotionally and naturally with human. First, we explain the related works and the development of the robot partner “iPhonoid-C”. Next, we define the architecture of the emotional model to realize emotional empathy towards human. Then, we discuss the algorithms and the methods for developing the emotional model. Finally, we show experimental results of the proposed method, and discuss the effectiveness of the proposed structure.","2017","2021-02-11 03:48:27","2021-02-11 03:48:27","","258-285","","4","30","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: UNIV MALAYA, FAC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECH, KUALA LUMPUR, 50603, MALAYSIA Publisher: UNIV MALAYA, FAC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECH Type: Article","","","","","Conversation System; Emotional Empathy Model; Hebbian-LMS Learning; Recurrent Spiking Neural Network; Robot Partner","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For artificial agents without emotional intelligence might generate behavior that is misinterpreted, unexpected, and confusing to humans, violating human expectations and possibly causing emotional harm. Surprisingly, there is a dearth of investigations aimed at understanding the extent to which artificial agents need emotional intelligence for successful interactions. Here, we present the first study in the perception of emotional intelligence (EI) in robots vs. humans. The objective was to determine whether people viewed robots as more or less emotionally intelligent when exhibiting similar behaviors as humans, and to investigate which verbal and nonverbal communication methods were most crucial for human observational judgments. Study participants were shown a scene in which either a robot or a human behaved with either high or low empathy, and then they were asked to evaluate the agent's emotional intelligence and trustworthiness. The results showed that participants could consistently distinguish the high EI condition from the low EI condition regardless of the variations in which communication methods were observed, and that whether the agent was a robot or human had no effect on the perception. We also found that relative to low EI high EI conditions led to greater trust in the agent, which implies that we must design robots to be emotionally intelligent if we wish for users to trust them.","2017","2021-02-11 03:48:27","2021-02-11 03:48:27","","129-141","","","10498","","","","Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence","","","","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: KTH Royal Inst Technol ISSN: 0302-9743 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>17th International Conference on Intelligent Virtual Agents (IVA), Swedish Natl Museum Sci &amp; Technol, Stockholm, SWEDEN, AUG 27-30, 2017</p>","","","","emotional intelligence; Human-robot interaction; empathetic robot","Beskow, J and Peters, C and Castellano, G and OSullivan, C and Leite, I and Kopp, S","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Current commercially-available RPSs, the most commonly used humanoid robots worldwide, are substantially limited in their usability and fidelity due to the fact that they lack one of the most important clinical interaction and diagnostic tools: an expressive face. Using autonomous facial synthesis techniques, we synthesized pain both on a humanoid robot and comparable virtual avatar. We conducted an experiment with 51 clinicians and 51 laypersons (n = 102), to explore differences in pain perception across the two groups, and also to explore the effects of embodiment (robot or avatar) on pain perception. Our results suggest that clinicians have lower overall accuracy in detecting synthesized pain in comparison to lay participants. We also found that all participants are overall less accurate detecting pain from a humanoid robot in comparison to a comparable virtual avatar, lending support to other recent findings in the HRI community. This research ultimately reveals new insights into the use of RPSs as a training tool for calibrating clinicians' pain detection skills.","2017","2021-02-11 03:48:27","2021-02-11 03:48:27","","32-41","","","","","","","ACM IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction","","","","IEEE","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: Assoc Comp Machinery; IEEE; ACM SIGCHI; ACM SIGAI; IEEE Robot & Automat Soc; AAAI; HFES ISSN: 2167-2121 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>12th Annual ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), Vienna, AUSTRIA, MAR 06-09, 2017</p>","","","","emotion; affective communication; social robots; facial expressions; humanoid robots; human robot interaction; health informatics; medical technologies; non-verbal communication; patient simulation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many types of communication robots and pet robots have been developed as communication partners for patients. The user's emotions are stimulated during direct communication with the robot, although there is less chance that the robot will approach the user in other situations such as watching TV and listening to music without disturbing him or her. The user feels that the robot is troublesome during the user's other tasks. The purpose of this research is to elevate the user's emotional experience through emotional expression by physiological expressions of a partner robot in the user's daily life. Ambient but emotional expressions of physiological phenomena are perceived by touch, even when the user is concentrating on other tasks. First, we focused on breathing, heartbeat and body temperature as the physiological phenomena. From the results of the evaluations of the robot's heartbeat and body temperature, along with our previous results for the breathing, each expression has arousal and pleasure axes of the robot's situation. In this paper, we focus on the joint attention of the robot and user to an emotional photograph, and we verified whether the strength of the user's own emotional response to the content was changed by the physiological expressions of the robot while they looked at photographs together. The results suggest that the physiological expression of the robot would make the common emotional experience of users the user's own emotion in the experience more excited and more relaxed.","2017","2021-02-11 03:48:27","2021-02-11 03:48:27","","505-509","","","","","","","","","","","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: Assoc Comp Machinery Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>5th International Conference on Human Agent Interaction (HAI), Excellence Ctr Cognit Interact Technol, Bielefeld, GERMANY, OCT 17-20, 2017</p>","","","","empathy; emotional expressions; enhancing users' emotion; Physiological phenomena; stuffed-toy robot","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such an ability depends critically on seven types of competencies. First, intrinsic morality should be grounded in the internal values of the robot arising from its physiology and embodiment. Second, the moral principles of robots should develop through their interactions with the environment and with other agents. Third, we claim that the dynamics of moral (or social) emotions closely follows that of other non-social emotions used in valuation and decision making. Fourth, we explain how moral emotions can be learned from the observation of others. Fifth, we argue that to assess social interaction, a robot should be able to learn about and understand responsibility and causation. Sixth, we explain how mechanisms that can learn the consequences of actions are necessary for a robot to make moral decisions. Seventh, we describe how the moral evaluation mechanisms outlined can be extended to situations where a robot should understand the goals of others. Finally, we argue that these competencies lay the foundation for robots that can feel guilt, shame and pride, that have compassion and that know how to assign responsibility and blame.","2016-10","2021-02-11 03:48:27","2021-02-11 03:48:27","","306-319","","5","24","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND Publisher: SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD Type: Article","","","","","empathy; Autonomous robots; embodied emotions; embodied interaction; intrinsic morality; sensory-motor grounding","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An understanding of emotional interactions would be essential to such robots' behavior. To improve the cognitive and behavior systems of such robots, we propose the use of an artificial topological consciousness that uses a synthetic neurotransmitter and motivation, including a biologically inspired emotion system. A fundamental aspect of a companion robot is a cross communication system that enables natural interactions between humans and the robot. This paper focuses on three points in the development of our proposed framework: (1) the organization of the behavior including inside-state emotion regarding the phylogenetic consciousness-based architecture; (2) a method whereby the robot can have empathy toward its human user's expressions of emotion; and (3) a method that enables the robot to select a facial expression in response to the human user, providing instant human-like `emotion' and based on emotional intelligence (El) that uses a biologically inspired topological online method to express, for example, encouragement or being delighted.

Altruistic tendencies, intended to benefit others with no apparent rewards, are also very useful for social robots that are designed to be used in our households. Yet, to make robots capable of learning how to help others as infants do, it is important to understand the mechanisms and motives responsible for the development of altruistic behavior. Further, understanding the mechanisms behind the early development of pro-social behavior would be a great contribution to the field of developmental psychology. To these ends, we hypothesize that infants from 14 months of age help others to minimize the differences between predicted actions and observations, that is, to minimize prediction errors. To evaluate our hypothesis, we created a computational model based on psychological studies and implemented it in real and simulated robots. Our system first acquires its own sensory-motor representation by interacting with its environment. Then, using its experience, the system recognizes and predicts others' actions and uses this prediction to estimate a prediction error. Our experiments demonstrated that our robots could spontaneously generate helping behaviors by being motivated by the minimization of prediction errors.","2016-09","2021-02-11 03:48:28","2021-02-11 03:48:28","","141-151","","3","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA Publisher: IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC Type: Article","","","","","prediction error; Altruistic behavior; cognitive developmental robotics; helping behavior","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The novelty of this method is that we analyze body motion-based features in frequency domain to estimate different human social patterns: Interpersonal Behaviors (IBs) and a Social Role (SR). To analyze the dynamics and interrelations of people's body motions, a human movement descriptor is used to extract discriminative features, and a multi-layer Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) technique is proposed to model the existent dependencies. Laban Movement Analysis (LMA) is a well-known human movement descriptor, which provides efficient mid-level information of human body motions. The mid-level information is useful to extract the complex interdependencies. The DBN technique is tested in different scenarios to model the mentioned complex dependencies. The study is applied for obtaining four IBs (Interest, Indicator, Empathy and Emphasis) to estimate one SR (Leading).

The current study investigates whether social interaction with a non-anthropomorphic robot is sufficient for a response of the MNS. Fifty-seven participants observed movements of a vacuum cleaning robot before and after it was handled by its owner. The robot was either humanized, being treated aggressively (n = 30), or it was treated as an object (n = 27). Electroencephalographic mu-activity is used as an index of MNS activity, because both are inversely correlated. Activity within the 8-13 Hz band was measured at central (mu activity) and occipital (alpha-activity) electrodes. Further, the level of aggressiveness displayed by the robot's owner, and the participants' compassion were rated on visual analog scales. Mu-activity showed medium-sized correlations with rated aggressiveness and compassion: The more aggressive the action towards the robot was perceived (r = -.379, p = .004), and the more compassion was felt for the robot (r = -.339, p = .010), the less pronounced mu-activity was at electrode C3 in response to the robot's movement. Thus social interaction with a non-anthropomorphic robot might establish the robot as a social entity and is sufficient to activate the human MNS. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Video clips depicting upper-body actions performed by three agents (human, android, and mechanical robot) were presented in experiment 1. In experiment 2, point-light motion (PLM) stimuli generated from experiment 1 stimuli were presented. The results of experiment 1 revealed that only the human and android actions evoked significant mu suppression. No PLM stimulus elicited significant mu suppression in experiment 2.

They verbally abused the robot, repeatedly obstructed its path, and sometimes even kicked and punched the robot. To investigate the reasons for the abuse, we conducted a field study in which we interviewed visiting children who exhibited serious abusive behaviors, including physical contact. We analyzed interview contents to determine whether the children perceived the robot as human-like, why they abused it, and whether they thought that the robot would suffer from their abusive behavior. We obtained valid interviews from 23 children (age range, 5-9 years old) over 13 days of observations. We found that 1) the majority of the children engaged in abuse because they were curious about the robot's reactions or enjoyed abusing it and considered it human-like, and 2) about half of them believed the robot was capable of perceiving their abusive behaviors.","2016","2021-02-11 03:48:28","2021-02-11 03:48:28","","348-370","","3","17","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: PO BOX 36224, 1020 ME AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS Publisher: JOHN BENJAMINS PUBLISHING CO Type: Article","","","","","children; abusive behavior; Communication robot; semi-structured interview","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We compare the performance of Support Vector Machines (SVM) and a Multilayer Perceptron Network (MLP) on facial expression classification. We employ Gabor filters as an image pre-processing step before classification. Our SVM model achieves an accuracy rate of 97.08 %, whereas our MLP achieves 93.5%.

The results showed that English compassion is characterised by more positive VALENCE and more of a desire to act than Polish wspolczucie. Polish empatia is also characterised by a more negative VALENCE than English empathy, which has a wider range of application. When used in positive contexts, English sympathy corresponds to Polish sympatia; however, it also acquires elements of negative VALENCE in English. The results further showed that although the processes of emotion recognition and expression in robotics must be tuned to culture-specific emotion models, the more explicit patterns of responsiveness (British English for the COMPASSION model in our case) is also recommended for the transfer to make the cognitive and sensory infocommunication more readily interpretable by the interacting agents.","2016","2021-02-11 03:48:28","2021-02-11 03:48:28","","65-70","","","","","","","International Conference on Cognitive Infocommunications","","","","IEEE","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: IEEE ISSN: 2375-1312 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>7th IEEE International Conference on Cognitive Infocommunications (CogInfoCom), Wroclaw, POLAND, OCT 16-18, 2016</p>","","","","emotions; empathy; expressiveness; action tendencies; affective robotics; British English; cognitive corpus linguistics; compassion; empatia; false negative; false positive; GRID; online sorting; Polish; responsiveness; sympathy; sympatia; VALENCE; wspolczucie","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this regard, many social robots based on reactive system have been developed to provide companionship for elderly adults with neurocognitive impairments such as dementia. However, these systems remain a problem such that no interactive dynamics of body gestures between human and robot has been considered. In this research, therefore, we developed a head motion synchronization system using mutual entrainment and implement it in a communication robot. This system was evaluated by conducting one-way face-to-face human-robot communication experiments with young native Japanese speakers under three conditions, namely unreactive, reactive and interactive conditions. Head motion synchrony analysis revealed a leader-follower relationship for the reactive model and a mutual entrainment of head motion for the interactive model. Also, questionnaire survey results showed the degree of empathy for interactive condition was significantly higher as compared with reactive and unreactive conditions. In addition, the degree of naturalness for interactive condition was significantly higher as compared with unreactive condition. Hence, these indicate that empathy was shared through mutual entrainment of head motion, which could provide a smooth interface in human-robot communication. This system would be extended to elderly adults as an assistive system for the elderly's rehabilitation.","2016","2021-02-11 03:48:29","2021-02-11 03:48:29","","1514-1519","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","English","","","","","","","Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>55th Annual Conference of the Society of Instrument and Control Engineers of Japan (SICE), Tsukuba, JAPAN, SEP 20-23, 2016</p>","","","","human-robot interaction; Head motion synchronization; mutual entrainment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To examine the effect quantitatively, we incorporated the task of cleaning up toy blocks. Performance was measured by the number of blocks children cleaned up. We compared results in three different cases: without the robot, with the robot programmed to take children's perspective in a moderate way, and with the robot programmed to take children's perspective in a strong or repeated way. The findings were very interesting. Perspective taking in both cases increased children's intimacy with the robot and enhanced cleaning performance.

This paper aims at exploring the phenomenon of responses to humor interventions from the robot through the examination of a corpus. We assume that using humor in human-robot interaction sets up a positive atmosphere in which participants are willing to contribute. This study relies on 49 human-robot interaction dialogues and 381 adjacency pairs of humorous acts made by the robot and the following human responses. The human humor responses, elicited through canned jokes and conversational humor, were annotated. Three main categories of human responses were found (1) providing no support, (2) recognizing the attempt of humor and (3) contributing with more humor. The findings indicate that, as in human-human interaction, strategies of humor support are strongly dependent of the humorous event's context.","2016","2021-02-11 03:48:29","2021-02-11 03:48:29","","305-316","","","9749","","","","Lecture Notes in Computer Science","","","","SPRINGER INT PUBLISHING AG","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","English","","","","","","","ISSN: 0302-9743 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>4th International Conference on Distributed, Ambient and Pervasive Interactions (DAPI) held as part of 18th International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI International), Toronto, CANADA, JUL 17-22, 2016</p>","","","","","Streitz, N and Markopoulos, P","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper we discuss, how cognitive biases such as misattribution, Empathy gap and Dunning-Kruger effects can play a role in robot-human interaction with the aim of improving long-term companionship. One of the robots used in this study called MARC (See Fig. 1) was given a series of biased behaviours such as forgetting participant's names, denying its own faults for failures, unable to understand what a participant is saying, etc. Such fallible behaviours were compared to a non-biased baseline behaviour. In the current paper, we present a comparison of two case studies using these biases and a non-biased algorithm. It is hoped that such humanlike fallible characteristics can help in developing a more natural and believable companionship between Robots and Humans. The results of the current experiments show that the participants initially warmed to the robot with the biased behaviours.","2016","2021-02-11 03:48:29","2021-02-11 03:48:29","","148-158","","","9979","","","","Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence","","","","SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN","HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: SoftBank Robot; Univ Kansas, Sch Engn; Springer ISSN: 0302-9743 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>8th International Conference on Social Robotics (ICSR), Kansas City, MO, NOV 01-03, 2016</p>","","","","Human-robot interaction; Cognitive bias in robot; Human-robot long-term interactions; Imperfect robot","Agah, A and Cabibihan, JJ and Howard, AM and Salichs, MA and He, H","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In facts, a principal defining characteristic of human social behaviour is empathy. The present paper presents a robotic architecture for an android robot as a basis for natural empathic human-android interaction. We start from the hypothesis that the robots, in order to become personal companions need to know how to empathic interact with human beings. To validate our research, we have used the proposed system with the minimalistic humanoid robot Telenoid. We have conducted human-robot interactions test with elderly people with no prior interaction experience with robot. During the experiment, elderly persons engaged a stimulated conversation with the humanoid robot. Our goal is to overcome the state of loneliness of elderly people using this minimalistic humanoid robot capable to exhibit a dialogue similar to what usually happens in real life between human beings. The experimental results have shown a humanoid robotic system capable to exhibit a natural and empathic interaction and conversation with a human user.","2016","2021-02-11 03:48:30","2021-02-11 03:48:30","","939-953","","","302","","","","Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing","","","","SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN","HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: Univ Padova ISSN: 2194-5357 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>13th International Conference on Intelligent Autonomous Systems (IAS), Centro Congressi Padova, Padova, ITALY, JUL 15-18, 2014</p>","","","","Humanoid robot; Humanoid robot interaction; Life support empathic robot; Telenoid","Menegatti, E and Michael, N and Berns, K and Yamaguchi, H","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The domain is a virtual robotic tutor who is guiding and helping learners through a mobile Treasure Hunt exercise that tests their map reading skills. The contribution described in this paper is the discovery that incorporating `memory' through utterances that recall events from previous interactions significantly increases the learner's ability to perform a pedagogical task. However, the virtual tutor with memory was perceived as less likeable and the instructions given as harder to follow than with a virtual tutor without memory. In addition, there was a significant drop in perceived empathy.

We performed electroencephalography in 15 healthy adults who observed either human- or robot-hand pictures in painful or non-painful situations such as a finger cut by a knife. We found that the descending phase of the P3 component was larger for the painful stimuli than the non-painful stimuli, regardless of whether the hand belonged to a human or robot. In contrast, the ascending phase of the P3 component at the frontal-central electrodes was increased by painful human stimuli but not painful robot stimuli, though the interaction of ANOVA was not significant, but marginal. These results suggest that we empathize with humanoid robots in late top-down processing similarly to human others. However, the beginning of the top-down process of empathy is weaker for robots than for humans.","2015-11-03","2021-02-11 03:48:30","2021-02-11 03:48:30","","","","","5","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND Publisher: NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, we conducted an exploratory study to empirically examine children's perceptions toward the computer- and robot-mediated AR systems designed to make dramatic play activities interactive and participatory. A multi-disciplinary expert group consisting of early childhood education experts, preschool teachers, AR specialists, and robot engineers collaborated to develop a learning scenario and technological systems for dramatic play. The experiment was conducted in a kindergarten setting in Korea, with 81 children (aged 5-6 years old). The participants were placed either in the computer-mediated AR condition (n = 40) or the robot-mediated AR condition (n = 41). We administered an instrument to measure children's perceived levels of the following variables: (a) satisfaction (i.e., interest in dramatic play & user-friendliness), (b) sensory immersion (i.e., self-engagement, environment-engagement & interaction-engagement), and (c) media recognition (i.e., collaboration with media, media function & empathy with media). Data analysis indicates that children in the robot-mediated condition showed significantly higher perceptions than those in the computer-mediated condition regarding the following aspects: interest in dramatic play (satisfaction), interactive engagement (sensory immersion), and empathy with media (media recognition). Furthermore, it was found that the younger-aged children and girls, in particular, perceived AR-infused dramatic play more positively than the older-aged children and boys, respectively. The contribution of this study is to provide empirical evidence about the affordances of robots and AR-based learning systems for young children. This remains a relatively unexplored area of research in the field of learning technologies. Implications of the current study and future research directions are also discussed.","2015-06","2021-02-11 03:48:30","2021-02-11 03:48:30","","455-474","","3","63","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article","","","","","Augmented reality; Dramatic play; Educational robot","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

On the one hand, we performed this study to assess the quality of the current facial expressions of two robot heads. On the other hand, we aimed at developing a simple, easy-to-use methodological variation to evaluate facial expressions of robotic heads. Short movie clips of two different robot heads showing a happy, sad, surprised, and neutral facial expression were compiled into an online survey, to examine how people interpret these expressions. Additionally, we added a control condition with a human face showing the same four emotions. The results showed that the facial expressions could be recognized well for both heads. Even the blender emotion surprised was recognized, although it resulted in positive and negative connotations. These results underline the importance of the situational context to correctly interpret emotional facial expressions. Besides the expected finding that the human is perceived significantly more anthropomorphic and animate than both robot heads, the more human-like designed robot head was rated significantly higher with respect to anthropomorphism than the robot head using animal-like features. In terms of the validation procedure, we could provide evidence for a feasible two-step procedure. By assessing the participants' dispositional empathy with a questionnaire it can be ensured that they are in general able to decode facial expressions into the corresponding emotion. In subsequence, robot facial expressions can be validated with a closed-question approach.","2015-02","2021-02-11 03:48:30","2021-02-11 03:48:30","","63-76","","1","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article","","","","","Human-robot interaction; Social robots; Facial expressions; Robot emotions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Its first dimension is auto-empathy and refers to an empathetic relationship with oneself: how can a human directing a robot expand the various components of empathy he feels for himself to this robot? The second is direct empathy: what does a human attribute to a robot in terms of thoughts, emotions, action potentials or even altruism, on the model of what he imagines and attributes to himself? The third dimension is reciprocal empathy that consists of thinking that a robot is able to identify with me, feel or guess my emotions and thoughts, anticipate my actions and wear me assistance if necessary. Finally, the fourth dimension, intersubjective empathy, is about thinking and imagining that a robot can inform me of things - emotions, thoughts that I am likely to experience- that I do not know about myself. Each of these four dimensions includes four different components: (1) Action (empathy of action), (2) Emotion (emotional empathy), (3) Cognition (cognitive empathy) and (4) Assistance (empathy of assistance). This theoretical model of empathy in four dimensions and four components defines sixteen items whose relevance will be tested in the near future through comparative experimental research involving human-human and human-robot interaction.","2015-02","2021-02-11 03:48:30","2021-02-11 03:48:30","","97-102","","1","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article","","","","","Psychology; Human-robot interaction; Auto-empathy; Direct empathy; Empathy with robots; Intersubjective empathy; Reciprocal empathy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Affective AutoTutor appears to behave empathically within a well defined learning environment. Third, attention is directed towards the requirements to be met by artificial empathizers to be judged as empathizers tout court by their social interactants, even when acting in unspecified social situations. To be a convincing empathizer, the artificial agent would not only need to grasp the emotional states of its interaction partners and understand their situation with respect to an adequate world model, but also communicate its own affective states. Eventually, an artificial empathizer should be ready to react appropriately to its interaction partner's reciprocal empathy.","2015-02","2021-02-11 03:48:30","2021-02-11 03:48:30","","111-116","","1","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article","","","","","Affective AutoTutor; Affective empathy; Artificial agent; Cognitive empathy; Empathic behavior","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They can interact with them with delight or retreat in aversion or fear. According to the famous model of the uncanny valley these opposite reactions depend on the degree of familiarity that different artifacts engender in humans. The aim of my work is trying to find out the cognitive bases of familiarity, analyzing the origin of anthropomorphic projection, namely human disposition to attribute anthropomorphic features - like intentions or feelings-to artifacts. I shall discuss two concepts: relatedness and empathy, and argue that relatedness is the precondition for empathy. The fact that it is possible to attribute anthropomorphic features virtually to any object shows that resemblance is not the point. Anthropomorphism is a kind of relation that humans establish with an artifact, and in order to comprehend this phenomenon we have to focus on the relational aspect. I shall argue that what we call anthropomorphism is an extension to nonhumans of forms of interactions typical of human communication, i.e. the attribution to an artifact of the position of interlocutor in a possible dialogue. It can be shown that attributing to an artifact the position of interlocutor in a dialogue implies dealing with it as if it were endowed of the features characterizing human mind, i.e. mental states and emotions.","2015-02","2021-02-11 03:48:31","2021-02-11 03:48:31","","117-127","","1","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article","","","","","Communication; Empathy; Theory of mind; Anthropomorphism; Relatedness","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is because empathic interactions with ordinary people are needed to introduce robots into our society. Several attempts have been made for specific situations. However, such attempts have provided several limitations; thus, diminishing authenticity. The present article proposes “affective developmental robotics (hereafter, ADR),” which provides more authentic artificial empathy based on the concept of cognitive developmental robotics (hereafter, CDR). First, the evolution and development of empathy as revealed in neuroscience and biobehavioral studies are reviewed, moving from emotional contagion to envy and schadenfreude. These terms are then reconsidered from the ADR/CDR viewpoint, particularly along the developmental trajectory of self-other cognition. Next, a conceptual model of artificial empathy is proposed based on an ADR/CDR viewpoint and discussed with respect to several existing studies.

What exactly is empathy, and why do most humans have it? We present a model which suggests that empathy is an emergent behavior with four main elements: a mirror neuron system, somatosensory cortices, an insula, and infant-directed “baby talk” or motherese. To test our hypothesis, we implemented a robot called MEI (multimodal emotional intelligence) with these functions, and allowed it to interact with human caregivers using comfort and approval motherese, the first kinds of vocalizations heard by infants at 3 and 6 months of age. The robot synchronized in real-time to the humans through voice and movement dynamics, while training statistical models associated with its low level gut feeling (”flourishing” or “distress”, based on battery or temperature). Experiments show that the post-interaction robot associates novel happy voices with physical flourishing 90 % of the time, sad voices with distress 84 % of the time. Our results also show that a robot trained with infant-directed “attention bids” can recognize adult fear voices. Importantly, this is the first emotion system to recognize adult emotional voices after training only with motherese, suggesting that this specific parental behavior may help build emotional intelligence.","2015-02","2021-02-11 03:48:31","2021-02-11 03:48:31","","35-49","","1","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article","","","","","Developmental robotics; Emotional contagion based on SIRE model; MEI robot; Robot empathy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is projected to design the model capable of different empathic responses (parallel and reactive) during the course of interaction with the user, depending upon the personality and mood factors of the robot. The proposed model encompasses three main stages i.e., perception, empathic appraisal and empathic expression. Perception refers to capturing user's emotion state via facial expression recognition. Empathic appraisal is based on the computational emotional model for generating its internal emotions, mood state and empathic responses. The internal emotions are defined using psychological studies and generated on 2D (pleasure-arousal) scaling model; whereas, fuzzy logic is used to calculate the intensity of the each emotion. A virtual facial expression simulator is applied for expression of resultant empathic emotions. Preliminary experimental results show that the proposed model is capable of exhibiting different empathic responses with respect to the personality and mood factors.","2015","2021-02-11 03:48:31","2021-02-11 03:48:31","","109-116","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: IEEE; IEEE Computational Intelligence Soc; IEEE BigData Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>IEEE Symposium Series Computational Intelligence, Cape Town, SOUTH AFRICA, DEC 07-10, 2015</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We measure the effects of lifelike movement and stories on people's hesitation to strike the robot, and we evaluate the relationship between hesitation and people's trait empathy. Our results show that people with a certain type of high trait empathy (empathic concern) hesitate to strike the robots. We also find that high empathic concern and hesitation are more strongly related for robots with stories. This suggests that high trait empathy increases people's hesitation to strike a robot, and that stories may positively influence their empathic responses.","2015","2021-02-11 03:48:31","2021-02-11 03:48:31","","770-775","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: IEEE; Robot Soc Japan; Korea Robot Soc; IEEE Robot & Automat Soc Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>24th IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (RO-MAN), Kobe, JAPAN, AUG 31-SEP 04, 2015</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is especially challenging to develop models that can predict choices made by an individual. However, as we approach having companion robots that have long-term relationships with a user, it becomes increasingly vital for the robot to be sensitive to the affect of the human and to behave in a manner that is consistent with the expectations of the user and society.

The robot's function is to increase people's awareness to the effect of their behavior towards others, potentially leading to behavior change. Specifically, Kip1 is designed to promote non-aggressive conversation between people. It monitors the conversation's nonverbal aspects and maintains an emotional model of its reaction to the conversation. If the conversation seems calm, Kip1 responds by a gesture designed to communicate curious interest. If the conversation seems aggressive, Kip1 responds by a gesture designed to communicate fear. We describe the design process of Kip1, guided by the principles of peripheral and evocative. We detail its hardware and software systems, and a study evaluating the effects of the robot's autonomous behavior on couples' conversations. We find support for our design goals. A conversation companion reacting to the conversation led to more gaze attention, but not more verbal distraction, compared to a robot that moves but does not react to the conversation. This suggests that robotic devices could be designed as companions to human-human interaction without compromising the natural communication flow between people. Participants also rated the reacting robot as having significantly more social human character traits and as being significantly more similar to them. This points to the robot's potential to elicit people's empathy.","2015","2021-02-11 03:48:31","2021-02-11 03:48:31","","3-10","","","","","","","ACM IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction","","","","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: IEEE; ACM; ACM SIGCHI; ACM SIGART; IEEE Robot & Automat Soc; AAAI; HFES; ACM SIGAI ISSN: 2167-2121 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>10th Annual ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), Portland, OR, MAR 02-05, 2015</p>","","","","Empathy; Human-robot interaction; Ambient kinetic tangibles; Behavior change; Design; Robotic companions; Smartphone robots","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The system relies on the learning by teaching paradigm to build an interaction, so as to stimulate meta-cognition, empathy and increased self-esteem in the child user. We hypothesise that use of a humanoid robot in such a system could not just engage an unmotivated student, but could also present the opportunity for children to experience physically-induced bene fits encountered during human-led handwriting interventions, such as motor mimicry. By leveraging simulated handwriting on a synchronised tablet display, anao humanoid robot with limited fine motor capabilities has been con figured as a suitably embodied handwriting partner. Statistical shape models derived from principal component analysis of a dataset of adult-written letter trajectories allow the robot to draw purposefully deformed letters. By incorporating feedback from user demonstrations, the system is then able to learn the optimal parameters for the appropriate shape models. Preliminary in situ studies have been conducted with primary school classes to obtain insight into children's use of the novel system. Children aged 6-8 successfully engaged with the robot and improved its writing to a level which they were satisfied with. The validation of the interaction represents a significant step towards an innovative use for robotics which addresses a widespread and socially meaningful challenge in education.","2015","2021-02-11 03:48:32","2021-02-11 03:48:32","","83-90","","","","","","","ACM IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction","","","","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: IEEE; ACM; ACM SIGCHI; ACM SIGART; IEEE Robot & Automat Soc; AAAI; HFES; ACM SIGAI ISSN: 2167-2121 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>10th Annual ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), Portland, OR, MAR 02-05, 2015</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A group of participants is used to evaluate how imitation by a robot affects people's perception of their conversation with it. A set of twelve questions about the participants' university experience serves as a backbone for the dialogue structure. In our experimental evaluation, the robot reacts in one of three ways to the human upper body pose: ignoring it, displaying its own upper body pose, and mirroring it. The manner in which the robot behaviour influences human appraisal is analysed using the standard Godspeed questionnaire. Our results show that robot body mirroring/non-mirroring influences the perceived humanness of the robot. The results also indicate that body pose mirroring is an important factor in facilitating rapport and empathy in human social interactions with robots.","2015","2021-02-11 03:48:32","2021-02-11 03:48:32","","214-223","","","9388","","","","Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence","","","","SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN","HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY","English","","","","","","","ISSN: 0302-9743 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>7th International Conference on Social Robotics (ICSR), Paris, FRANCE, OCT 26-30, 2015</p>","","","","Empathy; Anthropomorphism; Body-pose mirroring; Rapport","Tapus, A and Andre, E and Martin, JC and Ferland, F and Ammi, M","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our approach to uphold PD patient dignity is through the use of an ethical robot that mediates patient shame when it recognizes norm violations in the patient-caregiver interaction. This paper presents the basis for a computational model tasked with computing patient shame and the empathetic response of a caregiver during “empathetic opportunities” in their interaction. A PD patient is liable to suffer indignity when there is a substantial difference between his experienced shame and the empathy shown by the caregiver. When this difference falls outside of acceptable set bounds (norms), the robotic agent will act using subtle, nonverbal cues to guide the relationship back within these bounds, preserving patient dignity.","2015","2021-02-11 03:48:32","2021-02-11 03:48:32","","532-542","","","9388","","","","Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence","","","","SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN","HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY","English","","","","","","","ISSN: 0302-9743 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>7th International Conference on Social Robotics (ICSR), Paris, FRANCE, OCT 26-30, 2015</p>","","","","","Tapus, A and Andre, E and Martin, JC and Ferland, F and Ammi, M","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, it is important to consider how interaction with a simulated robot differs from a real robot; that is, do simulated robots provide authentic interaction? We contribute to a growing body of work that explores this question and maps out simulated-versus-real differences, by explicitly investigating empathy: how people empathize with a physical or simulated robot when something bad happens to it. Our results suggest that people may empathize more with a physical robot than a simulated one, a finding that has important implications on the generalizability and applicability of simulated HRI work. Empathy is particularly relevant to social HRI and is integral to, for example, companion and care robots.

This mimicry occurs even though these participants find the android unsettling and are fully aware that it lacks intentionality. Interestingly, a video of that same android elicits weaker mimicry reactions, occurring only in participants who find the android “humanlike.” These findings suggest that spontaneous mimicry depends on the salience of humanlike features highlighted by face-to-face contact, emphasizing the role of presence in human-robot interaction. Further, the findings suggest that mimicry of androids can dissociate from knowledge of artificiality and experienced emotional unease. These findings have implications for theoretical debates about the mechanisms of imitation.

In line with the Media Equation, humans may react towards robots as they do towards humans, making it all the more important to carefully investigate the preconditions and consequences of contact with robots. Based on assumptions on the socialness of reactions towards robots, we conducted a study that provides further insights into the question of whether humans show emotional reactions towards a robot and whether these reactions differ from those towards a human. To explore emotionality in human-robot interaction we conducted an fMRI study (n = 14). Participants were presented videos showing a human, a robot and an inanimate object, being treated in either an affectionate or in a violent way. Self-reported emotional states and functional imaging data revealed that participants indeed reacted emotionally when seeing the affectionate and violent videos. While no different neural activation patterns emerged for the affectionate interaction towards both, the robot and the human, we found differences in neural activity when comparing only the videos showing abusive behavior indicating that participants experience more emotional distress and show negative empathetic concern for the human in the abuse condition. This was supported by similar findings with regard to participant's self-reported emotional states. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Hence, we advocate the idea that social referencing can be bootstrapped from a simple sensory-motor system not dedicated to social interactions.","2014-03","2021-02-11 03:48:33","2021-02-11 03:48:33","","42-55","","1","6","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA Publisher: IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC Type: Article","","","","","Emotion; human-robot interaction; social referencing; sensory-motor architecture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Robots without functional abilities in understanding others and unable to empathise might be a societal risk and they may lead to a society of socially impaired robots. In this work we provide a survey of three relevant human social disorders, namely autism, psychopathy and schizophrenia, as a means to gain a better understanding of social robots' future capability requirements. We provide evidence supporting the idea that social robots will require a combination of emotional intelligence and social intelligence, namely socio-emotional intelligence. We argue that a robot with a simple socio-emotional process requires a simulation-driven model of intelligence. Finally, we provide some critical guidelines for designing future socio-emotional robots.","2014","2021-02-11 03:48:33","2021-02-11 03:48:33","","350-359","","","8755","","","","Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence","","","","SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN","HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: Journal Artificial Intelligence; Aldebaran Robot; Assoc Advancement Artificial Intelligence; Robohub; Stanford Ctr Legal Informat (CodeX) ISSN: 0302-9743 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>6th International Conference on Social Robotics (ICSR), Univ Technol,Ctr Quantum Computat &amp; Intelligent Syst, Sydney, AUSTRALIA, OCT 27-29, 2014</p>","","","","empathy; social robots; autism; theory of mind; psychopathy; schizophrenia; simulation theory; socio-emotional intelligence","Beetz, M and Johnston, B and Williams, MA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using a non-anthropomorphic social robot and a simple counting game, we examine the effects that empathy-generating robot dialogue has on participant performance across three conditions. In the self-directed condition, the robot petitions the participant to reduce his or her performance so that the robot can avoid punishment. In the externally-directed condition, the robot petitions on behalf of its programmer so that its programmer can avoid punishment. The control condition does not involve any petitions for empathy. We find that externally-directed petitions from the robot show a higher likelihood of motivating the participant to sacrifice his or her own performance to help, at the expense of incurring negative social effects. We also find that experiencing these emotional dialogue events can have complex and difficult to predict effects, driving some participants to antipathy, leaving some unaffected, and manipulating others into feeling empathy towards the robot.","2014","2021-02-11 03:48:33","2021-02-11 03:48:33","","255-260","","","","","","","IEEE RO-MAN","","","","IEEE","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: IEEE; IEEE Robot & Automat Soc; Robot Soc Japan; Korea Robot Soc; IEEE Syst, Man & Cybernet Soc ISSN: 1944-9445 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>23rd IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (IEEE RO-MAN), Heriot Watt Univ, Edinburgh, SCOTLAND, AUG 25-29, 2014</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Called felicific calculus, this system would judge an action to be morally right or wrong based on several factors like the amount of pleasure it would provide and how much pain the action would inflict upon others. Because of its basis as a type of “moral mathematics” felicific calculus may be a viable candidate as a working ethical system for artificial intelligent agents. This paper examines the concepts of felicific calculus and Utilitarianism in the light of their possible application to artificial intelligence, and proposes methods for its adoption in an actual intelligent machine. In order to facilitate the calculations necessary for this moral system, novel approaches to synthetic pain, pleasure, and empathy are also proposed.","2014","2021-02-11 03:48:33","2021-02-11 03:48:33","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: IEEE Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>IEEE International Symposium on Ethics in Science, Technology and Engineering, Chicago, IL, MAY 23-24, 2014</p>","","","","Concept Learning; Intelligent Agents; Machine Learning; Perceptual Reasoning; Philosophical Foundations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ostensibly, such bonding is an empathic response on the part of the person toward the robot. However, as philosopher Catrin Misselhorn points out, it's conceptually problematic to say that people empathize with robots, for the social robots of the present arguably don't possess human-like emotions. To address this concern, Misselhorn proposes that empathy with robots is possible owing to a sort of interplay between perception and imagination that she calls “imaginative perception.” In this paper, I shall make a preliminary sketch of a conceptual framework that, I argue, serves as a clearer, more conceptually straight-forward alternative to imaginative perception. On this framework, empathy with social robots is the result of a kind of perceptual illusion, rather than the result of the imaginative perception of emotion.","2014","2021-02-11 03:48:33","2021-02-11 03:48:33","","171-177","","","273","","","","Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence and Applications","","","","IOS PRESS","NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","English","","","","","","","ISSN: 0922-6389 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>Conference on Robo-Philosophy - Sociable Robotics and the Future of Social Relations, Aarhus, DENMARK, AUG 20-23, 2014</p>","","","","emotion; empathy; sympathy; uncanny valley; imaginative perception","Seibt, J and Hakli, R and Norskov, M","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Atypical responsiveness to social rewards, which reinforce socially appropriate behavior in children, can potentially lead to a cascade of deficits in social behavior. Individuals with ASC often show diminished spontaneous mimicry of social stimuli in a natural setting. In the general population, mimicry is modulated both by the reward value and the sociality of the stimulus (i.e., whether the stimulus is perceived to belong to a conspecific or an inanimate object). Since empathy and autistic traits are distributed continuously in the general population, this study aimed to test if and how these traits modulated automatic mimicry of rewarded social and nonsocial stimuli. High and low rewards were associated with human and robot hands using a conditioned learning paradigm. Thirty-six participants from the general population then completed a mimicry task involving performing a prespecified hand movement which was either compatible or incompatible with a hand movement presented to the participant. High autistic traits (measured using the Autism Spectrum Quotient, AQ) predicted lesser mimicry of high-reward than low-reward conditioned human hands, whereas trait empathy showed an opposite pattern of correlations. No such relations were observed for high-reward vs. low-reward conditioned robot hands. These results demonstrate how autistic traits and empathy modulate the effects of reward on mimicry of social compared to nonsocial stimuli. This evidence suggests a potential role for the reward system in underlying the atypical social behavior in individuals with ASC, who constitute the extreme end of the spectrum of autistic traits.

Based on social-psychological predictions of human behavior, the approach aims at inducing empathy, paired with a feeling of similarity in human users towards the robot. This is achieved by two differently expressed emotional control variables: by an explicit statement of similarity before task-related interaction, and implicitly expressed by adapting the emotional state of the robot to the mood of the human user, such that the current values of the human mood in the dimensions of pleasure, arousal, and dominance (PAD) are matched. The thereby shifted emotional state of the robot serves as a basis for the generation of task-driven emotional facial-and verbal expressions, employed to induce and sustain high empathy towards the robot throughout the interaction. The approach is evaluated in a user study utilizing an expressive robot head. The effectiveness of the approach is confirmed by significant experimental results. An analysis of the individual components of the approach reveals significant effects of explicit emotional adaption on helpfulness, as well as on the HRI-key concepts anthropomorphism and animacy.","2013-11","2021-02-11 03:48:34","2021-02-11 03:48:34","","457-476","","4","5","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article","","","","","Emotions; Empathy; Anthropomorphism; Adaption; Animacy; Helpfulness; Prosocial behavior; Similarity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Based on emerging psychological theories, we aim at building human-like emotional decision-making, where emotions play a central role in selecting the next action to be performed by the agent. Here, we present our own approach for emotion appraisal where we use emotional attachment as an important impulse for determining the intensities of emotions. Emotions in their turn are used to calculate the emotional attachment toward the users and for learning to predict future consequences. We report on the results of a simulation evaluation where we assess the influence of emotions, attachment, and learning on decision-making. It is our strong belief that by giving an agent the ability to have emotions and to feel empathy and emotional attachment toward others, we will ultimately give this agent the ability to learn and improve its social behavior skills through interactions with the users and through user feedback.

To achieve this, robots must interact with people in natural ways, employing social mechanisms that people use while interacting with each other. One such mechanism is empathy, often seen as the basis of social cooperation and prosocial behaviour. We argue that artificial companions capable of behaving in an empathic manner, which involves the capacity to recognise another's affect and respond appropriately, are more successful at establishing and maintaining a positive relationship with users. This paper presents a study where an autonomous robot with empathic capabilities acts as a social companion to two players in a chess game. The robot reacts to the moves played on the chessboard by displaying several facial expressions and verbal utterances, showing empathic behaviours towards one player and behaving neutrally towards the other. Quantitative and qualitative results of 31 participants indicate that users towards whom the robot behaved empathically perceived the robot as friendlier, which supports our hypothesis that empathy plays a key role in human robot interaction.

Young people, students, the higher educated, and men are more often found in the first two categories than in the third. The third attitudinal cluster is more skeptical when evaluating robots, while the first two clusters do not differ in their assessments, being equally appreciative. We evaluate critically the relevance of such survey-based classification for real-life decision situations, especially when people's answers about robots are not based on actual experiences of interaction with robots. Still, investigating the cultural construct of `robot' in present-day public imagination and uncovering its variability is potentially useful for technological designers, marketers, and policy-makers.","2013","2021-02-11 03:48:34","2021-02-11 03:48:34","","230-235","","","32","","","","Advances in Education Research","","","","INFORMATION ENGINEERING RESEARCH INST, USA","100 CONTINENTAL DR, NEWARK, DE 19713 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: Informat Engn Res Inst ISSN: 2160-1070 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>3rd International Conference on Social Sciences and Society (ICSSS), SOUTH KOREA, DEC 27-28, 2013</p>","","","","Survey research; Robots; Public imagination","Lee, G","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We attempt to apply a sociological and psychological approach to understand the influence of robot beings, by observing human emotion and perception changes while subjects watched a funny video clip in the presence of a robot or a human companion, each of which made their own typical laughing sounds. From this experiment, we found that the robot did not affect the human's positive emotions as much as a human companion did, but the robot did discourage negative emotions. However, the subjects were, in general, amused when they were watching the video with the robot. This amusement is similar to the contagious effect of sharing humor with another human being. Our findings suggest that the subjects accepted the robot's presence as a kind of existence empathically.","2013","2021-02-11 03:48:34","2021-02-11 03:48:34","","151+","","","","","","","ACM IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction","","","","IEEE","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: ACM; IEEE; IEEE Robot & Automat (RA); AAAI; Human Factors & Ergonom Soc (HFES); ACM SIGCHI; ACM SIGART ISSN: 2167-2121 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>8th Annual ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), Tokyo, JAPAN, MAR 03-06, 2013</p>","","","","social robot; empathy; robot companion; human robot interaction; emotional contagion; presence","Kuzuoka, H and Evers, V and Imai, M and Forlizzi, J","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Are mechanisms of action processing in the human brain specifically tuned to process biological agents? Humanoid robots can perform recognizable actions, but can look and move differently from humans, and as such, can be used in experiments to address such questions. Here, we recorded EEG as participants viewed actions performed by three agents. In the Human condition, the agent had biological appearance and motion. The other two conditions featured a state-of-the-art robot in two different appearances: Android, which had biological appearance but mechanical motion, and Robot, which had mechanical appearance and motion. We explored whether sensorimotor mu (8-13 Hz) and frontal theta (4-8 Hz) activity exhibited selectivity for biological entities, in particular for whether the visual appearance and/or the motion of the observed agent was biological. Sensorimotor mu suppression has been linked to the motor simulation aspect of action processing (and the human mirror neuron system, MNS), and frontal theta to semantic and memory-related aspects. For all three agents, action observation induced significant attenuation in the power of mu oscillations, with no difference between agents. Thus, mu suppression, considered an index of MNS activity, does not appear to be selective for biological agents. Observation of the Robot resulted in greater frontal theta activity compared to the Android and the Human, whereas the latter two did not differ from each other. Frontal theta thus appears to be sensitive to visual appearance, suggesting agents that are not sufficiently biological in appearance may result in greater memory processing demands for the observer. Studies combining robotics and neuroscience such as this one can allow us to explore neural basis of action processing on the one hand, and inform the design of social robots on the other.","2013","2021-02-11 03:48:35","2021-02-11 03:48:35","","","","","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND Publisher: FRONTIERS MEDIA SA Type: Article","","","","","EEG; social robotics; action perception; mirror neuron system; mu rhythm; theta rhythm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, insights into this topic are an important prerequisite when discussing, for example, ethical issues regarding the question of what role we (want to) allow robots to play in our lives. In line with the Media Equation, humans may react towards robots as they do towards humans, making it all the more important to carefully investigate the preconditions and consequences of contact with robots. Based on assumptions on the socialness of reactions towards robots and anecdotal evidence of emotional attachments to robots (e. g. Klamer and BenAllouch in Trappl R. (ed.), Proceedings of EMCSR 2010, Vienna, 2010; Klamer and BenAllouch in Proceedings of the 27th International Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI-2010), Atlanta, GA. ACM, New York, 2010; Kramer et al. in Appl. Artif. Intell. 25(6): 474-502, 2011), we conducted a study that provides further insights into the question of whether humans show emotional reactions towards Ugobe's Pleo, which is shown in different situations. We used a 2 x 2 design with one between-subjects factor “prior interaction with the robot” (never seen the robot before vs. 10-minute interaction with the robot) and a within-subject factor “type of video” (friendly interaction video vs. torture video). Following a multi-method approach, we assessed participants' physiological arousal and self-reported emotions as well as their general evaluation of the videos and the robot. In line with our hypotheses, participants showed increased physiological arousal during the reception of the torture video as compared to the normal video. They also reported fewer positive and more negative feelings after the torture video and expressed empathic concern for the robot. It appears that the acquaintance with the robot does not play a role, as “prior interaction with the robot” showed no effect.","2013-01","2021-02-11 03:48:35","2021-02-11 03:48:35","","17-34","","1","5","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article","","","","","Empathy; Human-robot interaction; Experimental study; Emotional response; Psychophysiological measures","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Korhonen et al. [2] state that the acceptance of a product depends not only on its utilitarian properties but also on non-utilitarian ones including playfulness. However, even if there seems to be near consensus on the importance of designing interactive systems beyond rational and functional requirements, the way in which this can be achieved is still an open research issue. In this paper we describe our design approach to develop an embodied and playful mobile interface to control a robot companion in a smart home environment. A major challenge of the research is to engage an older person in rich, empathic and playful interaction with a robot to encourage a prolonged, subtle, and stimulating effect beyond the initial encounter [3]. This challenge is explored through the design of innovative concepts of playful interaction embodying the perspective of the robot companion.","2013","2021-02-11 03:48:35","2021-02-11 03:48:35","","5-8","","","","","","","","","","","ALIFE ROBOTICS CO, LTD","3661-8 OAZA, SHIMOHANDA, OITA 870-1112, JAPAN","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: Int Symposium Artificial Life & Robot, Int Org Comm; Soc Instrument & Control Engineers; Robot Soc Japan; Inst Elect Engineers Japan; Inst Syst Control & Informat Engineers; Inst Elect Informat & Commun Engineers; IEEE Japan Council, IEEE Robot & Automat Soc, Japan Chapter; Japan Robot Assoc; Inst Control Robot & Syst; Chinese Assoc Artificial Intelligence Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>18th International Symposium on Artificial Life and Robotics (AROB), Daejeon, SOUTH KOREA, JAN 30-FEB 01, 2013</p>","","","","embodied interaction; graphical user interface; playful interaction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We recorded the eye movements and pupil sizes of 9- and 12-month-old infants and of adults (N = 14 per group) as they observed animation clips of biomechanically possible and impossible arm movements performed by a human and by a humanoid robot. Both 12-month-old infants and adults spent more time looking at the elbows during impossible compared with possible arm movements, irrespective of the appearance of the actor. These results suggest that by 12 months of age, infants recognize biomechanical constraints on how arms move, and they extend this knowledge to humanoid robots. Adults exhibited more pupil dilation in response to the human's impossible arm movements compared with the possible ones, but 9- and 12-month-old infants showed no differential pupil dilation to the same actions. This finding suggests that the processing of human body movements might still be immature in 12-month-olds, as they did not show an emotional response to biomechanically impossible body movements. We discuss these findings in relation to the hypothesis that perception of others' body movements relies upon the infant's own sensorimotor experience. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The findings suggest that the robots empathic behaviour affected positively how children perceived the robot.

While quite some progress has been made in e. g. speech or emotion understanding, processing and expressing, the relations between humans and robots are usually only short-term. In order to build long-term, i.e. social relations, qualities like empathy, trust building, dependability, non-patronizing, and others will be required. But these are just terms and as such no adequate starting points to “program” these capacities even more how to avoid the problems and pitfalls in interactions between humans and robots. However, a rich source for doing this is available, unused until now for this purpose: artistic productions, namely literature, theater plays, not to forget operas, and films with their multitude of examples. Poets, writers, dramatists, screen-writers, etc. have studied for centuries the facets of interactions between persons, their dynamics, and the related snags. And since we wish for human-robot relations as master-servant relations - the human obviously being the master - the study of these relations will be prominent. A procedure is proposed, with four consecutive steps, namely Selection, Analysis, Categorization, and Integration. Only if we succeed in developing robots which are seen as servants we will be successful in supporting and helping humans through robots.

For robots such as Nao, body language is the best medium available given their inability to convey facial expressions. Displaying emotional body language that can be interpreted whilst interacting with the robot should significantly improve its sociability. This research investigates the creation of an Affect Space for the generation of emotional body language to be displayed by robots. To create an Affect Space for body language, one has to establish the contribution of the different positions of the joints to the emotional expression. The experiment reported in this paper investigated the effect of varying a robot's head position on the interpretation, Valence, Arousal and Stance of emotional key poses. It was found that participants were better than chance level in interpreting the key poses. This finding confirms that body language is an appropriate medium for robot to express emotions. Moreover, the results of this study support the conclusion that Head Position is an important body posture variable. Head Position up increased correct identification for some emotion displays (pride, happiness, and excitement), whereas Head Position down increased correct identification for other displays (anger, sadness). Fear, however, was identified well regardless of Head Position. Head up was always evaluated as more highly Aroused than Head straight or down. Evaluations of Valence (degree of negativity to positivity) and Stance (degree to which the robot was aversive to approaching), however, depended on both Head Position and the emotion displayed. The effects of varying this single body posture variable were complex.","2010","2021-02-11 03:48:36","2021-02-11 03:48:36","","464-469","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: IEEE; Scuola Super SantAnna, CEIICP Inst; IEEE Inst Elect Soc (IES); IEEE Robot & Automat Soc (RA); IEEE Syst Man & Cybernet Soc (IEEE SMC); Robot Soc Japan (RSJ); EU SKILLS Integrated Project; IEEE Robot & Automat Soc, Italian Chapter (I-RAS); Korea Robot Soc (KROS); Movimento Italiano Modellist Simulazione (MIMOS); Soc Italiana Docenti Ricercatori Automat; Guger Technol (G.Tec); Aldebaran Robot Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>19th IEEE International Conference on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (RO-MAN), Viareggio, ITALY, SEP 13-15, 2010</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Without knowing that the other is an agent, the robot is able to learn some complex tasks if the human partner has some “empathy” or at least “resonate” with the robot head (low level emotional resonance).

Social interaction and its expressive implications (e.g., emotional contagion, empathy) is an extremely relevant component for analysis of expressive gesture, since it provides significant information on the context expressive gestures are performed in. However, most of the current systems analyze expressive gestures according to basic emotion categories or simple dimensional approaches. Moreover, almost all of them are intended for a single user, whereas social interaction is often neglected. After briefly recalling our pioneering studies on collaborative robot-human interaction, this paper presents two steps in the direction of novel computational models and techniques for measuring social interaction: (i) the interactive installation Mappe per Affetti Erranti for active listening to sound and music content, and (ii) the techniques we developed for explicitly measuring synchronization within a group of users.

In the present study, we examined whether an empathic chatbot can serve as a buffer against the adverse effects of social ostracism. After experiencing exclusion on social media, participants were randomly assigned to either talk with an empathetic chatbot about it (e.g., “I'm sorry that this happened to you”) or a control condition where their responses were merely acknowledged (e.g., “Thank you for your feedback”). Replicating previous research, results revealed that experiences of social exclusion dampened the mood of participants. Interacting with an empathetic chatbot, however, appeared to have a mitigating impact. In particular, participants in the chatbot intervention condition reported higher mood than those in the control condition.

However, the traditional use of didactic lectures for communication skills training is ineffective, and the use of standardized patients is not time- or cost-effective. Given the abilities of virtual patients (VPs) to simulate interactive and authentic clinical scenarios in secured environments with unlimited training attempts, a virtual counseling application is an ideal platform for nursing students to hone their communication skills before their clinical postings. Objective: The aim of this study was to develop and test the use of VPs to better prepare nursing undergraduates for communicating with real-life patients, their family members, and other health care professionals during their clinical postings. Methods: The stages of the creation of VPs included preparation, design, and development, followed by a testing phase before the official implementation. An initial voice chatbot was trained using a natural language processing engine, Google Cloud's Dialogflow, and was later visualized into a three-dimensional (3D) avatar form using Unity 3D. Results: The VPs included four case scenarios that were congruent with the nursing undergraduates' semesters' learning objectives: (1) assessing the pain experienced by a pregnant woman, (2) taking the history of a depressed patient, (3) escalating a bleeding episode of a postoperative patient to a physician, and (4) showing empathy to a stressed-out fellow final-year nursing student. Challenges arose in terms of content development, technological limitations, and expectations management, which can be resolved by contingency planning, open communication, constant program updates, refinement, and training. Conclusions: The creation of VPs to assist in nursing students' communication skills training may provide authentic learning environments that enhance students' perceived self-efficacy and confidence in effective communication skills. However, given the infancy stage of this project, further refinement and constant enhancements are needed to train the VPs to simulate real-life conversations before the official implementation.","2019-10-29","2021-02-11 04:00:01","2021-02-11 04:00:09","","","","10","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 130 QUEENS QUAY E, STE 1102, TORONTO, ON M5A 0P6, CANADA Publisher: JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC Type: Article","","","","","artificial intelligence; learning; communication; virtual reality; technology; nursing education; patients","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A useful thought experiment is the application of the Turing test to user-facing artificial intelligence systems in health care. In this paper I argue that many medical decisions require value judgements and the doctor-patient relationship requires empathy and understanding to arrive at a shared decision, often handling large areas of uncertainty and balancing competing risks. Arguably, medicine requires wisdom more than intelligence, artificial or otherwise. Artificial intelligence therefore needs to supplement rather than replace medical professionals, and identifying the complementary positioning of artificial intelligence in medical consultation is a key challenge for the future.

These requirements are also supported by specific laws in most countries. But such awareness does not yet reach the interfaces of conversational agents or chatbots that are being developed. Within the framework of the European project ACACIA, co-funded by the Erasmus+ program of the European Union, Artemisa, a chatbot has been created dedicated to fight against sexual harassment and search for volunteers to promote the acceptance of diversity and tolerance, has been created using a platform that facilitates the generation and management of this type of artificial intelligences. But to what extent Artemisa is an accessible chatbot or not? Is it ethically acceptable to make use of a tool that is intended to support inclusiveness but presents accessibility barriers to some users? What is the current state in terms of accessibility compliance of chatbots that work on social networks? This article seeks to answer this and other questions related to accessibility in Chatbots, conversational agents and virtual assistant's. Based on the answer to these questions it follows that there is a need for training in interculturalism and web accessibility to combat the biases that present such entities, which are endowed with artificial intelligence and, unfortunately, in some cases causing serious damage to some people.","2019","2021-02-11 04:00:01","2021-02-11 04:00:09","","8824-8833","","","","","","","EDULEARN Proceedings","","","","IATED-INT ASSOC TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION & DEVELOPMENT","LAURI VOLPI 6, VALENICA, BURJASSOT 46100, SPAIN","English","","","","","","","ISSN: 2340-1117 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>11th International Conference on Education and New Learning Technologies (EDULEARN), Palma, SPAIN, JUL 01-03, 2019</p>","","","","artificial intelligence; ethics; empathy; Conversational agents; accessibility; biases; Chatbot","Chova, LG and Martinez, AL and Torres, IC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is an interdisciplinary field which includes computer science, psychology and cognitive science. An inspiration for the research is the ability to simulate empathy when communicating with computers or in the future robots. This paper explored the potential of facial expression tracking with deep learning to make chatbots more emotionally aware through developing a post-therapy session survey chatbot which responds depending on two inputs, interactant's response and facial expression. The developed chatbot summarizes emotional state of the user during the survey through percentages of the tracked facial expressions throughout the conversation with the chatbot. Facial expression tracking for happy, neutral, and hurt had 66.7%, 16.7%, and 56.7% tracking accuracy, respectively. Moreover, the developed program was tested to track expressions simultaneously per second. It can track 17 expressions with stationary subject and 14 expressions with non-stationary subject in a span of 30 seconds.","2019","2021-02-11 04:00:01","2021-02-11 04:00:09","","160-163","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: IEEE; IEEE Computat Intelligence Soc; MIR MSREP; Smilegate; WCG; Inst Control Robot & Syst; Daejeon Int Marketing Enterprise; Korea Tourism Org Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>7th International Conference on Robot Intelligence Technology and Applications (RiTA), KAIST, Daejeon, SOUTH KOREA, NOV 01-03, 2019</p>","","","","deep learning; affective computing; emotionally aware technology; facial expression detection; scripted chatbot","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With a plethora of AI solutions around, the other person being targeted may be a conversational agent. In this study, involving 3 verbal abuse types (Insult, Threat, Swearing) and 3 response styles (Avoidance, Empathy, Counterattacking), we examine whether a conversational agent's response style under varying abuse types influences those emotions found to mitigate people's aggressive behaviors. Sixty-four participants, assigned to one of the abuse type conditions, interacted with the three conversational agents in turn and reported their feelings about guiltiness, anger, and shame after each session. Our study results show that, regardless of the abuse type, the agent's response style has a significant effect on user emotions. Participants were less angry and more guilty with the empathetic agent than the other two agents. Our study findings have direct implications for the design of conversational agents.","2019","2021-02-11 04:00:02","2021-02-11 04:00:09","","","","","","","","","","","","","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: Assoc Comp Machinery; ACM SIGCHI Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI), Glasgow, SCOTLAND, MAY 04-09, 2019</p>","","","","Chatbot; Agent Abuse; Agent Response Style; Conversational Agent; Conversational AI; Verbal Abuse","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, previous research reveals that users' expectations of what conversational agents can understand and do far outpace their actual technical capabilities. Our work seeks to bridge the gap between these expectations and reality by designing a fun learning experience with several goals: explaining how chatbots work by mapping utterances to a set of intents, teaching strategies for avoiding conversational breakdowns, and increasing desire to use chatbots by creating feelings of empathy toward them. Our experience, called BigBlueBot, consists of interactions with two chatbots in which breakdowns occur and the user (or chatbot) must recover using one or more repair strategies. In a Mechanical Turk evaluation (N=88), participants learned strategies for having successful human-agent interactions, reported feelings of empathy toward the chatbots, and expressed a desire to interact with chatbots in the future.","2019","2021-02-11 04:00:02","2021-02-11 04:00:09","","448-459","","","","","","","","","","","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: Assoc Comp Machinery Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>24th ACM International Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces (IUI), Los Angeles, CA, MAR 16-20, 2019</p>","","","","Mechanical Turk; conversational agents; Explainable AI","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although expression of caring and understanding is valued in supportive human communications, do we want the same from a chatbot, or do we simply reject it due to its artificiality and uncanniness? To answer this question, we conducted two experiments with a chatbot providing online medical information advice about a sensitive personal issue. In Study 1, participants (N=158) simply read a dialogue between a chatbot and a human user. In Study 2, participants (N=88) interacted with a real chatbot. We tested the effect of three types of empathic expressionsympathy, cognitive empathy, and affective empathyon individuals' perceptions of the service and the chatbot.

Evidence indicates that OT effects on human behavior are multifaceted, such as trust behavior, decrease anxiety, empathy and bonding behavior. For the vital role of mentalizing in understanding others, here we examine whether OT has a general effect on mentalizing brain network which is associated to the effect of related social behavioral and personality traits. Using a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled group design, we investigate the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging after intranasal OT or placebo. The functional connectivity (FC) maps with seed in left/right temporoparietal junction (lTPJ/rTPJ) showed that OT significantly increased connectivity between rTPJ and default attention network (DAN), but decreased the FC between lTPJ and medial prefrontal network (MPN). With machine learning approach, we report that identified altered FCs of TPJ can classify OT and placebo (PL) group. Moreover, individual's empathy trait can modulate the FC between left TPJ and right rectus (RECT), which shows a positive correlation with empathic concern in PL group but a negative correlation in OT group. These results demonstrate that OT has significant effect on FC with lTPJ and rTPJ, brain regions where are critical for mentalizing, and the empathy concern can modulate the FC. These findings advance our understanding of the neural mechanisms by which OT modulates social behaviors, especially in social interaction involving mentalizing.","2020-12","2021-02-11 04:02:13","2021-02-11 04:02:13","","2530-2541","","6","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article","","","","","fMRI; Functional connectivity; Mentalizing network; Oxytocin; Temporoparietal junction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The survey measured opinions about the likelihood future technology would fully replace physicians in performing ten key psychiatric tasks. This study involved qualitative descriptive analysis of written responses (”comments”) to three open-ended questions in the survey. Results Comments were classified into four major categories in relation to the impact of future technology on: (1) patient-psychiatrist interactions; (2) the quality of patient medical care; (3) the profession of psychiatry; and (4) health systems. Overwhelmingly, psychiatrists were skeptical that technology could replace human empathy. Many predicted that `man and machine' would increasingly collaborate in undertaking clinical decisions, with mixed opinions about the benefits and harms of such an arrangement. Participants were optimistic that technology might improve efficiencies and access to care, and reduce costs. Ethical and regulatory considerations received limited attention. Conclusions This study presents timely information on psychiatrists' views about the scope of artificial intelligence and machine learning on psychiatric practice. Psychiatrists expressed divergent views about the value and impact of future technology with worrying omissions about practice guidelines, and ethical and regulatory issues.","2020-10","2021-02-11 04:02:13","2021-02-11 04:02:13","","","","","6","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND Publisher: SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD Type: Article","","","","","machine learning; Artificial intelligence; mental health; attitudes; future; opinions; psychiatry; qualitative research; technology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper presents the experience of one aspect of artificial intelligence, machine learning, coupled with patient empathy to improve utilization of assisted reproductive technology (ART), which is an important aspect of care that is under-recognized. Although ART provides very effective options for infertile patients to build families, patients often discontinue ART when further treatment is likely to be beneficial and most of these patients do not achieve pregnancy without medical aid. Use of ART is only in part dependent on financial considerations; stress and other factors play a major role, as shown by high discontinuation rates despite reimbursement. This commentary discusses challenges and strategies to providing personalized ART prognostics based on machine learning, and presents a case study where appropriate use of such prognostics in ART centres is associated with a trend towards increased ART utilization.","2020-10","2021-02-11 04:02:13","2021-02-11 04:02:13","","573-577","","4","41","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND Publisher: ELSEVIER SCI LTD Type: Editorial Material","","","","","Machine learning; Artificial intelligence; ART utilization; IVF drop-outs; Patient empathy; Prognostication","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hundreds of genetic variants are expected to influence its complex development, but few have been identified. We used a machine learning method for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to uncover complex genotypic-phenotypic networks and environmental interactions. The Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) measured the self-regulatory components of personality critical for health (i.e., the character traits of self-directedness, cooperativeness, and self-transcendence). In a discovery sample of 2149 healthy Finns, we identified sets of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that cluster within particular individuals (i.e., SNP sets) regardless of phenotype. Second, we identified five clusters of people with distinct profiles of character traits regardless of genotype. Third, we found 42 SNP sets that identified 727 gene loci and were significantly associated with one or more of the character profiles. Each character profile was related to different SNP sets with distinct molecular processes and neuronal functions. Environmental influences measured in childhood and adulthood had small but significant effects. We confirmed the replicability of 95% of the 42 SNP sets in healthy Korean and German samples, as well as their associations with character. The identified SNPs explained nearly all the heritability expected for character in each sample (50 to 58%). We conclude that self-regulatory personality traits are strongly influenced by organized interactions among more than 700 genes despite variable cultures and environments. These gene sets modulate specific molecular processes in brain for intentional goal-setting, self-reflection, empathy, and episodic learning and memory.","2020-10","2021-02-11 04:02:14","2021-02-11 04:02:14","","2295-2312","","10","25","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND Publisher: SPRINGERNATURE Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Users, on a restaurant guide site, utilize IDs to post their recommendation articles on restaurants, and these posted articles are a valuable information source for other users. Open users can search for restaurants and read recommendation articles posted by other users. Furthermore, they can react (e.g., “like”) to a recommendation article when they feel it is helpful or they feel like visiting the restaurant. On a target restaurant guide site, each post includes the user ID, restaurant name, recommendation sentences, etc., and the number of reactions is considered to depend on these posted contents. For users who post recommendation articles, the number of reactions to their posts represents the degree of empathy from other users and is an important motivation for posting. Therefore, posting users will benefit from guidelines on how to write good recommendation sentences to increase the number of reactions. Moreover, the number of reactions can be regarded as an important indicator of the activity level of the restaurant guide site from the viewpoint of the service operating company. Therefore, an analytical model developed using historical information such as posts and reactions by users would be useful for determining the relationship between posted contents and the number of reactions. Therefore, this paper proposes a model based on the machine learning approach to analyze the relation between the number of reactions and posted contents. Finally, we demonstrate the analysis based on the proposed model using practical data.","2020-09","2021-02-11 04:02:14","2021-02-11 04:02:14","","669-679","","3","19","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: VICTORIA BLDG RM 509, 705-1 YEOKSAM-DONG, KANGNAM-GU, SEOUL, 135-080, SOUTH KOREA Publisher: KOREAN INST INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERS Type: Article","","","","","Machine Learning; Natural Language Processing; Business Analytics; Restaurant Guide","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To explore the neural interactions among reward and memory circuits, we applied effective connectivity analysis on resting-state fMRI data collected from cocaine-dependent subjects. The relationship between effective connectivity within these two important circuits and empathy ability - evaluated with the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) - was assessed by machine learning algorithm using multivariate regression analysis. In accordance with the neurocircuitry disruptions of cocaine addiction, the results showed that cocaine-dependent subjects relative to healthy controls had altered resting state effective connectivity between parts of the memory and reward systems. Furthermore, effective connectivity between the memory and reward system could predict the fantasy empathy (FE) subscale scores in cocaine dependence. Overall, our findings provide further evidence for the neural substrates of social cognition in cocaine-dependent patients. These new insights could be useful for the development of new treatment programs for this substance dependency disorder.","","2021-02-11 04:02:14","2021-02-11 04:02:14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article; Early Access","","","","","social cognition; cocaine dependence; effective connectivity; fantasy empathy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Machine learning is dramatically changing scientific research and industry and may also hold promise for addressing limitations encountered in mental health care and psychotherapy. The current paper introduces machine learning and natural language processing as related methodologies that may prove valuable for automating the assessment of meaningful aspects of treatment. Prediction of therapeutic alliance from session recordings is used as a case in point. Recordings from 1,235 sessions of 386 clients seen by 40 therapists at a university counseling center were processed using automatic speech recognition software. Machine learning algorithms learned associations between client ratings of therapeutic alliance exclusively from session linguistic content. Using a portion of the data to train the model, machine learning algorithms modestly predicted alliance ratings from session content in an independent test set (Spearman's rho =15, p <.001). These results highlight the potential to harness natural language processing and machine learning to predict a key psychotherapy process variable that is relatively distal from linguistic content. Six practical suggestions for conducting psychotherapy research using machine learning are presented along with several directions for future research. Questions of dissemination and implementation may be particularly important to explore as machine learning improves in its ability to automate assessment of psychotherapy process and outcome.","2020-07","2021-02-11 04:02:15","2021-02-11 04:02:15","","438-448","","4, SI","67","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA Publisher: AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC Type: Article","","","","","artificial intelligence; machine learning; methodology; natural language processing; therapeutic alliance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Parents, caretakers and doctors find it very difficult to prevent such extreme behaviors. Learning the positive and negative valence leads in determining the early indications before the onset of emotional outbursts in children with ASD. The present study measures the psycho physiological electrocardiogram (ECG) signal from the typically developed (TD) children and children with ASD in the age group of 5-11 years. Personalized protocol was developed for every child with ASD to induce positive and negative valence and ECG data was collected using wearable Shimmer ECG device. The heart rate variability (HRV) and the QRS amplitude were derived from ECG signal using Pan-Tompkins algorithm and eleven features were extracted using DWT (db2, db4 and db8) mother wavelet. The significant features of ECG, HRV and QRS amplitude were classified using the K nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM) and ensemble classifier. Ensemble and KNN classifier achieved maximum accuracy of 81% and 76.2% for children with ASD and Ensemble and SVM classifiers obtained maximum accuracy of 87.4% and 83.8% for TD children using HRV data.","","2021-02-11 04:02:15","2021-02-11 04:02:15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY Publisher: SPRINGER HEIDELBERG Type: Article; Early Access","","","","","Autism spectrum disorder (ASD); Heart rate variability (HRV); K nearest neighbor (KNN); Pan-Tompkins algorithm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The assessment of our psychological traits is a useful tool when we require them to simulate empathy. Since the creation of social media platforms, numerous studies dealt with measuring personality traits by gathering users' information from their social media profiles. Real world applications showed how natural language processing combined with supervised machine learning algorithms are effective in this field. These applications have some limitations such as focusing on English text only and not considering polysemy in text. In this paper, we propose a multilingual model that handles polysemy by analyzing sentences as a semantic ensemble of interconnected words. The proposed approach processes Facebook posts from the myPersonality dataset and it turns them into a high-dimensional array of features, which are then exploited by a deep neural network architecture based on transformer to perform regression. We prove the effectiveness of our work by comparing the mean squared error of our model with existing baselines and the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the relative data distributions.

An untested implication of this hypothesis is that these stable patterns of connectivity should be visible even in the absence of empathy tasks. Using machine learning, we demonstrate that patterns of resting state fMRI connectivity (i.e. the degree of synchronous BOLD activity across multiple cortical areas in the absence of explicit task demands) of resonance and control networks predict trait empathic concern (n = 58). Empathic concern was also predicted by connectivity patterns within the somatomotor network. These findings further support the role of resonance-control network interactions and of somatomotor function in our vicariously driven concern for others. Furthermore, a practical implication of these results is that it is possible to assess empathic predispositions in individuals without needing to perform conventional empathy assessments.","2020-02-14","2021-02-11 04:02:16","2021-02-11 04:02:16","","","","","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND Publisher: FRONTIERS MEDIA SA Type: Article","","","","","fMRI; resting state; machine learning; connectivity; empathy; empathic concern; experience sharing; mirroring","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This assessment, run entirely on a tablet, measures decision-making via a suite of neurocognitive tests in less than 30 minutes. The software measures several cognitive and decision-making traits of the user, including impulsivity, empathy, aggression, and several other traits linked to reoffending. Our analysis measured whether this assessment successfully predicted recidivism by testing probationers in a large urban city (Houston, TX, United States) from 2017 to 2019. To determine predictive validity, we used machine learning to yield cross-validated receiver-operator characteristics. Results gave a recidivism prediction value of 0.70, making it comparable to commonly used risk assessments. This novel approach diverges from traditional self-reporting, interview-based, and criminal-records-based approaches, and can also add a protective layer against bias, while strengthening model accuracy in predicting reoffense. In addition, subjectivity is eliminated and time-consuming administrative efforts are reduced. With continued data collection, this approach opens the possibility of identifying different levels of recidivism risk, by crime type, for any age, or gender, and seeks to steer individuals appropriately toward rehabilitative programs.

Mental health appears ripe for such disruption given the global illness burden, stigma, and shortage of care providers. Objective: To characterize the global psychiatrist community's opinion regarding the potential of future autonomous technology (referred to here as AI/ML) to replace key tasks carried out in mental health practice. Design: Cross sectional, random stratified sample of psychiatrists registered with Sermo, a global networking platform open to verified and licensed physicians. Main outcome measures: We measured opinions about the likelihood that AI/ML tools would be able to fully replace - not just assist - the average psychiatrist in performing 10 key psychiatric tasks. Among those who considered replacement likely, we measured opinions about how many years from now such a capacity might emerge. We also measured psychiatrist's perceptions about whether benefits of AI/ML would outweigh the risks. Results: Survey respondents were 791 psychiatrists from 22 countries representing North America, South America, Europe and Asia-Pacific. Only 3.8 % of respondents felt it was likely that future technology would make their jobs obsolete and only 17 % felt that future AI/ML was likely to replace a human clinician for providing empathetic care. Documenting and updating medical records (75 %) and synthesizing information (54 %) were the two tasks where a majority predicted that AI/ML could fully replace human psychiatrists. Female- and US-based doctors were more uncertain that the benefits of AI would outweigh risks than male- and non-US doctors, respectively. Around one in 2 psychiatrists did however predict that their jobs would be substantially changed by AI/ML. Conclusions: Our findings provide compelling insights into how physicians think about AI/ML which in turn may help us better integrate technology and reskill doctors to enhance mental health care.","2020-01","2021-02-11 04:02:17","2021-02-11 04:02:17","","","","","102","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS Publisher: ELSEVIER Type: Article","","","","","Deep learning; Empathy; Autonomous agents; Mental health","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although this promises to deliver increased speed and accuracy, the future role of AI in relation to radiotherapy should be thought through carefully. There is currently a gap between published developments and widespread adoption, which provides some space to prepare the workforce and to consider the implications on practice. It is rare to find philosophical input into a medical journal, but the advent of AI makes this perspective increasingly important. Philosophical insight can help explore the potential impact of AI, in particular, on human creativity and oversight. Without this perspective, we run the risk of focusing solely on the immediate logistical impact on patients and departments. This commentary identifies three key aspects of radiotherapy that the authors feel would suffer most under AI control: creativity, innovation, and patient safety, which all demand uniquely human attributes. The article also provides insight from a philosophical perspective with regard to human consciousness, ethics, and empathy. Philosophically we should, perhaps, retain ethical concerns about the widening role of AI in radiotherapy beyond simple quantitative interpretation and image processing. As developments continue, we have time to determine how our roles will evolve and to establish a framework for ensuring appropriate human input into patient care. Most importantly, we must start to embed a philosophical approach to adoption of AI technology from the outset if we are to prepare ourselves for the challenge that lies ahead.","2019-12","2021-02-11 04:02:17","2021-02-11 04:02:17","","S27-S31","","4, 2","50","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA Publisher: ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC Type: Editorial Material","","","","","Artificial intelligence; philosophy; radiotherapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to identify neural patterns that dissociate these two motivations. Participants played both the ultimatum and dictator game (UG-DG) as proposers. Because responders can reject the offer in the UG, but not the DG, offers and neural patterns between the games should differ for strategic players but not prosocial players. Using multivariate pattern analysis, we found that the decoding accuracy of neural patterns associated with UG and DG decisions correlated significantly with differences in offers between games in regions associated with theory of mind (ToM), such as the temporoparietal junction, and cognitive control, such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and inferior frontal cortex. We conclude that individual differences in prosocial behavior may be driven by variations in the degree to which self-control and ToM processes are engaged during decision-making such that the extent to which these processes are engaged is indicative of either selfish or prosocial motivations.","2019-11","2021-02-11 04:02:17","2021-02-11 04:02:17","","1197-1207","","11","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND Publisher: OXFORD UNIV PRESS Type: Article","","","","","fMRI; machine learning; cognitive control; prosocial behavior; theory of mind","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A useful thought experiment is the application of the Turing test to user-facing artificial intelligence systems in health care. In this paper I argue that many medical decisions require value judgements and the doctor-patient relationship requires empathy and understanding to arrive at a shared decision, often handling large areas of uncertainty and balancing competing risks. Arguably, medicine requires wisdom more than intelligence, artificial or otherwise. Artificial intelligence therefore needs to supplement rather than replace medical professionals, and identifying the complementary positioning of artificial intelligence in medical consultation is a key challenge for the future.

However, only few studies have investigated how functional network changes are related to social anhedonia. The aim of this fMRI study was to classify subjects according to their degree of social anhedonia using supervised machine learning. More specifically, we extracted both spatial and temporal network features during a social cognition task from 70 subjects, and used support vector machines for classification. Since impairment in social cognition is well established in schizophrenia-spectrum disorders, the subjects performed a comic strip task designed to specifically probe theory of mind (ToM) and empathy processing. Features representing both temporal (time series) and network dynamics were extracted using task activation maps, seed region analysis, independent component analysis (ICA), and a newly developed multi-subject archetypal analysis (MSAA), which here aimed to further bridge aspects of both seed region analysis and decomposition by incorporating a spotlight approach.We found significant classification of subjects with elevated levels of social anhedonia when using the times series extracted using MSAA, indicating that temporal dynamics carry important information for classification of social anhedonia. Interestingly, we found that the same time series yielded the highest classification performance in a task classification of the ToM condition. Finally, the spatial network corresponding to that time series included both prefrontal and temporal-parietal regions as well as insula activity, which previously have been related schizotypy and the development of schizophrenia.","2019-12-01","2021-02-11 04:02:18","2021-02-11 04:02:18","","4965-4981","","17","40","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article","","","","","archetypical analysis; decomposition; functional connectivity; social anhedonia; support vector classification","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, it is not known whether real-world altruists' heightened empathy reflects true self-other mapping of multi-voxel neural response patterns. We investigated this relationship in adults who had engaged in extraordinarily costly real-world altruism: donating a kidney to a stranger. Altruists and controls completed fMRI testing while anticipating and experiencing pain, and watching as a stranger anticipated and experienced pain. Machine learning classifiers tested for shared representation between experienced and observed distress. Altruists exhibited more similar representations of experienced and observed fearful anticipation spontaneously and following an empathy prompt in anterior insula and anterior/middle cingulate cortex, respectively, suggesting heightened empathic proclivities and abilities for fear. During pain epochs, altruists were distinguished by spontaneous empathic responses in anterior insula, anterior/mid-cingulate cortex and supplementary motor area, but showed no difference from controls after the empathy prompt. These findings (1) link shared multi-voxel representations of the distress of self and others to real-world costly altruism, (2) reinforce distinctions between empathy for sensory states like pain and anticipatory affective states like fear, and (3) highlight the importance of differentiating between the proclivity and ability to empathize.","2019-07-24","2021-02-11 04:02:18","2021-02-11 04:02:18","","","","","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND Publisher: NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

BACKGROUND: Meaningful recognition positively impacts nursing and organizational outcomes. The use of AI techniques such as natural language processing andmachine learning to identify and describe behaviors impacting patient experiences is an emerging science. METHODS: Nurse recognition comments were collected from a convenience sample of 3 organizations via an IPC inpatient platform and analyzed using the AI techniques of natural language processing, machine learning, sentiment analytics, and corollary dictionaries based on rules of linguistics. RESULTS: The top theme of nursing recognition comments was courtesy and respect with the behaviors of empathy/compassion, helpfulness, kindness, attentiveness, and emotional comfort. The theme of skills/knowledge was the 2nd most common, with the behaviors of being professional, knowledgeable, keeping track, competence, dedication, and being thorough. CONCLUSIONS: AI techniques for qualitative analysis of comments collected through IPC reveal nurse themes and behaviors most meaningful to patients and their family members. Nurses can advance the science of AI and guide its evolution so that nurse caring behaviors associated with establishing human connections that positively influence patient and family experience are accurately represented.","2019-06","2021-02-11 04:02:18","2021-02-11 04:02:18","","303-309","","6","49","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA Publisher: LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At present, this requires experts and training human coding teams, which is slow, expensive, and labor intensive. Machine learning and speech signal processing technologies provide a way to scale up feedback in psychotherapy. We evaluated an initial proof of concept automated feedback system that generates motivational interviewing quality metrics and provides easy access to other session data (e.g.. transcripts). The system automatically provides a report of session-level metrics (e.g., therapist empathy) and therapist behavior codes at the talk-turn level (e.g., reflections). We assessed usability, therapist satisfaction, perceived accuracy, and intentions to adopt. A sample of 21 novice (n = 10) or experienced (n = 11) therapists each completed a 10-min session with a standardized patient. The system received the audio from the session as input and then automatically generated feedback that therapists accessed via a web portal. All participants found the system easy to use and were satisfied with their feedback, 83% found the feedback consistent with their own perceptions of their clinical performance, and 90% reported they were likely to use the feedback in their practice. We discuss the implications of applying new technologies to evaluation of psychotherapy.","2019-06","2021-02-11 04:02:18","2021-02-11 04:02:18","","318-328","","2","56","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 1390 SOUTH DIXIE HIGHWAY, STE 2222, CORAL GABLES, FL 33146-2946 USA Publisher: AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC, DIV PSYCHOTHERAPY Type: Article","","","","","machine learning; feedback; adherence; dissemination; motivational interviewing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the present study, we investigated the relationship between mimicry and cognitive and emotional empathy. To assess mimicry, facial electromyography was recorded for 70 participants while they completed the Multifaceted Empathy Test, which presents complex context-embedded emotional expressions. As predicted, inter-individual differences in emotional and cognitive empathy were associated with the level of facial mimicry. For positive emotions, the intensity of the mimicry response scaled with the level of state emotional empathy. Mimicry was stronger for the emotional empathy task compared to the cognitive empathy task. The specific empathy condition could be successfully detected from facial muscle activity at the level of single individuals using machine learning techniques. These results support the view that mimicry occurs depending on the social context as a tool to affiliate and it is involved in cognitive as well as emotional empathy.","2019-11-17","2021-02-11 04:02:19","2021-02-11 04:02:19","","1672-1686","","8","33","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND Publisher: ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD Type: Article","","","","","empathy; cognitive; complex emotions; emotional; Facial mimicry","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Objective: This study aimed to explore general practitioners' (GPs') opinions about the potential impact of future technology on key tasks in primary care. Methods: In June 2018, we conducted a Web-based survey of 720 UK GPs' opinions about the likelihood of future technology to fully replace GPs in performing 6 key primary care tasks, and, if respondents considered replacement for a particular task likely, to estimate how soon the technological capacity might emerge. This study involved qualitative descriptive analysis of written responses (”comments”) to an open-ended question in the survey. Results: Comments were classified into 3 major categories in relation to primary care: (1) limitations of future technology, (2) potential benefits of future technology, and (3) social and ethical concerns. Perceived limitations included the beliefs that communication and empathy are exclusively human competencies; many GPs also considered clinical reasoning and the ability to provide value-based care as necessitating physicians' judgments. Perceived benefits of technology included expectations about improved efficiencies, in particular with respect to the reduction of administrative burdens on physicians. Social and ethical concerns encompassed multiple, divergent themes including the need to train more doctors to overcome workforce shortfalls and misgivings about the acceptability of future technology to patients. However, some GPs believed that the failure to adopt technological innovations could incur harms to both patients and physicians. Conclusions: This study presents timely information on physicians' views about the scope of artificial intelligence (AI) in primary care. Overwhelmingly, GPs considered the potential of AI to be limited. These views differ from the predictions of biomedical informaticians. More extensive, stand-alone qualitative work would provide a more in-depth understanding of GPs' views.","2019-03-20","2021-02-11 04:02:19","2021-02-11 04:02:19","","","","3","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 59 WINNERS CIRCLE, TORONTO, ON M4L 3Y7, CANADA Publisher: JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC Type: Article","","","","","artificial intelligence; machine learning; attitudes; future; opinions; qualitative research; technology; general practice; primary care","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

If a robot can identify emotions and intentions of a human interacting with it, interactions with humans can potentially become more natural and effective. However, mechanisms of perception and empathy used by humans to achieve this understanding may not be suitable or adequate for use within robots. Electroencephalography (EEG) can be used for recording signals revealing emotions and motivations from a human brain. This study aimed to evaluate different machine learning techniques to classify EEG data associated with specific affective/emotional states. For experimental purposes, we used visual (IAPS) and physical (Tower of Hanoi) tasks to record human emotional states in the form of EEG data. The obtained EEG data processed, formatted and evaluated using various machine learning techniques to find out which method can most accurately classify EEG data according to associated affective/emotional states. The experiment confirms the choice of a method for improving the accuracy of results. According to the results, Support Vector Machine was the first, and Regression Tree was the second best method for classifying EEG data associated with specific affective/emotional states with accuracies up to 70.00% and 60.00%, respectively.

To automatically recognize such instances, we develop a multimodal deep neural network for identifying opportunities when the agent should express positive or negative empathetic responses.

While basic design is focused on the development of new products for the individual, working towards a more sustainable world demands greater attention to designing for and with communities. Improving design education and examining design-learning outcomes requires a kind of targeted approach that could match the best practices to personalize student learning. Design is complex and design includes balancing the needs of multiple stakeholders. However, there is a gap in the preparation of design education that will be needed in a challenging environment. This paper reviews the history of design thinking in the engineering curriculum. Design thinking education starts with an understanding of its importance with socioeconomic relevance. Through observation and empathy, mapping the designer uses the listening and learning tools for mapping users unarticulated needs, working in a team environment. The designer takes time to think carefully why a certain project is considered and details which aspects of machine learning application can be applied from functional to complete success for the end users. The availability of powerful virtual reality methodologies, have made it possible to consider the realistic needs and visualize scenarios and to explore the design alternatives with new ideas before full scale resource allocation on new ideas. Mid-to-advanced level courses with experimental assignments require that students apply through experimentation the principles and concepts learned in foundation courses. The basic design tools such as axiomatic thinking, theory of inventive problem solving, design iteration and simulation using hardware-in-the loop are discussed with case studies. Consideration of product sustainability with the thoughts of design for disassembly and disposal has emerged as a major part of design thinking. Senior engineering courses center on cross and interdisciplinary design and capstone experiences so that students experience fully guided practice of device design and problem solving, simulating what they are likely to experience in the world. This paper examines the critical issues of design thinking in a curriculum from observation, empathy mapping, validation of the idea, and improvement of idea by virtual reality and machine learning, optimization of the idea by tools such as axiomatic design, hardware in the loop simulation, and finally examining product sustainability causes.","2019","2021-02-11 04:02:21","2021-02-11 04:02:21","","","","","","","","","","","","","AMER SOC MECHANICAL ENGINEERS","THREE PARK AVENUE, NEW YORK, NY 10016-5990 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: Amer Soc Mech Engineers Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>ASMEInternational Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition (IMECE2018), Pittsburgh, PA, NOV 09-15, 2018</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Moreover, the latter are not “innocent” or neutral, but predispose their users to specific kinds of experiences, as well as to the widespread belief that society can be technically controlled A brief discussion is devoted to Gil Germain's contention, that in the current technologically oriented dispensation humans have forgotten what it means to be “desiring” beings, and that the social ideal of technological control has reduced human “desire” - the character of being “open” to the world - to mere, technically satisfiable “need”. Under such circumstances technology mediates human experience of the world The very fact that the American president can (and does), frequently cause an uproar in American society and beyond by means of timely and untimely “tweets” - that is, by using the social internet site, Twitter - is symptomatic of this state of affairs, as well as of the fact that we live in the era of what Manuel Castells calls the “network society”. According to Castells this novel societal configuration has been made possible by the technological revolution stretching back to the invention of the radio, which led to the advent of television and multi-media, and culminated in the development of the internet. Significantly, this global technological revolution has fundamentally altered the experience of time and space, with the consequence that the traditional experience of space as “place”, and time as sequential, has made way for the newly dominant modes of spatial and temporal experience, namely as “the space of flows” and “timeless time”. The reconstruction of Castells `s conception of the structural dynamics of contemporary, society in broad terms, as fundamentally technologically generated, sets the scene for the more specifically focused discussion that follows, beginning with Sherry Turkle's analysis of the effects of technology on human behaviour. What Turkle's recent work brings to light is that, although many people aspire to the status of (what is known as) “digital natives”, this does not come without a significant cost, namely a certain deterioration in affective and intellectual functioning. Despite her initial optimism about the gains of electronic technology, particularly the internet, in the social domain, her more recent work has therefore shifted to a distinctly critical approach to the relationship between people (particularly children) and technology. Not only has the use of smartphones and electronic tablets given rise to the phenomenon of being “alone together” with one's device, and concomitantly, to keeping people at arm's length in social reality (with to-be-expected negative consequences for one k ability and willingness to negotiate complex human relationships), but the attachment of particularly young children to their smartphones has had the demonstrable effect of eroding their capacity for empathy with others, as well as more generally their ability to communicate with their peers in concrete social space. Furthermore, “ doing things” on the internet has given people the wrong impression regarding the overcoming of political problems, which often require concrete social interaction and painstaking negotiation - something that people sometimes learn anew with a shock, when their “internet activism” comes to nothing. Another critical theorist concerning technology, Bernard Stiegler, radicalises Turkle k thinking by offering a critique of technology as being, on the one hand, a source of enslavement and of the “stupidification” of people, while simultaneously being a means of “critical intenstfication”. In this respect, he argues, technology is a pharmakon - poison and cure at the same time. This means that technical devices such as smartphones inculcate an over-dependence on them in users, simultaneously - as external memory-machines - robbing them of their capacity for memory and thinking. After all, the ability to manipulate a technical device cannot be equated with critical thinking, nor can the storing of information on a smartphone or a computer be regarded as being synonymous with exercising ones own memory. On the other hand, however, Stiegler recognises the capacity of technical devices to give one access to archives of information, as well as to technically mediated experiences of the world that was not previously possible, and urges users to use technology for critical intellectual purposes, instead of being only at the receiving end of information regarding marketing and purchasing opportunities, disseminated via technical devices by capitalist agencies. He draws attention to the fact that schools have become the veritable battlegrounds where these agencies vie with teachers for the attention of students, in the process interfering with the development of their critical intellectual ability for the sake of capturing their attention for purposes of marketing. The paper concludes with a brief elaboration on some ways in which Stiegler's and Turkle's dire diagnoses may be countered with practices that give reason for hope.","2018-12","2021-02-11 04:02:21","2021-02-11 04:02:21","","634-649","","4, 1","58","","","","","","","","","","Afrikaans","","","","","","","Place: P.

Major depression is associated with impaired psychosocial functioning and reduced quality of life. Challenges such as shortage of mental health personnel, long waiting times, perceived stigma, and lower government spends pose barriers to the alleviation of mental health problems. Face-to-face psychotherapy alone provides only point-in-time support and cannot scale quickly enough to address this growing global public health challenge. Artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled, empathetic, and evidence-driven conversational mobile app technologies could play an active role in filling this gap by increasing adoption and enabling reach. Although such a technology can help manage these barriers, they should never replace time with a health care professional for more severe mental health problems. However, app technologies could act as a supplementary or intermediate support system. Mobile mental well-being apps need to uphold privacy and foster both short- and long-term positive outcomes. Objective: This study aimed to present a preliminary real-world data evaluation of the effectiveness and engagement levels of an AI-enabled, empathetic, text-based conversational mobile mental well-being app, Wysa, on users with self-reported symptoms of depression. Methods: In the study, a group of anonymous global users were observed who voluntarily installed the Wysa app, engaged in text-based messaging, and self-reported symptoms of depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. On the basis of the extent of app usage on and between 2 consecutive screening time points, 2 distinct groups of users (high users and low users) emerged. The study used mixed-methods approach to evaluate the impact and engagement levels among these users. The quantitative analysis measured the app impact by comparing the average improvement in symptoms of depression between high and low users. The qualitative analysis measured the app engagement and experience by analyzing in-app user feedback and evaluated the performance of a machine learning classifier to detect user objections during conversations. Results: The average mood improvement (ie, difference in pre- and post-self-reported depression scores) between the groups (ie, high vs low users; n=108 and n=21, respectively) revealed that the high users group had significantly higher average improvement (mean 5.84 [SD 6.66]) compared with the low users group (mean 3.52 [SD 6.15]); Mann-Whitney P=.03 and with a moderate effect size of 0.63. Moreover, 67.7% of user-provided feedback responses found the app experience helpful and encouraging. Conclusions: The real-world data evaluation findings on the effectiveness and engagement levels of Wysa app on users with self-reported symptoms of depression show promise. However, further work is required to validate these initial findings in much larger samples and across longer periods.","2018-11","2021-02-11 04:02:22","2021-02-11 04:02:22","","","","11","6","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 59 WINNERS CIRCLE, TORONTO, ON M4L 3Y7, CANADA Publisher: JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC Type: Article","","","","","resilience; artificial intelligence; emotions; depression; empathy; conversational agents; mental health; chatbots; coping skills; mHealth; psychological","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite a surge of interest in examining behavioral characteristics of narcissism in the past decades, the neurobiological substrates underlying narcissism remain poorly understood. Here, we addressed this issue by applying a machine learning approach to decode trait narcissism from whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC). Resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) data were acquired for a large sample comprising 155 healthy adults, each of whom was assessed for trait narcissism. Using a linear prediction model, we examined the relationship between whole-brain RSFC and trait narcissism. We demonstrated that the machine-learning model was able to decode individual trait narcissism from RSFC across multiple neural systems, including functional connectivity between and within limbic and prefrontal systems as well as their connectivity with other networks. Key nodes that contributed to the prediction model included the amygdala, prefrontal and anterior cingulate regions that have been linked to trait narcissism. These findings remained robust using different validation procedures. Our findings thus demonstrate that RSFC among multiple neural systems predicts trait narcissism at the individual level.","2018-09","2021-02-11 04:02:22","2021-02-11 04:02:22","","3701-3712","","9","39","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article","","","","","connectome-based predictive modeling; cross validation; narcissism; resting-state functional connectivity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Importantly, this neural mirroring is not constant; rather, it is modulated by our beliefs about their intentions, circumstances, and group allegiances. We investigated if the neural empathic response is modulated by minimally-differentiating information (e.g., a simple text label indicating another's religious belief), and if neural activity changes predict ingroups and outgroups across independent paradigms. We found that the empathic response was larger when participants viewed a painful event occurring to a hand labeled with their own religion (ingroup) than to a hand labeled with a different religion (outgroup). Counterintuitively, the magnitude of this bias correlated positively with the magnitude of participants' self-reported empathy. A multivariate classifier, using mean activity in empathy-related brain regions as features, discriminated ingroup from outgroup with 72% accuracy; the classifier's confidence correlated with belief certainty. This classifier generalized successfully to validation experiments in which the ingroup condition was based on an arbitrary group assignment. Empathy networks thus allow for the classification of long-held, newly-modified and arbitrarily-formed ingroups and outgroups. This is the first report of a single machine learning model on neural activation that generalizes to multiple representations of ingroup and outgroup. The current findings may prove useful as an objective diagnostic tool to measure the magnitude of one's group affiliations, and the effectiveness of interventions to reduce ingroup biases.","2018-07-31","2021-02-11 04:02:22","2021-02-11 04:02:22","","","","","12","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND Publisher: FRONTIERS MEDIA SA Type: Article","","","","","machine learning; social neuroscience; pain; empathy; affect; ingroup; mind reading; religion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This device provided information regarding an older adult's foot pressure pattern to the person (trainee) and coach (trainer) to refine the interpersonal feedback. In this project, a feasibility laboratory study was first conducted to clarify the validity of the BF system (i.e., kinematic changes and cognitive burden of the device). Our preliminary study showed that the system had potential to modify the kinematic pattern in some older adults, but not walking speed (comprehensive evaluation of walking). Moreover, it is likely that the device required, to some extent, a cognitive burden for specific older people; thus, this aspect may have interfered with the usability of the BF in the initial practice phase. These results provided essential preliminary knowledge for designing a successful BF system and future trial with BF devices.","2018","2021-02-11 04:02:23","2021-02-11 04:02:23","","1530-1534","","","","","","","IEEE International Conference on Systems Man and Cybernetics Conference Proceedings","","","","IEEE","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: IEEE; Sci Council Japan ISSN: 1062-922X Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC), IEEE Syst Man &amp; Cybernet Soc, Miyazaki, JAPAN, OCT 07-10, 2018</p>","","","","motor learning; biofeedback; gait; human-machine interface; interpersonal feedback; older","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The used methodology integrated methods from data science and psychology, and it was based on a machine learning approach combined with a psycho-lexical analysis of online discussions. Results showed that from the words used by social media commenters can be extracted peculiar psychological processes behind supportive and unsupportive stance toward immigrant hosting. In particular, words were qualitatively grouped by defining the underlying value dimension, cognitive, emotional and also attributional processes for both supportive and unsupportive commenters.

Risk models of recidivism often combine chronological age with demographic, social and psychological features to aid in judicial decision-making. Here we use independent component analyses (ICA) and machine learning techniques to demonstrate the utility of using brain-based measures of cerebral aging to predict recidivism. First, we developed a brain-age model that predicts chronological age based on structural MRI data from incarcerated males (n = 1332). We then test the model's ability to predict recidivism in a new sample of offenders with longitudinal outcome data (n = 93). Consistent with hypotheses, inclusion of brain-age measures of the inferior frontal cortex and anterior-medial temporal lobes (i.e., amygdala) improved prediction models when compared with models using chronological age; and models that combined psychological, behavioral, and neuroimaging measures provided the most robust prediction of recidivism. These results verify the utility of brain measures in predicting future behavior, and suggest that brain-based data may more precisely account for important variation when compared with traditional proxy measures such as chronological age. This work also identifies new brain systems that contribute to recidivism which has clinical implications for treatment development.","2018","2021-02-11 04:02:23","2021-02-11 04:02:23","","813-823","","","19","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND Publisher: ELSEVIER SCI LTD Type: Article","","","","","Age; Antisocial; MRI; Neuroprediction; Recidivism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, we could not provide feedback to cyberspace regarding the place, time, and target of a user realizing friendship since there is no technique for conveniently measuring the evocation of friendship during offline events. In this research, we propose a method of estimating the evocation of friendship using the similarity in the pulse rate variabilities (PRVs) of users when empathy is evoked between them. The user can be made aware of friendship estimated automatically through machine learning by wearing a wristwatch-type pulsimeter. CFs are more likely to evoke empathy than superficial friendships (SFs). To demonstrate the usefulness of this method, we conducted an experiment assuming an event where a group of four people are enjoying their time in an amusement park. From the experimental results, we showed that the similarity of the PRVs in CFs is greater than that in SFs when the favorability rating is high and the users like each other. Moreover, we showed that the proposed method estimated the evocation of friendship during the attraction experience with anf-measure of 0.74 at maximum and during an offline event with a mean f-measure of 0.78. The results showed the usefulness and effectiveness of this method.","2018","2021-02-11 04:02:24","2021-02-11 04:02:24","","1407-1426","","7","30","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 1-23-3-303 SENDAGI, TOKYO, 113-0022, JAPAN Publisher: MYU, SCIENTIFIC PUBLISHING DIVISION Type: Article","","","","","machine learning; friendship; favorability; similarity of pulse rate variability of users","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As people interact more often with voice and gesture controlled machines, they expect the machines to recognize different emotions, and understand other high level communication features such as humor, sarcasm and intention. In order to make such communication possible, the machines need an empathy module in them, which is a software system that can extract emotions from human speech and behavior and can decide the correct response of the robot. Although research on empathetic robots is still in the primary stage, current methods involve using signal processing techniques, sentiment analysis and machine learning algorithms to make robots that can `understand' human emotion. Other aspects of human-robot interaction include facial expression and gesture recognition, as well as robot movement to convey emotion and intent. We propose Zara the Supergirl as a prototype system of empathetic robots. It is a software-based virtual android, with an animated cartoon character to present itself on the screen. She will get `smarter' and more empathetic, by having machine learning algorithms, and gathering more data and learning from it. In this paper, we present our work so far in the areas of deep learning of emotion and sentiment recognition, as well as humor recognition.

The purpose of this study is to compare two models describing social-emotional behavior, one of which is based on a traditional machine learning algorithm, and the other on a cognitive architecture supporting social emotionality. It is hypothesized that the second model will be more efficient in eliciting user's empathy to a virtual cobot based on this model. Here the object of study is a virtual pet: a penguin. Two models controlling the pet were compared: a reinforcement learning model (a Q-learning algorithm) and the emotional cognitive architecture eBICA (Samsonovich, 2013). The second approach was based on a semantic map of pet's emotional states, that was constructed based on the human ranking. It is found that the eBICA model scores higher in participant's empathy compared to the model based on reinforcement learning. This article compares strengths and weaknesses of both methods. In conclusion, the findings indicate advantages of the approach based on eBICA compared to more traditional techniques. Results will have broad implications for building intelligent social agents.

Here, we examined whether the connectivity patterns of functional systems affected in schizophrenia (SCZ), Parkinson's disease (PD), or normal aging equally translate into high classification accuracies for these conditions. We compared classification performance between pre-defined networks for each group and, for any given network, between groups. Separate support vector machine classifications of 86 SCZ patients, 80 PD patients, and 95 older adults relative to their matched healthy/young controls, respectively, were performed on functional connectivity in 12 task-based, meta-analytically defined networks using 25 replications of a nested 10-fold cross-validation scheme. Classification performance of the various networks clearly differed between conditions, as those networks that best classified one disease were usually non-informative for the other. For SCZ, but not PD, emotion-processing, empathy, and cognitive action control networks distinguished patients most accurately from controls. For PD, but not SCZ, networks subserving autobiographical or semantic memory, motor execution, and theory-of-mind cognition yielded the best classifications. In contrast, young-old classification was excellent based on all networks and outperformed both clinical classifications. Our pattern-classification approach captured associations between clinical and developmental conditions and functional network integrity with a higher level of specificity than did previous whole-brain analyses. Taken together, our results support resting-state connectivity as a marker of functional dysregulation in specific networks known to be affected by SCZ and PD, while suggesting that aging affects network integrity in a more global way.

We compared self-report ratings of the multidimensional scale of PSS (MSPSS) among age-and IQ-matched groups of adults (18-58 years) with cognitively high-functioning ASD (N=41), or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; N=69), and neurotypical controls (NC; N=69). Accompanying group comparisons, we used machine learning random forest (RF) analyses to explore predictors among a range of psychopathological and socio-emotional variables. Relative to both ADHD and NC, adults with ASD showed lower MSPSS ratings, specifically for the friends subscale (MSPSS-f). Across ASD and ADHD, interindividual differences in autism severity, affective empathy, symptoms of anxiety related to social interactions, hyperactivity/impulsivity, and somatization best predicted MSPSS-f. These relationships did not differ between clinical groups. While group comparisons demonstrated greater impairment in individuals with ASD, analyzing individuals' characteristics revealed cross-diagnoses similarities in regard to their MSPSS-f relationships.

However, these computer-delivered interventions rely on mouse, keyboard, or touchscreen responses for interactions between the users and the computer-delivered intervention. The principles of motivational interviewing suggest that in-person interventions may be effective, in part, because they encourage individuals to think through and speak aloud their motivations for changing a health behavior, which current computer-delivered interventions do not allow. Objective: The objective of this study was to take the initial steps toward development of a voice-based computer-delivered intervention that can ask open-ended questions and respond appropriately to users' verbal responses, more closely mirroring a human-delivered motivational intervention. Methods: We developed (1) a voice-based computer-delivered intervention that was run by a human controller and that allowed participants to speak their responses to scripted prompts delivered by speech generation software and (2) a text-based computer-delivered intervention that relied on the mouse, keyboard, and computer screen for all interactions. We randomized 60 heavy drinking college students to interact with the voice-based computer-delivered intervention and 30 to interact with the text-based computer-delivered intervention and compared their ratings of the systems as well as their motivation to change drinking and their drinking behavior at 1-month follow-up. Results: Participants reported that the voice-based computer-delivered intervention engaged positively with them in the session and delivered content in a manner consistent with motivational interviewing principles. At 1-month follow-up, participants in the voice-based computer-delivered intervention condition reported significant decreases in quantity, frequency, and problems associated with drinking, and increased perceived importance of changing drinking behaviors. In comparison to the text-based computer-delivered intervention condition, those assigned to voice-based computer-delivered intervention reported significantly fewer alcohol-related problems at the 1-month follow-up (incident rate ratio 0.60, 95% CI 0.44-0.83, P=.002). The conditions did not differ significantly on perceived importance of changing drinking or on measures of drinking quantity and frequency of heavy drinking. Conclusions: Results indicate that it is feasible to construct a series of open-ended questions and a bank of responses and follow-up prompts that can be used in a future fully automated voice-based computer-delivered intervention that may mirror more closely human-delivered motivational interventions to reduce drinking.

If such questions that are asked for the purpose of receiving empathy can get responses, it serves as an important factor to increase satisfaction of users.

This new revolution brings new paradigms that is breaking the way men work, and, consequently, changes in their training will also be necessary due to differences in knowledge and skills needed to meet new job demands. A fundamental characteristic of this new mode of production is multidisciplinary teams with a high level of technical knowledge and the ability to face several aspects of the production system, from production line up to customer interaction and integration with business and corporative systems. Besides, due to the velocity of transformations, the new employees must be able to learn and change quickly. Furthermore, such workers must develop intrinsically human characteristics like empathy, personal relationship and technical skills that machines won't be able to do, since all other activities would be done by machines with artificial intelligence and advanced robotics. This paper proposes the use of pedagogical robotics in order to develop multidisciplinary ability and development of interpersonal relationships, creativity and critical thinking to the future employees. It is discussed active learning methodology and the features of educational robotics that could be applied in order to develop the abilities to attend these new job demands.","2017","2021-02-11 04:02:26","2021-02-11 04:02:26","","2283-2285","","","","","","","EDULEARN Proceedings","","","","IATED-INT ASSOC TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION & DEVELOPMENT","LAURI VOLPI 6, VALENICA, BURJASSOT 46100, SPAIN","English","","","","","","","ISSN: 2340-1117 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>9th International Conference on Education and New Learning Technologies (EDULEARN), Barcelona, SPAIN, JUL 03-05, 2017</p>","","","","active learning; Industry 4.0; pedagogical robotics","Chova, LG and Martinez, AL and Torres, IC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, as a first step to answering this big question, we present a design method for telepathic products applied to the case study of a kitchen faucet. The case study is used to illustrate the different steps of the design method: (A) Build cognitive empathy and define cognitive styles; (B) Define design requirements, articulate variables that will control performance, understand limitations and design physical product; (C) Design the machine learning algorithm, inputs, and outputs; and (D) Integration and refinement. This work-in-progress report highlights the intricacies of applying adaptive machine-learning behavior to physical products performance in the “real world” rather than to a website or device such as a smart phone. Interesting findings include that automatic response, typically associated with websites and phones, is not possible with plumbing as water cannot be instantly at the right temperature; and that cognitive styles indeed manifest in dish washing observations, with distinctly different styles in terms of patience, temperature sensitivity, and laziness.","2017","2021-02-11 04:02:26","2021-02-11 04:02:26","","169-178","","","","","","","International Conference on Engineering Design","","","","DESIGN SOC","109 DUNDEE DRIVE, GLASGOW, G52 3HL, SCOTLAND","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: Univ British Columbia, Dept Mech Engn; Design Soc; Univ British Columbia; Tech Univ Denmark; McGill Univ; Clemson Univ; Ryerson Univ; Univ Studiorum Zagrabiensis ISSN: 2220-4334 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>21st International Conference on Engineering Design (ICED), Vancouver, CANADA, AUG 21-25, 2017</p>","","","","Case study; Design methods; Ecodesign; Human behaviour in design; User centred design","Maier, A and Skec, S and Kim, H and Kokkolaras, M and Oehmen, J and Fadel, G and Salustri, F and VanDerLoos, M","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This research attempts to model specific forms of intelligence through brute-force search heuristics and also reproduce features of human perception and cognition, including emotions. Such goals have implications for artificial consciousness, with some arguing that it will be achievable once we overcome short-term engineering challenges. We believe, however, that phenomenal consciousness cannot be implemented in machines. This becomes clear when considering emotions and examining the dissociation between consciousness and attention in humans. While we may be able to program ethical behavior based on rules and machine learning, we will never be able to reproduce emotions or empathy by programming such control systems these will be merely simulations. Arguments in favor of this claim include considerations about evolution, the neuropsychological aspects of emotions, and the dissociation between attention and consciousness found in humans. Ultimately, we are far from achieving artificial consciousness. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Currently, there are many devices that allow gathering biometric measurements from human beings, such as EEG Headsets or Health Bracelets. The massive data sets generated by tracking of EEG and physiology may be used, among other things, to infer knowledge about human moods and emotions. Apart from direct biometric signal measurement, eye tracking systems are nowadays capable of determining the point of gaze of the users when interacting in ICT environments, which provides an added value research on many different areas, such as psychology or marketing. We present a process in which devices for eye tracking, biometric, and EEG signal measurements are synchronously used for studying both basic and complex emotions. We selected the least intrusive devices for different signal data collection given the study requirements and cost constraints, so users would behave in the most natural way possible. On the one hand, we have been able to determine basic emotions participants were experiencing by means of valence and arousal. On the other hand, a complex emotion such as empathy has also been detected. To validate the usefulness of this approach, a study involving forty-four people has been carried out, where they were exposed to a series of affective stimuli while their EEG activity, biometric signals, and eye position were synchronously recorded to detect self-regulation. The hypothesis of the work was that people who self-regulated would show significantly different results when analyzing their EEG data. Participants were divided into two groups depending on whether Electro Dermal Activity (EDA) data indicated they self-regulated or not. The comparison of the results obtained using different machine learning algorithms for emotion recognition shows that using EEG activity alone as a predictor for self-regulation does not allow properly determining whether a person in self-regulation its emotions while watching affective stimuli. However, adequately combining different data sources in a synchronous way to detect emotions makes it possible to overcome the limitations of single detection methods.","2016-08-19","2021-02-11 04:02:27","2021-02-11 04:02:27","","","","","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND Publisher: FRONTIERS MEDIA SA Type: Article","","","","","EEG; emotions; empathy; biometric information; eye tracking","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There is an ongoing effort to find a HIP that is secure enough yet easy for humans. Recently, a new HIP has been designed aiming at higher security: the Civil Rights Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart (CAPTCHA). It employs the empathy capacity of humans to further strengthen Securimage, a well-known text CAPTCHA. In this paper, we analyze it from a security perspective, finding fundamental design flaws. Using several well-known machine learning (ML) algorithms, we analyze to what extent these flaws affect its security. We discover that thanks to them, we can create a successful side-channel attack. This attack is able to correctly solve the HIP on 20.7% of occasions, much more than enough to consider it broken. Thus, we show that there is no need to solve the problem of optical character recognition nor empathy analysis for computers to break this particular HIP. ML can be successfully used to break a HIP that uses both with a side-channel attack. This security analysis can be applied to other HIPs. It will allow to test whether they are leaking too much information by unexpected ways, given non-evident design flaws.

This course is as much about design thinking and learning as it is about design innovation, creativity and doing design. The design of an artifact is addressed from a multidisciplinary perspective that includes determination through inspiration, ideation, and implementation using a design thinking framework. Student submissions were categorized based on (1) design methods such as concept generation, product definition, prototyping and design verification, and (2) student demographic information. The application of the design methods on the project influenced the further development of class-based exercises that infuse empathy into design. The study presented here also provides a framework for engaging distance-learning students within hands-on empathic-design exercises. The results show that techniques such as interviews of focus groups and immersive practices help students to better understand user needs in developing world contexts, leading to more feasible design solutions.

Leadership is considered pivotal for enabling the development and preservation of compassionate health care organizations. Strategies for developing compassionate health care leadership in the complex, fast-moving world of today will require a paradigm shift from the prevalent dehumanizing model of the organization as machine to one of the organizations as a living complex adaptive system. It will also require the abandonment of individualistic, heroic models of leadership to one of shared, distributive, and adaptive leadership. “Command and control” leadership, accompanied by stifling regulation, rigid prescriptions, coercive punishments, and/or extrinsic rewards, infuses fear into the system with consequent disempowerment and disunity within the workforce, and the attrition of innovation and compassion. It must be eschewed. Instead, leadership should be developed throughout the organization with collective holistic learning strategies combined with high levels of staff support and engagement. Culture and leadership are interdependent and synergistic; their codevelopment needs to be grounded in a sophisticated, scientifically based account of human nature held within a coherent philosophical framework reflected by modern organizational and leadership theories. Developing leadership for compassionate care requires acknowledging and making provision for the difficulties and challenges of working in an anxiety-laden context. This means providing appropriate training and well-being programs, sustaining high levels of trust and mutually supportive interpersonal connections, and fostering the sharing of knowledge, skills, and workload across silos. It requires enabling people to experiment without fear of reprisal, to reflect on their work, and to view errors as opportunities for learning and improvement. Tasks and relational care need to be integrated into a coherent unity, creating space for real dialog between patients, clinicians, and managers, so that together they can cocreate ways to flourish in the context of illness and dying.","2016","2021-02-11 04:02:28","2021-02-11 04:02:28","","1-10","","","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: PO BOX 300-008, ALBANY, AUCKLAND 0752, NEW ZEALAND Publisher: DOVE MEDICAL PRESS LTD Type: Review","","","","","resilience; culture; compassion; adaptive; complexity; servant leadership","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite several studies on when to backchannel, most of the current spoken dialogue systems generate the same pattern of backchannels, giving monotonous impressions to users. In this work, we investigate generation of a variety of backchannel forms according to the dialogue context. We first show the feasibility of choosing appropriate backchannel forms based on machine learning, and the synergy of using linguistic and prosodic features. For generation of backchannels, a framework based on a set of binary classifiers is adopted to effectively make a “not-to-generate” decision. The proposed model achieved better prediction accuracy than a baseline which always outputs the same backchannel form and another baseline which randomly generates backchannels. Finally, evaluations by human subjects demonstrate that the proposed method generates backchannels as naturally as human choices, giving impressions of understanding and empathy.","2016","2021-02-11 04:02:29","2021-02-11 04:02:29","","2890-2894","","","","","","","Interspeech","","","","ISCA-INT SPEECH COMMUNICATION ASSOC","C/O EMMANUELLE FOXONET, 4 RUE DES FAUVETTES, LIEU DIT LOUS TOURILS, BAIXAS, F-66390, FRANCE","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: apple; amazon alexa; Google; Microsoft; ebay; facebook; YAHOO JAPAN; Baidu Res; IBM Res; CIRRUS LOGIC; DATATANG; NUANCE; Speechocean Ltd; Yandex; Raytheon Technol ISSN: 2308-457X Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>17th Annual Conference of the International-Speech-Communication-Association (INTERSPEECH 2016), San Francisco, CA, SEP 08-12, 2016</p>","","","","spoken dialogue systems; attentive listening; backchannel","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Evidence from psychology, biology and economics suggests that prosocial behaviors can be driven by a variety of seemingly opposing factors: altruism or egoism, intuition or deliberation, inborn instincts or learned dispositions, and utility derived from actions or their outcomes. Here we propose a framework inspired by research on reinforcement learning and decision making that links these processes and explains characteristics of prosocial behaviors in different contexts. More specifically, we suggest that prosocial behaviors inherit features of up to three decision-making systems employed to choose between self- and other-regarding acts: a goal directed system that selects actions based on their predicted consequences, a habitual system that selects actions based on their reinforcement history, and a Pavlovian system that emits reflexive responses based on evolutionarily prescribed priors. This framework, initially described in the field of cognitive neuroscience and machine learning, provides insight into the potential neural circuits and computations shaping prosocial behaviors. Furthermore, it identifies specific conditions in which each of these three systems should dominate and promote other- or self- regarding behavior.","2015-05-27","2021-02-11 04:02:30","2021-02-11 04:02:30","","","","","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND Publisher: FRONTIERS MEDIA SA Type: Article","","","","","prosocial behavior; altruism; reinforcement learning; dictator game; model-based; model-free; Pavlovian; warm-glow","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our performative body-mapping (PBM) approach, in contrast, embraces the difference of machinic embodiment and places movement and its connection-making, knowledge-generating potential at the center of our social encounters. The paper discusses the first stage of the project, in which we collaborated with dancers to study how movement propels the becoming-body of a robot, and outlines our embodied approach to machine learning, grounded in the robot's performative capacity.","2015","2021-02-11 04:02:31","2021-02-11 04:02:31","","","","","","","","","","","","","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA","English","","","","","","","Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>4th International Conference on Movement and Computing (MOCO), Univ London, London, ENGLAND, 2017</p>","","","","machine learning; social robotics; Dance; kinesthetic empathy; movement; non-anthropomorphic robots","Niehaus, K","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Speech as an Index of Psychoactive Drug Effects","NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY","","0893-133X","10.1038/npp.2014.80","","Abused drugs can profoundly alter mental states in ways that may motivate drug use. These effects are usually assessed with self-report, an approach that is vulnerable to biases. Analyzing speech during intoxication may present a more direct, objective measure, offering a unique `window' into the mind. Here, we employed computational analyses of speech semantic and topological structure after +/- 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; `ecstasy') and methamphetamine in 13 ecstasy users. In 4 sessions, participants completed a 10-min speech task after MDMA (0.75 and 1.5 mg/kg), methamphetamine (20 mg), or placebo. Latent Semantic Analyses identified the semantic proximity between speech content and concepts relevant to drug effects. Graph-based analyses identified topological speech characteristics. Group-level drug effects on semantic distances and topology were assessed. Machine-learning analyses (with leave-one-out cross-validation) assessed whether speech characteristics could predict drug condition in the individual subject. Speech after MDMA (1.5 mg/kg) had greater semantic proximity than placebo to the concepts friend, support, intimacy, and rapport. Speech on MDMA (0.75 mg/kg) had greater proximity to empathy than placebo. Conversely, speech on methamphetamine was further from compassion than placebo. Classifiers discriminated between MDMA (1.5 mg/kg) and placebo with 88% accuracy, and MDMA (1.5 mg/kg) and methamphetamine with 84% accuracy. For the two MDMA doses, the classifier performed at chance. These data suggest that automated semantic speech analyses can capture subtle alterations in mental state, accurately discriminating between drugs. The findings also illustrate the potential for automated speech-based approaches to characterize clinically relevant alterations to mental state, including those occurring in psychiatric illness.","2014-09","2021-02-11 04:02:31","2021-02-11 04:02:31","","2340-2348","","10","39","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND Publisher: NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Called felicific calculus, this system would judge an action to be morally right or wrong based on several factors like the amount of pleasure it would provide and how much pain the action would inflict upon others. Because of its basis as a type of “moral mathematics” felicific calculus may be a viable candidate as a working ethical system for artificial intelligent agents. This paper examines the concepts of felicific calculus and Utilitarianism in the light of their possible application to artificial intelligence, and proposes methods for its adoption in an actual intelligent machine. In order to facilitate the calculations necessary for this moral system, novel approaches to synthetic pain, pleasure, and empathy are also proposed.","2014","2021-02-11 04:02:32","2021-02-11 04:02:32","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: IEEE Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>IEEE International Symposium on Ethics in Science, Technology and Engineering, Chicago, IL, MAY 23-24, 2014</p>","","","","Concept Learning; Intelligent Agents; Machine Learning; Perceptual Reasoning; Philosophical Foundations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive, inexpensive and useful tool for investigating the neurobiology of schizophrenia and its subtypes. EEG studies elucidate the neurophysiological mechanisms potentially underlying clinical symptomatology. In this review article recent advances in applying EEG to study pathophysiology, phenomenology, and treatment response in schizophrenia are discussed. Investigative strategies employed include: analyzing quantitative EEG (QEEG) spectral power during the resting state and cognitive tasks; applying machine learning methods to identify QEEG indicators of diagnosis and treatment response; and using the event-related brain potential (ERP) technique to characterize the neurocognitive processes underlying clinical symptoms. Studies attempting to validate potential EEG biomarkers of schizophrenia and its symptoms, which could be useful in assessing familial risk and treatment response, are also reviewed.","2013-09","2021-02-11 04:02:32","2021-02-11 04:02:32","","","","9","15","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Review","","","","","Electrophysiology; Language; Electroencephalography; Machine learning; Cognition; Psychosis; Schizophrenia; Working memory; Empathy; Biomarkers; Clozapine; Delusions; Disorganized speech; Endophenotypes; Error monitoring; Event-related potentials; QEEG; Resting state; Symptoms; Thought disorder; Treatment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In social neuroscience, many experiments have sought to first define and then locate `perspective taking', `empathy', and other psychological concepts to specific brain circuits. Seldom, bottom-up studies were conducted to first identify explanatory patterns of brain variation, which are then related to psychological concepts; perhaps due to a lack of large population datasets. In this spirit, we performed a systematic de-construction of social brain morphology into its elementary building blocks, involving similar to 10,000 UK Biobank participants. We explored coherent representations of structural co-variation at population scale within a recent social brain atlas, by translating autoencoder neural networks from deep learning. The learned subnetworks revealed essential patterns of structural relationships between social brain regions, with the nucleus accumbens, medial prefrontal cortex, and temporoparietal junction embedded at the core. Some of the uncovered subnetworks contributed to predicting examined social traits in general, while other subnetworks helped predict specific facets of social functioning, such as the experience of social isolation. As a consequence of our population-level evidence, spatially overlapping subsystems of the social brain probably relate to interindividual differences in everyday social life. Kiesow et al. use deep learning to identify partially overlapping subnetworks in the human social brain at the population level. They also demonstrate that the learned subnetwork representations can be used to predict social traits.","2021-01-14","2021-02-11 04:12:03","2021-02-11 04:12:03","","","","1","4","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY Publisher: NATURE RESEARCH Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To date, the SP/SR framework research has generally focused on entire programmes and has rarely assessed the utility of specific exercises as teaching tools. This study aimed to determine the utility of an exposure intervention known as a shame attack in helping to facilitate CBT training in a clinical psychology programe when delivered in a SP/SR framework. It also sought to examine the potential for the exercise to be used as a form of competency-based assessment. Forty-one student trainees engaged in self-directed shame attack exercises and provided written reflections on their experiences. The reflections were then studied via thematic analysis. The results indicate that the exercise provides an avenue for competency-based assessment of trainee therapists' conceptual knowledge, formulation skills and intervention planning. It also promoted learning outcomes relating to a `deeper' and more nuanced appreciation of CBT theory and practice. The shame attack exercise provided for personal development and the opportunity to experience typical client challenges with engaging in exposure interventions, which have the potential for enhancing empathy and cognitive behavioural skills. Key learning aims To understand the usefulness of a shame attack exercise for training within a SP/SR framework. To examine the potential for using SP/SR as a form of competency-based training.

Intensive critical care nurses who nurse accidentally intoxicated patients face complex and demanding situations, and there is a lack of studies regarding this topic. Aims and objectives To illuminate Swedish intensive critical care nurses' experiences of nursing accidentally intoxicated patients after abuse of illicit drugs. Design A qualitative design with an inductive approach was used. Methods Semi-structured interviews were conducted with eight intensive critical care nurses at an intensive care unit in Sweden. Data were analysed using qualitative content analysis. Findings The themes found illuminate intensive critical care nurses' experiences of nursing accidentally intoxicated patients after their abuse of illicit drugs: feeling empathy and a wish to provide dignified care; dreading nursing the patient and feeling a lack of empathy; feeling frustration and questioning the care; lacking knowledge about a complex and challenging situation. Conclusions It is essential to respond to intoxicated patients with empathy and dignity. Intensive critical care nurses should learn how to identify factors that lead to provocation and agitation in order to reduce the occurrence of dangerous situations in intensive care units. Relevance to clinical practice To create a caring environment where the interaction becomes more positive and harmonious, an intensive care nurse needs a deep understanding of what a drug abuse disorder means. Moreover, the ability to see the person behind the abuse and to provide non-judgemental support is required. WHAT IS KNOWN ABOUT THIS TOPICWHAT THIS PAPER CONTRIBUTES Patients intoxicated after abuse of illicit drugs constitute a significant proportion of patients cared for in ICUs worldwide. Intensive critical nurses who nurse accidentally intoxicated patients face complex and demanding situations, and few studies have addressed this topic. It is essential to respond to intoxicated patients who are admitted to the ICU with empathy and dignity, as well as to learn how to identify factors that lead to provocation and agitation in order to reduce the occurrence of dangerous situations. Education is warranted and must be enhanced, including knowledge about drug abuse and training in communication and empathy Nursing should include an understanding of what the disease of drug abuse means and the development of the ability to see the person behind the abuse and to provide non-judgemental support.","","2021-02-11 04:12:04","2021-02-11 04:12:04","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article; Early Access","","","","","nursing; illicit drugs; intensive critical care; intoxicated patients","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One method for addressing both of these goals is teaching empathy during professional training to foster connection and commonality across differences. The authors describe a pilot improvisational theater (improv) course and present the preliminary outcomes showing its impact on interprofessional empathy. Approach In 2016-2017, the authors piloted a 15-hour course to teach interprofessional empathy to health professions students at the University of Wisconsin-Madison using improv techniques. The authors used a convergent mixed-methods design to evaluate the course's impact on interprofessional empathy. Students enrolled in the course (intervention group, n = 45) and a comparison group (n = 41) completed 2 validated empathy questionnaires (Interpersonal Reactivity Index [IRI], Consultative and Relational Empathy [CARE] measure) and a facial expression recognition task to measure empathy in the pre- and postintervention periods. Differences were examined using paired t tests. Semistructured interviews were conducted with 8 course participants to gain a deeper understanding of the course's effects. Outcomes The intervention group's mean scores on 5 CARE items improved significantly: ease, care, explain, help, and plan. On the IRI, personal distress levels decreased significantly in both the intervention and comparison groups. In the interviews, students who took the class reported a positive impact on their interprofessional relationships and on their ability to think on their feet. They also reported improv influenced other areas of their lives, including patient care and interactions with people outside their work life. Next Steps The authors have continued to offer the course. They aim to conduct a randomized controlled study with medical students and test durability by measuring empathy again 3-6 months following the intervention.","2020-08","2021-02-11 04:12:04","2021-02-11 04:12:04","","1210-1214","","8","95","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA Publisher: LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We show that agents controlled by artificial neural networks can learn via reinforcement learning to pass simple tests that require some aspects of perspective taking capabilities. We studied whether this ability is more readily learned by agents with information encoded in allocentric or egocentric form for both their visual perception and motor actions.

It is useful to develop a deeper understanding of digital play and to explore ways in which caregivers can guide young people in their play to recognize and develop different types of learning. This article attempts to address these issues through proposing a metalanguage for digital play. The theoretical orientation adopted in this article is that of social semiotics and critical multiliteracies. Our focus is on harnessing the affordances of digital play for learning by systematizing them into a metalanguage based on social semiotic theory that models the meaning potential of semiotic resources into the representation, engagement, and organization functions.

We must identify the humanity in others, and the common humanity in their struggle, while affirming particular identities and challenging differential privilege: an anthropological imagination inspires radical empathy and solidarity, reminding us, in the words of the World Social Forum, that “another world is possible.” How people learn to cultivate this anthropological imagination and bring it in the service of marginalized groups is not generally discussed, and rarely taught.

The assessment of our psychological traits is a useful tool when we require them to simulate empathy. Since the creation of social media platforms, numerous studies dealt with measuring personality traits by gathering users' information from their social media profiles. Real world applications showed how natural language processing combined with supervised machine learning algorithms are effective in this field. These applications have some limitations such as focusing on English text only and not considering polysemy in text. In this paper, we propose a multilingual model that handles polysemy by analyzing sentences as a semantic ensemble of interconnected words. The proposed approach processes Facebook posts from the myPersonality dataset and it turns them into a high-dimensional array of features, which are then exploited by a deep neural network architecture based on transformer to perform regression. We prove the effectiveness of our work by comparing the mean squared error of our model with existing baselines and the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the relative data distributions. We obtained state-of-the-art results in personality traits estimation from social media posts for all five personality traits.","2020-04","2021-02-11 04:12:05","2021-02-11 04:12:05","","","","4","11","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND Publisher: MDPI Type: Article","","","","","deep learning; affective computing; natural language processing; Big 5; multilingual embeddings; personality dimensions; sentence embeddings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of this review is to gain a deeper grasp of what undergraduate nursing students are learning from interventions educators have designed to cultivate empathy by synthesizing qualitative data. Review methods: Utilizing the review methodology proposed by Whittemore and Knafl, a survey of the CINAHL, Web of Science, PubMed, and PsychINFO databases was undertaken to answer the question: What are undergraduate nursing students' perceptions of interventions designed to foster empathy? Results: A thematic synthesis of the students' perceptions from the 17 articles meeting inclusion criteria revealed five themes: Understanding the other's experience, embodying the other's experience, becoming aware of self, informing the role of the nurse, and learning or transforming. Conclusions: Although additional conceptual work remains to create a coherent, complete, and parsimonious definition of empathy, the results indicate that the students are gaining many of the facets assumed to be part of the concept of empathy through these educational interventions. Immersive simulations that put students in the role of the “other” were particularly impactful, especially if they created a disorienting dilemma followed by guided reflection. These findings can help nursing educators tailor their interventions for their specific intended learning outcomes.","2020-03","2021-02-11 04:12:05","2021-02-11 04:12:05","","","","","86","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: JOURNAL PRODUCTION DEPT, ROBERT STEVENSON HOUSE, 1-3 BAXTERS PLACE, LEITH WALK, EDINBURGH EH1 3AF, MIDLOTHIAN, SCOTLAND Publisher: CHURCHILL LIVINGSTONE Type: Review","","","","","Education; Empathy; Simulation; Experiential learning; Qualitative","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of the study is to explore students' opinions about the process of study quality assurance at the Daugavpils University (further - DU), Latvia. The participants of this study were 60 students from 12 master and doctoral study programs at DU. The analysis of structured interviews with the students made it possible to identify the typical characteristic features of DU internal quality assessment. The research showed that students assess highly lecturers' personal qualities (attitude to their profession, personal interest in students' success, empathy, striving for cooperation) and their professional qualities (knowledge of the subject, didactic and communicative competence, and ability to get the feedback from students as well). To promote the cooperation between the students and the academic staff of DU, it is useful to practice trans-disciplinary out-of-study forms. Summer schools for students studying in master and doctoral programs encourage students to think about the future of civilization, about a sustainable and unsustainable behaviour on a local and global scale, goals of a sustainable development and awareness about them, and also about the role of a qualitative education content and study environment for achieving these goals. The use of international summer schools, academic discussions and creative work-shops contribute to a deeper understanding of the study content, of topicalities in global education and possibilities of synergetic thinking in cooperation between students and lecturers.","2020","2021-02-11 04:12:06","2021-02-11 04:12:06","","48-54","","","","","","","Rural Environment Education Personality","","","","LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES","LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA","English","","","","","","","ISSN: 2255-8071 Issue: 13 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>13th Annual International Scientific Conference on Rural Environment, Education, Personality (REEP), Latvia Univ Life Sci, Jelgava, LATVIA, 2020</p>","","","","out-of-study forms in a higher education institution; study process quality assurance","Dislere, V","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Mental health appears ripe for such disruption given the global illness burden, stigma, and shortage of care providers. Objective: To characterize the global psychiatrist community's opinion regarding the potential of future autonomous technology (referred to here as AI/ML) to replace key tasks carried out in mental health practice. Design: Cross sectional, random stratified sample of psychiatrists registered with Sermo, a global networking platform open to verified and licensed physicians. Main outcome measures: We measured opinions about the likelihood that AI/ML tools would be able to fully replace - not just assist - the average psychiatrist in performing 10 key psychiatric tasks. Among those who considered replacement likely, we measured opinions about how many years from now such a capacity might emerge. We also measured psychiatrist's perceptions about whether benefits of AI/ML would outweigh the risks. Results: Survey respondents were 791 psychiatrists from 22 countries representing North America, South America, Europe and Asia-Pacific. Only 3.8 % of respondents felt it was likely that future technology would make their jobs obsolete and only 17 % felt that future AI/ML was likely to replace a human clinician for providing empathetic care. Documenting and updating medical records (75 %) and synthesizing information (54 %) were the two tasks where a majority predicted that AI/ML could fully replace human psychiatrists. Female- and US-based doctors were more uncertain that the benefits of AI would outweigh risks than male- and non-US doctors, respectively. Around one in 2 psychiatrists did however predict that their jobs would be substantially changed by AI/ML. Conclusions: Our findings provide compelling insights into how physicians think about AI/ML which in turn may help us better integrate technology and reskill doctors to enhance mental health care.","2020-01","2021-02-11 04:12:06","2021-02-11 04:12:06","","","","","102","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS Publisher: ELSEVIER Type: Article","","","","","Deep learning; Empathy; Autonomous agents; Mental health","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, it is important to pay attention to the demands for education and training in support of the labour markets. The knowledge-oriented nature of work requires that all individuals must be literate, take responsibility for actions (learning) and learn how to think. High demands are set for the personal skills of individuals as they are responsible for their personal development as well as for establishing their quality of life. Individuals, therefore, need more knowledge and insight, a higher consciousness of the self and a greater ability to motivate the self. High demands are made towards the interpersonal skills of individuals, including, amongst others, empathy (orientation to service delivery) and social skills (communication, conflict management, team building skills, cooperation, initiating change). In the opinion of the authors, transformative and holistic continuing or lifelong self-directed learning is vital to addressing the gap between the knowledge and skills which learners acquire at school and the knowledge and skills which are relevant in the labour market and the twenty-first century. We argue, firstly, that transformative and holistic continuing self-directed learning with its purpose and function is essential for human functioning. Secondly, the connection between transformative and holistic continuing self-directed learning and success requires a change in ways of thinking (a mindshift). Thirdly, transformative and holistic continuing self-directed learning results in successful change in the individual learner. The fourth reason which the authors provide is that transformative and holistic continuing self-directed learning is essential to becoming successful in a labour market context. In addition, we believe that transformative and holistic continuing self-directed learning involves action learning, since individuals must learn while they are thinking about issues and working on real problems to implement real solutions. It can be seen as a systematic process that builds on the experiences, knowledge and skills of individuals, while individuals must also be encouraged to question learning content, which can lead to the creation of new knowledge. The information explosion requires the education system to move from a pervasive teacher-directed approach to a more learner-centred approach to prepare school learners for the labour market and the twenty-first century. The authors support the discourse that education institutions must deliver learners who will have a high degree of self-directedness in learning and become transformed lifelong self-directed individuals who do not merely focus on the product (market) but realise the value of the learning process. Education requires a paradigm shift that includes the relevance of alternative teaching-learning strategies and methods like SDL and problem solving in which learners are functionally immersed in deep thinking and occupied with their learning. The above statement is vital to creating citizens who can think independently, creatively solve problems and assume their positions as contributing citizens of the society. According to the authors, (life-long) SDL is of great importance in filling the gap between the knowledge and skills that learners must master at school on the one hand and the knowledge and skills that are relevant for the labour market and society of the twenty-first century on the other. Education in the twenty-first century should, therefore, be recognised as an important tool for dealing with the challenges of the 21st century, but it cannot be used in isolation (Knowles, Holton & Swanson 2015). Thus, this study indicates that it is essential that the skills that the twenty-first century societies and workplaces demand be developed in schools. In addition, the educational needs, general objectives in the Curriculum and Assessment Policy Statement of South Africa (CAPS), the twenty-first century skills and the skills needed for individuals to function amidst the fourth industrial revolution should be combined in an effort to contribute to (lifelong) SDL.","2019-12","2021-02-11 04:12:06","2021-02-11 04:12:06","","512-529","","4","59","","","","","","","","","","Afrikaans","","","","","","","Place: P.

The authors sought to identify attitudes, habits, and other factors that sustain humanism in academic surgical faculty, and compare these with attributes determined from a previous study of internal medicine faculty. Method A mixed-methods study design at University of Pennsylvania Health System was employed from 2016 to 2018 using a survey instrument and semistructured interviews. Surgical residents nominated faculty who exemplified humanism. In-depth interviews were then conducted with surgeons receiving the most nominations. The interviews were transcribed, and common themes were identified using the grounded theory method. These were compared with findings from a previous internal medicine study. Results Ten faculty described three strongly shared attitudes: humility, responsibility, and a desire to live up to a high standard of professional behavior. Five habits were found important to sustaining these attitudes and their practice: self-reflection, finding deep connections with patients, maintaining personal and professional relationships, “having fun” at work, and paying it forward to surgical trainees. Surgeons also cited the importance of past role models in developing humanistic attitudes and sustaining practice. Responses were compared with previously documented attitudes and habits of humanistic internal medicine faculty at the institution. Conclusions This study identified recurring attitudes and habits that characterize humanistic behaviors in a cohort of academic surgeons. Learning from these exemplary humanistic surgeons may inform the development of future educational programs for residents and faculty in sustaining humanism.","2019-07","2021-02-11 04:12:06","2021-02-11 04:12:06","","1027-1032","","7","94","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA Publisher: LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Internal motivational factors for studying medicine (e.g., care for patients, save lives) coupled with a deep approach to learning have been positively related to empathy in contrast to external motivational factors (e.g., future earning potential, prestige) and surface learning. However, assessments of these assumptions among medical school candidates are scarce. This study examined the relationship between different motivational factors and empathy among students enrolled in a selection year in medicineby testing the mediating role of learning approaches. A sample of 572 candidates for medical studies answered a self-reported questionnaire half way through their selection year. Measures included internal and external motivational factors for studying medicine, deep and surface learning approaches and empathy. Path-analysis tested the mediation effects of deep and surface approaches to learning on the relationship of internal and external motivational factors with empathy. The deep learning approach partially mediated the significant positive association between internal motivational factors and empathy, while the surface learning approach fully mediated the significant negative association between external motivational factors and empathy. These results suggest that learning approaches could be a pathway by which internal and external motives for studying medicine are related to empathy among medical school candidates. Pedagogical strategies and educational environments accounting for individual differences in motivation and learning may contribute to training students to become professional and caring doctors in the future.","2019-05","2021-02-11 04:12:06","2021-02-11 04:12:06","","287-300","","2","24","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article","","","","","Empathy; Learning approaches; Motivational factors; Undergraduate medical students","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of the study was to analyze the effects of including autobiographical tools in written reflection. Participants used three tools from the genre of autobiography as they reflected on their learning inside either course content, internship experiences, experiential learning, or goal-setting. Over 500 samples were gathered, offering a large data set for analysis of what kinds of best practice produce quality reflective writing. Through analysis of the data and student surveys and interviews, results show increased attention to critical thinking and metacognition; expressed flexibility, adaptability, and ability to handle ambiguity; and value in connection to others/empathy-building as a result of incorporating autobiographical tools in reflective prompts. The study indicated that reflections using the same autobiographical tool over the course of several sessions seemed to produce deeper levels of reflection and more engagement with the autobiographical tool. Of the three autobiographical tools used in the study, the tool that seemed most helpful to participants was reflection as storytelling that revealed aspects of the self.","2019-03-04","2021-02-11 04:12:07","2021-02-11 04:12:07","","201-217","","2","20","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND Publisher: ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD Type: Article","","","","","experiential learning; critical thinking; Reflection; teacher education; autobiography; goal setting; written reflection","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the course of their education, nurses learn how to become important conduits for information on diabetes management during their eventual interactions with patients. Exploring the status and trends of diabetes-related knowledge in nursing students is one method to explore the idea that one's community affects how one sees disease. However, they are not yet experts, which places them in a period of transition. This study used data mined from the Shadow Health Digital Clinical Experience (TM) virtual patient exams conducted by nursing students between the years of 2012 and 2015 to find any potential demographic or spatial trends within simulation performance results from nursing students who examined a virtual patient with self-managed diabetes. Findings of the analysis indicated that age and experience affected the way in which an examination was conducted, where older and more experienced nursing students asked 8% fewer examination questions, yet showed 32% more empathy and offered 76% more educational statements than their younger counterparts. Spatial trends were less pronounced, although deeper analysis revealed that students in states closer to the national mean for population rate with diabetes perform better, show more empathy, and offer more educational statements during examinations compared to states well above or well below the national mean. This suggests that targeted information may be preferable to “one-sizefits-all” public health awareness and education programs for diabetes programs used uniformly across the country.","2019-02","2021-02-11 04:12:07","2021-02-11 04:12:07","","225-230","","","222","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND Publisher: PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD Type: Article","","","","","Data mining; Demographics; Diabetes; Nursing students; Spatial analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ethnographic research and participatory design methods were part of a collaborative process aimed at empowering students in creating a sustainable community for the residents of Tilaco, Mexico. Student teams discovered the real needs of the community through ethnographic research, and were involved in daily activities of the community, the important events, and the festivities. This built deep empathy with the people with whom students were designing, getting to understand who they are, what they do, what they think and feel. The attitude was about understanding the emotional needs of the users. In conjunction with the ethnographic information determined during the discovery phase, students applied participatory design methods throughout the process, beginning with activities that helped community members create a vision for their development. Students adapted participatory methods to all the phases of the design process, which were implemented through community workshops. These workshops helped to address complexities, empower community, and balance the need to preserve natural/cultural resources. The student and community's work culminated in co-design proposals of high social impact through key strategic actions including the construction of small-scale and environmentally responsible projects.","2019","2021-02-11 04:12:07","2021-02-11 04:12:07","","","","","","","","","E&PDE","","","","DESIGN SOC","109 DUNDEE DRIVE, GLASGOW, G52 3HL, SCOTLAND","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: Dept Design, Mfg & Engn Management; Design Soc, Design Educ Special Interest Grp; Inst Engn Designers Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>21st International Conference on Engineering and Product Design Education (E and PDE), Univ Strathclyde Technol &amp; Innovat Ctr, Glasgow, SCOTLAND, SEP 11-13, 2019</p>","","","","civic mindedness; ethnographic studies; participatory design; rural community development; Service-learning","Bohemia, E and Kovacevic, A and Buck, L and Brisco, R and Evans, D and Grierson, H and Ion, W and Whitfield, RI","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The developed chatbot summarizes emotional state of the user during the survey through percentages of the tracked facial expressions throughout the conversation with the chatbot. Facial expression tracking for happy, neutral, and hurt had 66.7%, 16.7%, and 56.7% tracking accuracy, respectively.

Emotional tone in language in addition to facial expressions are strong indicators of dramatic sentiment in conversation that warrant an empathetic response. To automatically recognize such instances, we develop a multimodal deep neural network for identifying opportunities when the agent should express positive or negative empathetic responses.

To gain insights into pharmacy students' experiences in learning human anatomy using qualitative interviews and thematic analysis. Methods. Participants included Master of Pharmacy students at the end of their first year or the beginning of their second year. The study used a transcendental phenomenological design. Data were collected using semi-structured individual interviews that were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis was used to identify structural and textural components of participants' experiences using data management software. Results. Sixteen participants were recruited and interviewed. Students described developing an understanding of anatomy that differed from their previous experiences, focusing on variation in anatomical structures between patients, and developing professional attributes such as empathy and respect. Students described haptic learning that acted as a hook on which to anchor additional learning from textbooks and lectures. Finally, students perceived the experience as valuable to their future careers as caring professionals. Conclusion. The results of this qualitative study demonstrate that the value of teaching anatomy to undergraduate students goes beyond developing a broad knowledge of anatomical structures, but also engages a deeper conceptual appreciation of professionalism, thereby inducting them into a community of professional practice.","2019","2021-02-11 04:12:09","2021-02-11 04:12:09","","1782-1789","","8","83","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 1426 PRINCE STREET, ALEXANDRIA, VA 22314-2815 USA Publisher: AMER ASSOC COLL PHARMACY Type: Article","","","","","education; anatomy; pharmacy; professionalism; qualitative interviews","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although much work in human-robot interaction describes the meaningful relationships that humans forge with their robots in one-on-one encounters, when robots venture into places where humans cannot go - in search and rescue operations, ocean voyages, or even into space - they do so as part of a large human team. Decisions about what the robot should do and where it should go are therefore the result of large group interactions instead of individual human cognition: the realm of organizational sociology. This talk draws on over a decade of ethnography with NASA's robotic spacecraft missions, specifically focusing on the Mars Exploration Rover mission. Going behind the scenes of the mission, I show the meaning-making, emotional connections, and embodied synergy that scientists develop as they work with their robots millions of miles away on a daily basis. This begins by learning to see through the robots' “eyes” on another planet, yet the peculiar social arrangement of mission work produces a deeper connection to the robot explorers too: one that is no doubt responsible for the extraordinary success and unexpected longevity of the mission team. Studying robotic spacecraft teams demonstrates how humans build a particular and peculiar empathy with their robotic colleagues that goes beyond anthropomorphism. Instead, this case points to the many and unusual ways in which organizations participate in our interactions with, understanding of, and ultimately care for the robots we work with in everyday life.","2019","2021-02-11 04:12:10","2021-02-11 04:12:10","","152","","","","","","","ACM IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction","","","","IEEE","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: Assoc Comp Machinery; IEEE; IEEE Robot & Automat Soc; ACM SIGCHI; ACM SIGAI; AAAI; Korea Tourism Org; Daegu Convent & Visitors Bur; ColorfulDaegu ISSN: 2167-2121 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>14th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), Daegu, SOUTH KOREA, MAR 11-14, 2019</p>","","","","Teamwork; Human-Robot Interaction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It considers pedagogical structure and phenomenological dimensions over an array of study abroad and immersive learning conditions. This paper illustrates rich and impactful ways that learning can unfold, including the unintended consequences of education that opens eyes, changes perspectives and builds empathy. Methodology This paper deploys a case study method whereby three unique programs for studio education are critically considered/analyzed. The research connects cases and delineates approaches in environmental design, whereby greater understanding and deeper knowledge can be attained. Findings This paper, through study of cases of immersive learning, reveals effective ways in which studio teaching can serve to heighten sensitivity, construct rich self/world views and render visible more profound knowledge. Such knowledge transcends disciplinary boundaries and professional borders - encompassing a fuller spectrum of awareness that includes the social, the cultural and the spiritual. Research limitations/implications This paper investigates studio-based graduate education in Environmental Design, with a particular focus on Architecture/Planning. As such, there are limitations to the applicability of discoveries and revelations. That said, the general model for teaching and learning may have value across disciplines well beyond those examined in the current research. Practical implications In an increasingly complex world, where cultures and values routinely collide, the research presents pedagogical approaches that promise to erode walls, dissolve barriers and counter fragmentation. The case studies illustrate effective ways to heighten learning beyond the ethos of traditional classes and conventional classrooms. Originality/value This paper proffers bold creative models for teaching that defy everyday strategies. It encourages moving students to places/spaces, both concrete and abstract, that challenge their assumptions, test their capabilities and permit exceptional personal/professional growth.","2019","2021-02-11 04:12:11","2021-02-11 04:12:11","","318-332","","2, SI","48","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND Publisher: EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD Type: Article","","","","","Holism; Systems; Education; Design; Culture; Pedagogy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Drug court provides a unique learning experience for pharmacy students. Methods: Students from Purdue University College of Pharmacy and the University of Minnesota College of Pharmacy participated in drug court and provided written reflections regarding their experiences. Analysis of reflections explored how students' life experiences might be associated with their understanding of substance use disorder, and how the drug court experience might impact students' attitudes regarding substance use disorder as well as professional and personal development. Results: Consensual qualitative analysis of student pharmacist reflections of the drug court experience led to eleven distinct themes: description of the student experience at drug court; past experiences and exposures; past perceptions and judgments; stereotype deconstruction; empathy development; development of impartiality and fair-minded approach; situational appreciation; analytical thinking; role of the pharmacist; metacognition; and science of substance use disorder. Discussion: Colleges of pharmacy wishing to provide students with an opportunity for personal and professional development focused on substance use disorder and recovery should explore experiential learning opportunities in drug court settings. Conclusions: The drug court experience allows student pharmacist learners to gain a deeper personal understanding of substance use disorder while examining their own biases. Students reported that this experience challenges them to rethink notions of “good” and “bad” and reflect on personal preconceived views about substance use disorder and morality.","2018-10","2021-02-11 04:12:11","2021-02-11 04:12:11","","1331-1341","","10","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA Publisher: ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC Type: Article","","","","","Bias; Addiction; Consensual qualitative research; Problem-solving courts; Stigma; Substance use disorder","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"89S9VMWE","journalArticle","2018","van der Walt, Johannes L.","Forgiveness education in schools as a possible measure to prevent future social and emotional pain","TYDSKRIF VIR GEESTESWETENSKAPPE","","0041-4751","10.17159/2224-7912/2018/v58n2a9","","It was assumed for purposes of this article that many of the cases of people seeking counselling as a result of social and emotional pain due to social injustice inflicted upon them could have been prevented if they had been taught how to ask for and to extend forgiveness. (This of course does not imply that forgiveness education will remove all such social and emotional pain.) Children need to be taught how to deal with social injustices such as bullying, thereby saving them social and emotional pain later in their lives. Literature abounds with incidents that require forgiveness. The record of incidents underlines the need for incorporating forgiveness education in formal school programs. As far as could be established, forgiveness education has not yet been incorporated anywhere as a formal school subject. However, provision has been made in many education systems for its inclusion in, for instance, Citizenship Education and other formative subjects. In South Africa it could form part of the Life Orientation and Life Skills programs currently taught in schools. The purpose of this article is to provide school educators (teachers) with guidelines for teaching forgiveness education in schools, if (and when) it is incorporated in the formal curriculum. The rationale for including forgiveness education in the formal school curriculum can be explicated in terms of the social space and ethical function theory. Forgiveness and forgiveness education should occur in the social space resulting from the infliction of a social injury upon a person or group. Forgiveness education in turn should occur in the educational space provided by schools and other pedagogical settings. According to the principle of sovereignty in own sphere, schools are unique in that they embody pedagogical and didactical spaces. The school is firstly pedagogically focused upon the guiding, unfolding, nurturing, forming and developing of the learners to prepare them for a future as mature and responsible adults who understand the process of forgiveness. In this process, schools will secondly typically employ the didactical art and skill of teaching how and when to forgive. The theory also encapsulates the notion that the space in which forgiveness education is to occur should be ethical in that it displays and promotes love, patience and empathy, responsible and accountable interaction with the learners and a deeper understanding among learners as a caring community. According to this perspective, the school approaches forgiveness and forgiveness education as part of the moral development of the learners. Against the backdrop outlined above, the following is suggested as a “syllabus” or “subject curriculum” for forgiveness education: The first step of the forgiveness process to be taught is that a person should understand the context in which the apparent injustice has taken place. Children should be able to distinguish between a no-harm situation and one in which genuine injustice has been inflicted. Actions are always context-sensitive. This is the uncovering phase in which the person becomes aware of personal emotions and of the pain brought about by the actions of another. The second step is to gain insight into the function of anger, dissatisfaction and resentment. The forgiveness process begins with anger and resentment. It is important, however, to distinguish between productive, and sinful and senseless anger. Anger is productive if it helps one understand what has occurred, if one remains in charge of the anger, if the anger does not deteriorate into childish self-centredness, does not destroy the other person and if it helps one in choosing to forgive. The injured person should abjure all forms of reactive anger, that is anger that insists on revenge and retribution, and rather opt for transitional anger, i.e. forward-looking anger rooted in thoughts of well-being for both the injured and the injurer, in empathy for both the self and the other. The third step in the forgiveness process is to realise that the injustice or injury is of a permanent nature. The injury will never disappear and will never be forgotten, and therefore has to be dealt with. The fourth step is to realise that forgiveness begins with oneself and not with the injurer. To forgive is not a token of weakness; forgiveness is always granted from a position of strength because it ultimately results in healing of the self and the other. It liberates one from unhappiness and resentment and is an act of mercy to the self. It now becomes important to distinguish between two kinds of forgiveness: conditional and unconditional, and to realise that it is by far better to forgive unconditionally. The fifth step is an active decision to forgive, a step inspired by empathy for the perpetrator. To forgive is not just to forget or to pardon but rather to set the perpetrator and oneself free. An unforgiving attitude deprives one from opportunities of becoming what one could have been, namely a healed person. This is the decision-making phase in the forgiveness process. The sixth step is the workphase. The injured person invokes various cognitive and affective forgiveness strategies. One of the most important tasks in this phase is to reframe the perpetrator, in other words to attempt to view him or her in a more favourable light. Reframing ideally results in greater empathy with the injurer. The seventh step entails viewing forgiveness as a gift. It is only once one has forgiven the other that one is set free completely. The process ends with the outcome phase. The injured person begins reaping benefits from the process in the sense of beginning to grow spiritually after the dissipation of anger and the liberation from feelings of injustice. The way is now paved for a conflict- free future. The previously injured person can now become more pro-social, more morally responsible and develop a stronger sense of belonging. Enmity and alienation are replaced by a sense of peace. Empirical evidence has shown that people and groups who have successfully forgiven tend to display lower stress and anxiety levels, more positive relationships, gain more hope for the future and for life in general, and have a more positive view of the self. This is because they have successfully liberated themselves as well as the injurer from the burden of an unforgiving attitude. Only people who have been instructed in the process of forgiving during their formative years, who have been taught and as a result have learned what it means to forgive even the unforgiveable will be able to comply with the dictum of doing unto others what you would want them do unto you, able to care for their interests as if those interests were your own. Not many people are able to do what one of the mothers of the Gugulethu 7 spontaneously did when she unconditionally forgave one of the murderers of her son during the apartheid era. In doing so, she demonstrated that she had mastered the steps of the forgiveness process outlined above. Most other people require instruction in the forgiveness process to be able to emulate her example.","2018-06","2021-02-11 04:12:11","2021-02-11 04:12:11","","344-360","","2","58","","","","","","","","","","Afrikaans","","","","","","","Place: P.

The teachers shared philosophical foundations reflected in their practice and discourse in the classroom as they took a learning journey through Harvard Project Zero's Out of Eden Learn project. Out of Eden Learn serves as a platform to engage children from both settings in exploring their own neighborhoods, investigating contemporary global issues, and reflecting on how they as individuals fit into a broader geographical and historical context. Through meaningful hands-on experiences, the children in these two classrooms gained deep understandings of themselves and their surroundings, made personal connections and developed empathy as they heard stories of children around the world. In their learning journey, the two teachers used thinking routines to help the children slow down and observe the world around them. The experience not only helped the teachers comply with curriculum standards, but also allowed them to keep alive the children's capacity to be curious and promote parental involvement. The children developed a sense of self-understanding and self-identity as a point of reference to develop perspective and understanding of other cultures.","2018-05","2021-02-11 04:12:12","2021-02-11 04:12:12","","301-312","","3","46","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article","","","","","Culture and language; Empathy and resilience; Global competencies; Habits of mind; Slow looking; Thinking routines","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This article offers a method and tools for teaching active listening that can be implemented in online, hybrid, or face-to-face platforms. We begin by reviewing the great demand for listening skills, in light of how little time is spent on listening instruction compared with that on speaking instruction. We then present a set of learning materials and a procedure for using them that includes both pre- and posttests, multimedia learning materials, and exercises that enhance skill development. We follow the learning plan with analyses of both quantitative and qualitative data, showing support for the suggested method.

Negative attitudes and disrespect among healthcare workers has been identified by the homeless as a barrier to healthcare. A service learning experience with a vulnerable population has been shown to change nursing students' attitudes and beliefs. A large university in a southern city partnered with a community based organization that provided services to the homeless to educate senior nursing students in a service learning experience. The goal of this project was to examine attitudes and perceptions of nursing students toward the homeless population before and after participation in a service learning clinical practicum experience. This case study utilized a pre and post experience questionnaire to collect qualitative data for the purposes of the project. The findings revealed students demonstrated a decrease in fear, an increase in empathy, and a deeper understanding of the advocacy role of nurses for people experiencing homelessness. Nurse educators are challenged to engage students with vulnerable populations to change the attitudes and perceptions for improvement in the overall health of communities served worldwide.

Understanding how interlocutors tend to adapt to each other's speaking style through entrainment involves measuring a range of acoustic features and comparing those via multiple signal comparison methods. In this work, we present a turn-level distance measure obtained in an unsupervised manner using a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model, which we call Neural Entrainment Distance (NED). This metric establishes a framework that learns an embedding from the population wide entrainment in an unlabeled training corpus. We use the framework for a set of acoustic features and validate the measure experimentally by showing its efficacy in distinguishing real conversations from fake ones created by randomly shuffling speaker turns. Moreover, we show real world evidence of the validity of the proposed measure. We find that high value of NED is associated with high ratings of emotional bond in suicide assessment interviews, which is consistent with prior studies.","2018","2021-02-11 04:12:12","2021-02-11 04:12:12","","3423-3427","","","","","","","Interspeech","","","","ISCA-INT SPEECH COMMUNICATION ASSOC","C/O EMMANUELLE FOXONET, 4 RUE DES FAUVETTES, LIEU DIT LOUS TOURILS, BAIXAS, F-66390, FRANCE","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: Int Speech Commun Assoc ISSN: 2308-457X Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>19th Annual Conference of the International-Speech-Communication-Association (INTERSPEECH 2018), Hyderabad, INDIA, AUG 02-SEP 06, 2018</p>","","","","behavioral analysis; conversational speech; deep neural network; embeddings; entrainment; unsupervised learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The ECHO model is utilized to expand access to care of common and complex diseases by supporting the education of primary care providers with an interprofessional team of specialists via videoconferencing networks. Intervention: Mock ECHO trainings are conducted through a train the trainer model targeted at leaders replicating the ECHO model at their organizations. Trainers conduct simulated teleECHO clinics while participants gain skills to improve communication and self-efficacy. Context: Three focus groups, conducted between May 2015 and January 2016 with a total of 26 participants, were deductively analyzed to identify common themes related to simulation-based medical education and interdisciplinary education. Principal themes generated from the analysis included (a) the role of empathy in community development, (b) the value of training tools as guides for learning, (c) Mock ECHO design components to optimize learning, (d) the role of interdisciplinary education to build community and improve care delivery, (e) improving care integration through collaboration, and (f) development of soft skills to facilitate learning. Outcome: Mock ECHO trainings offer clinicians the freedom to learn in a noncritical environment while emphasizing real-time multidirectional feedback and encouraging knowledge and skill transfer. Lessons Learned: The success of the ECHO model depends on training interprofessional healthcare providers in behaviors needed to lead a teleECHO clinic and to collaborate in the educational process. While building a community of practice, Mock ECHO provides a safe opportunity for a diverse group of clinician experts to practice learned skills and receive feedback from coparticipants and facilitators.","2018","2021-02-11 04:12:13","2021-02-11 04:12:13","","423-432","","4","30","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND Publisher: ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD Type: Article","","","","","communication skills; curriculum; learning outcomes; mentoring; multiprofessional; phase of education","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Educators recognise that effective and active approaches to teaching are more closely associated with deeper learning. These active approaches aim to develop higher order skills, encouraging learners' critical thinking and decision-making as well as enhancing their capacity to be agile, flexible and adaptable. Among those active approaches stand serious games, which are powerful learning environments that are seen as an emergent and engaging new way of experiment situations and construct knowledge. Serious games, in the form of role-play simulations, are scenario-based games that are used to simulate real life situations. Although serious games and simulations have been widely used in serving educational purposes, there is little evidence on their use in achieving deeper learning. In addition, there is lack of guidelines or a framework for designing serious games to support learners achieve deep learning. This paper proposes a theoretical framework, based on Bloom's educational model for Mastery Learning, which illustrates the design of instructional process adapted for serious games using empathy and creativity as an approach of designing serious games for achieving deeper learning. It describes an approach of evaluating this framework by designing a serious game focusing on raising awareness about domestic violence and abuse.","2018","2021-02-11 04:12:13","2021-02-11 04:12:13","","785-791","","","","","","","Proceedings of the European Conference on Games-Based Learning","","","","ACAD CONFERENCES LTD","CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND","English","","","","","","","ISSN: 2049-0992 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>12th European Conference on Games Based Learning (ECGBL), SKEMA Business Sch, FRANCE, OCT 04-05, 2018</p>","","","","empathy; creativity; deeper learning; formative assessment; role-play simulations; serious games","Ciussi, M","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper explores the concept of critical reflection and considers how engaging with fiction may be an innovative pedagogical approach to support critical learning opportunities. Drawing upon interviews with fiction writers, ways in which critical reflection may be encouraged in connection to reading and writing fiction are taken up by exploring three different thematic areas that relate to a Habermasian framework of knowledge constitutive approaches to learning. These different areas can be categorised as (a) technical-rational, (b) humanistic and (c) critical or emancipatory. The first of these considers critical reflection as a way to develop technical capacities as a creative writer. The next section takes up a humanistic framework to explore the value of individual and collective learning opportunities to enhance personal growth and critical reflection. The third area of discussion considers a deeper critical or emancipatory framework of learning through critical reflection which may lead to social change. The paper concludes by considering the value of arts-informed adult education approaches, such as those related to fiction writing, to enhance the development of critical reflection amongst adult learners.","2018","2021-02-11 04:12:14","2021-02-11 04:12:14","","133-148","","2","40","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND Publisher: ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD Type: Article","","","","","writing; Critical reflection; fiction; imagination","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Enterprises, universities and governments in Beilin are facing with a widespread challenge in the world. Provided particular educational and industry resources, the challenge is to find a practice which is potentially valuable for teaching corporations to improve innovation products, ideas, organizational outcomes related to innovation and explore more innovation outcomes to support the development of economics. In view of this, redefining new multidisciplinary learning to stay abreast of change is in urgent need. Consequently, “design thinking” has generated significant attention in the innovation press and has been heralded as a novel problem-solving methodology well suited to the often-cited challenges different organizations face in encouraging innovation and growth. This paper deals with a project proposing to gradually change the quality and quantity of innovation outcomes in Beilin. Through the combination of online live design thinking courses provided by an American educational institution together with representatives from public agencies and private organizations, an open-loop design thinking curriculum was designed for what has been named as “ Design Talents “ Program. 12 teachers including 2 instructors from American Alliance for International Education teaching design thinking process, 2 teaching assistants (associate professor in the field of design) from China and 8 representatives with technical skills got involved in the maker practice process, assuring that students can acquire a range of capacities during their training. With ages ranging from 19 to 41, a selected group of totally 68 students and representatives from different majors in 14 universities at Beilin District, Xi'an, participated in the first phase training. The results presented, a total of 14 innovation projects were proposed from the training, 3 of which have been set out to break into the market, and 2 of which gained second prize of start-up competition. According to the investigation and deep interview after the training, not only those efficiency and productivity were realized, but also creative confidence, empathy, communication and collaboration, as well as creative behaviors have been fostered. The open-loop design thinking courses constructed an effective route for fostering innovation ability and bringing out more innovation outcomes.","2018","2021-02-11 04:12:14","2021-02-11 04:12:14","","5435-5440","","","","","","","ICERI Proceedings","","","","IATED-INT ASSOC TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION & DEVELOPMENT","LAURI VOLPI 6, VALENICA, BURJASSOT 46100, SPAIN","English","","","","","","","ISSN: 2340-1095 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>11th Annual International Conference of Education, Research and Innovation (ICERI), Seville, SPAIN, NOV 12-14, 2018</p>","","","","Design thinking; Innovation outcomes; Multidisciplinary course","Chova, LG and Martinez, AL and Torres, IC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, classroom lectures can be considered teacher-centered strategies that are conducive to passive learning on behalf of learners. For this reason, there are calls for a shift in medical education away from the traditional lecture approach and toward other instructional approaches that encourage higher-order thinking and active participation from students. One such approach that has received much attention is the flipped classroom, which allows students to independently learn foundational concepts as required homework, and then use this gained knowledge during class time to engage in critical thinking opportunities and application of knowledge. In the flipped classroom model, learners are first exposed to educational content prior to formal class sessions via readings, videos, or other electronic exercises that have been formally assigned. Given that students have already acquired knowledge through this initial phase, the subsequent classroom time is dedicated to activities that allow students to apply their knowledge to challenging problems in a setting that promotes collaboration with peers and feedback and direction from professors. In addition, using formal debate in higher education appears to be a useful tool to prepare students to face the complexity of issues affecting the modern world and to work with individuals with different viewpoints and backgrounds. In fact, using formal debate in higher education has been associated with improving communication and empathy, critical-thinking ability, literature searching, and application of evidence, teamwork, and self-directed learning. Debates allow students an opportunity not only to identify that there is an issue to resolve, but also to demonstrate a deeper analysis of the issue, including appraisal, critique, and reasoning of the issue for a potential solution. Flipped classroom together with formal debate were proposed to medical students as innovative methodologies to improve communication skills and critical thinking in response to the demand to have future biomedical professionals better trained in these areas. The general aim of the innovation experience was to encourage the active participation of students in the construction of knowledge, as well as to develop didactic strategies for their autonomous learning and to design active processes of acquisition of skills and abilities for their professional performance. Here, we report the expectations of medical students from Complutense University of Madrid on their future participation in the afore-mentioned innovation activity. Participants considered that the experience would help them gain confidence and security when it comes to presenting scientific facts, be fluent when talking in public, and expand their knowledge on some controversial topics. Regarding the negative aspects, some showed concern about being sufficiently prepared to carry out the activity with guaranteed success, taking into account that for a significant part of the students it was the first time that they participated in an innovative activity that combined both flipped learning and formal debate.","2018","2021-02-11 04:12:15","2021-02-11 04:12:15","","6140-6146","","","","","","","ICERI Proceedings","","","","IATED-INT ASSOC TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION & DEVELOPMENT","LAURI VOLPI 6, VALENICA, BURJASSOT 46100, SPAIN","English","","","","","","","ISSN: 2340-1095 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>11th Annual International Conference of Education, Research and Innovation (ICERI), Seville, SPAIN, NOV 12-14, 2018</p>","","","","Communication skills; Critical thinking; Flipped classroom; Formal debate; Health Sciences","Chova, LG and Martinez, AL and Torres, IC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many progressive software product companies today are empowering cross-functional product teams to own their product to collectively understand the product context, the true product needs, and manage its on-going evolution. Some teams do this better than others and neither established requirements elicitation and validation processes nor conventional team leadership practices explain the reasons for the differences. This research inquires into how cross-functional product teams, as a collective, create and nurture a shared mental model that accurately represents the external product domain and its realities. The research also examines how teams use that collective understanding to shape development plans, internal and external communications, new team member onboarding, etc. The aim of this research is to develop substantive theory that describes how self-directed, cross-functional product development teams take an empathic-based approach to discovering, understanding, and maintaining a deep, collective understanding of the domain and true product needs. This theory will support software product development leaders in creating richer conditions for teams to grok.","2018","2021-02-11 04:12:15","2021-02-11 04:12:15","","466-471","","","","","","","International Requirements Engineering Conference","","","","IEEE COMPUTER SOC","10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: IEEE; IEEE Comp Soc; Intel Inc; Tata Consulting Services; Univ Calgary, Schulich Sch Engn; NSF; IEEE Tech Council Software Engn; Reuse Co; Iteratec; Univ Hamburg; Int Requirements Engn Board; Springer ISSN: 2332-6441 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>26th IEEE International Requirements Engineering Conference (RE), Banff Ctr Arts &amp; Creativ, Banff, CANADA, AUG 20-24, 2018</p>","","","","knowledge management; collective sensemaking; complex adaptive systems; design science; empathy-driven development; requirements validation; tacit knowledge; team learning","Ruhe, G and Maalej, W and Amyot, D","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In order to provide a natural interaction experience, these social robots need to recognise the emotions expressed by the users across various modalities of communication and use them to estimate an internal affective model of the interaction. These internal emotions act as motivation for learning to respond to the user in different situations, using the physical capabilities of the robot. This paper proposes a deep hybrid neural model for multi-modal affect recognition, analysis and behaviour modelling in social robots. The model uses growing self-organising network models to encode intrinsic affective states for the robot. These intrinsic states are used to train a reinforcement learning model to learn facial expression representations on the Neuro-Inspired Companion (NICO) robot, enabling the robot to express empathy towards the users.","2018","2021-02-11 04:12:16","2021-02-11 04:12:16","","","","","","","","","IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","","","","IEEE","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","English","","","","","","","ISSN: 2161-4393 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN), Rio de Janeiro, BRAZIL, JUL 08-13, 2018</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As people interact more often with voice and gesture controlled machines, they expect the machines to recognize different emotions, and understand other high level communication features such as humor, sarcasm and intention. In order to make such communication possible, the machines need an empathy module in them, which is a software system that can extract emotions from human speech and behavior and can decide the correct response of the robot. Although research on empathetic robots is still in the primary stage, current methods involve using signal processing techniques, sentiment analysis and machine learning algorithms to make robots that can `understand' human emotion. Other aspects of human-robot interaction include facial expression and gesture recognition, as well as robot movement to convey emotion and intent. We propose Zara the Supergirl as a prototype system of empathetic robots. It is a software-based virtual android, with an animated cartoon character to present itself on the screen. She will get `smarter' and more empathetic, by having machine learning algorithms, and gathering more data and learning from it.

We were focusing on the concept of interaction among participants in the educational and learning process. We set the following research questions: In which areas can a class teacher influence the quality of pupils' life? What interventions can a class teacher implement to improve the quality of pupils' life? Who can a class teacher cooperate with in this effort and in which educational processes? A qualitative research approach was chosen for the research study. The data was obtained by a deep semi-structured interview. We focused not on how individuals understand and interpret their experience as a class teacher. The analysis of the interviews shows not only what the class teachers considered to be obvious and commonplace, but also what is very challenging and struggling in their work. Class teacher is involved in a complex network of social relationships. Besides personal identity, it is just social identity, i.e. awareness of belonging to a particular social group, sharing and empathy, which are important for communication and relationships. Symmetrical communication is undoubtedly the necessary condition for effective cooperation. The opportunity to overcome stereotypes and categorizations is being created in joint actions. Teachers take care of continuity, proximity and consistency with both children and parents. They emotionally put more into relationships, and they are more interested in good mutual relations. Teachers often tend to be more sympathetic, emphasizing children's needs and harmonious interaction.","2018","2021-02-11 04:12:16","2021-02-11 04:12:16","","3649-3656","","","","","","","EDULEARN Proceedings","","","","IATED-INT ASSOC TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION & DEVELOPMENT","LAURI VOLPI 6, VALENICA, BURJASSOT 46100, SPAIN","English","","","","","","","ISSN: 2340-1117 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>10th International Conference on Education and New Learning Technologies (EDULEARN), Palma, SPAIN, JUL 02-04, 2018</p>","","","","Class teacher; personal identity; quality of pupils' life; social identity; symmetrical communication","Chova, LG and Martinez, AL and Torres, IC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Formative assessment (FA) has emerged to be one of the efficient tools in the development of the above-mentioned competences and thus a topical issue in today's education. A number of studies have produced positive results investigating the use of formative assessment on the development of learner metacognitive and affective skills, student responsibility, active self-regulated learning, viewing learning as a goal rather than an outcome (Anderson, M., 2016; Brookhart, 2009; Chappuis, J., 2016; Fisher & Frey, 2014; [13]). The present study intends to examine the application of formative assessment in language classes at a higher education institution whose mission is to educate citizens for our society through commitment to liberal arts and sciences education. It aims at investigating how the application of formative assessment assists in fostering deep learning, student-centered approach, collaborative and tension free environment, active learning in small groups, enhanced dynamic exchange of feedback between teachers and students as well as self-assessment and peer-assessment both in traditional classroom as well as in virtual learning environment. It also explores the impact of formative assessment upon student lifelong learning skill development. Methodologically, the study is based on an opinion survey, reflection and class observation performed with 181 university students and 21 language teachers. The study has revealed that formative assessment adds significant value to the learning and teaching of languages. It settles very well in the education process based on liberal arts and sciences grounded in the principles of collegiality, cooperative learning, connection-building among all members of the learning and teaching process including students and teachers. It has also shown that the broad possibilities for the successful exploitation of formative assessment in language education are still in need of further in-depth research.","2018","2021-02-11 04:12:17","2021-02-11 04:12:17","","10084-10091","","","","","","","EDULEARN Proceedings","","","","IATED-INT ASSOC TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION & DEVELOPMENT","LAURI VOLPI 6, VALENICA, BURJASSOT 46100, SPAIN","English","","","","","","","ISSN: 2340-1117 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>10th International Conference on Education and New Learning Technologies (EDULEARN), Palma, SPAIN, JUL 02-04, 2018</p>","","","","foreign language learning and teaching; Formative assessment; student-centered approach; tertiary education","Chova, LG and Martinez, AL and Torres, IC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Conventional approaches for bullying incidence identification include questionnaires, conversations and psychological tests. Here, unlike the conventional approaches, two experiments are proposed that involve visual stimuli with cases of bullying- and non-bullying-related ones, set within a 2D (simple video preview) and a Virtual Reality (VR) (immersive video preview) context. In both experimental settings, brain activity is recorded using high density (HD) (256 channels) electroencephalogram (EEG), and analyzed to identify the bullying stimuli type (bullying/non-bullying) and context (2D/VR). The proposed classification analysis uses a convolutional neural network (CNN), applying deep learning on the oscillatory modes (OCMs) embedded within the raw HD EEG data. The extraction of OCMs from the HD EEG data is achieved with swarm decomposition (SWD), which efficiently accounts for the non-stationarity and noise contamination of the raw HD EEG data. Experimental results from 17 subjects indicate that the new SWD/CNN approach achieves high discrimination accuracy (AUC = 0.987 between bullying/non-bullying stimuli type; AUC = 0.975, between bullying/non-bullying stimuli type and 2D/VR context), paving the way for better understanding of how brain's responses could act as indicators of bullying experience within immersive environments.","2017-12-11","2021-02-11 04:12:17","2021-02-11 04:12:17","","","","","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND Publisher: NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Mental health disorder is one of the most common health-threatening problems of older age. Aim: The present qualitative study was conducted with the aim to identify factors that affect the mental health of elderly population. Materials and Methods: This study was a qualitative study with content analysis approach, conducted on the elderly Iranians in Tehran. Purposive sampling method was used to select 15 elderly Iranians. Semi-structured and in-depth interviews were carried out with 15 elderly Iranians in the parks and homes in 2015. To analyze the data, the content of interviews was typed and entered into MAXQDA software. This software was also used to code the data. The interview began with a main question about their experiences of everyday life, and then, exploratory questions to encourage the participants and access to deeper information were required. Results: Two themes of “interaction” and “worthiness”, 5 main categories (communication/relationship, empathy/compassion, entertainment/amusement, support and respect), and 15 subcategories (interpersonal communication, communication with others, communication with God, talking to people, being consulted, being employed, studying and learning, using the media, going to park, family support, social support, social respect, family respect, respect for personal space, and respect for beliefs) were extracted from the data. Conclusion: The results of this study encourage health-care providers to identify the factors that influence the sense of worthiness in elderly by keeping continuous contact with them and taking advantage of the unique opportunity they have to interact with them and influence their belief. By designing educational programs, mental disorders can be prevented, that this population may develop.","2017-11","2021-02-11 04:12:17","2021-02-11 04:12:17","","VC5-VC8","","11","11","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 71 JAIN COLONY, VEER NAGAR, DELHI, 110 007, INDIA Publisher: PREMCHAND SHANTIDEVI RESEARCH FOUNDATION Type: Article","","","","","Content analysis; Elderly; Mental hygiene","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

C.","Self-Guided Web-Based Interventions: Scoping Review on User Needs and the Potential of Embodied Conversational Agents to Address Them","JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH","","1438-8871","10.2196/jmir.7351","","Background: Web-based mental health interventions have evolved from innovative prototypes to evidence-based and clinically applied solutions for mental diseases such as depression and anxiety. Open-access, self-guided types of these solutions hold the promise of reaching and treating a large population at a reasonable cost. However, a considerable factor that currently hinders the effectiveness of these self-guided Web-based interventions is the high level of nonadherence. The absence of a human caregiver apparently has a negative effect on user adherence. It is unknown to what extent this human support can be handed over to the technology of the intervention to mitigate this negative effect. Objective: The first objective of this paper was to explore what is known in literature about what support a user needs to stay motivated and engaged in an electronic health (eHealth) intervention that requires repeated use. The second objective was to explore the current potential of embodied conversational agents (ECAs) to provide this support. Methods: This study reviews and interprets the available literature on (1) support within eHealth interventions that require repeated use and (2) the potential of ECAs by means of a scoping review. The rationale for choosing a scoping review is that the subject is broad, diverse, and largely unexplored. Themes for (1) and (2) were proposed based on grounded theory and mapped on each other to find relationships. Results: The results of the first part of this study suggest the presence of user needs that largely remain implicit and unaddressed. These support needs can be categorized as task-related support and emotion-related support. The results of the second part of this study suggest that ECAs are capable of engaging and motivating users of information technology applications in the domains of learning and behavioral change. Longitudinal studies must be conducted to determine under what circumstances ECAs can create and maintain a productive user relationship. Mapping the user needs on the ECAs' capabilities suggests that different kinds of ECAs may provide different solutions for improving the adherence levels. Conclusions: Autonomous ECAs that do not respond to a user's expressed emotion in real time but take on empathic roles may be sufficient to motivate users to some extent. It is unclear whether those types of ECAs are competent enough and create sufficient believability among users to address the user's deeper needs for support and empathy. Responsive ECAs may offer a better solution. However, at present, most of these ECAs have difficulties to assess a user's emotional state in real time during an open dialogue. By conducting future research with relationship theory-based ECAs, the added value of ECAs toward user needs can be better understood.","2017-11","2021-02-11 04:12:18","2021-02-11 04:12:18","","","","11","19","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 59 WINNERS CIRCLE, TORONTO, ON M4L 3Y7, CANADA Publisher: JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC Type: Review","","","","","review; eHealth; human computer interaction; adherence; clinical psychology; embodied conversational agent; health behavior; intelligent tutoring system; ITS; Web-based intervention","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Memory-work, a feminist, qualitative methodology, was chosen because it centres critical tourism inquiry within the context of sharing meaningful, personal experiences. The team met regularly to engage in supportive, critical dialogue about their memories and to spark critical reflections about tourism more broadly. Four substantive themes (embodied remembering, gendered bodies, racialized bodies, and embodying the gaze) were developed from collective analyses of initial discussions. A deeper reflection on the potential of this approach for engendering critical tourism pedagogy was also undertaken to explore its potential as critical tourism pedagogy. Five pedagogical themes (building safe spaces and developing trust, creating empathy, engaging tourism literature in `real life', opening doors for ongoing reflection, and decentring power and knowledge) were identified. The paper concludes with recommendations for adapting this approach to their own tourism teaching and learning endeavours.","2017-11","2021-02-11 04:12:18","2021-02-11 04:12:18","","163-173","","B, SI","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND Publisher: ELSEVIER SCI LTD Type: Article","","","","","Critical tourism pedagogy; Embodiment; Memory-work; Transformational learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Method: Qualitative design and method were used to collect and analyze data retrieved from private interviews with seven graduate nursing students. Results: The themes were Being There, Think More, and Feeling Rushed. Students recommended the strategy as a measure of learning because it simulated a real patient encounter and made them think at a deeper level than other traditional approaches used to evaluating learning. Conclusion: Poetry might engage nursing students in thinking critically and compassionately and be closer in touch with real-time nursing care than other traditionally used methods to evaluate nursing practice.

Methods: During the years 2010-2012, students reflected on their emotions concerning BBN in a learning assignment at the end of the communications skills course. The students were asked to write a description of how they felt about a BBN case. The reflections were analysed using qualitative content analysis. Results: 351 students agreed to participate in the study. We recognized ten categories in students' reflections namely empathy, insecurity, anxiety, sadness, ambivalence, guilt, hope, frustration, gratefulness and emotional detachment. Most students expressed empathy, but there was a clear tension between feeling empathy and retaining professional distance by emotional detachment. Conclusions: Students experience strong and perplexing emotions during their studies, especially in challenging situations. A deeper understanding of students' emotions is valuable for supporting students' professional development and coping in their work in the future. Practice implications: Medical students need opportunities to reflect on emotional experiences during their education to find strategies for coping with them. Emotions should be actively discussed in studies where the issues of BBN are addressed. Teachers need education in attending emotional issues constructively. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Lack of teachers' insight into students' feedback requirements may be a key, which might be addressed by giving control to the students with student led feedback practices. The conceptual framework was built on three dimensions of learning theory by Illeris and Vygotsky's zone of proximal development and scaffolding. We introduced a feedback session with self-reflection and peer feedback in the form of open discussion on video-recorded student performances under teacher's guidance. The aims of this qualitative study were to explore students' perception on this holistic feedback approach and to investigate ways of maximising effective feedback and learning. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were used to gather data which were evaluated using a thematic analytical approach. The participants were third year medical students of Imperial College London on clinical placements at Hillingdon Hospital. Results: Video based self-reflection helped some students to identify mistakes in communication and technical skills of which they were unaware prior to the session. Those who were new to video feedback found their expected self-image different to that of their actual image on video, leading to some distress. However many also identified that mistakes were not unique to themselves through peer videos and learnt from both model performances and from each other's mistakes. Balancing honest feedback with empathy was a challenge for many during peer discussion. The teacher played a vital role in making the session a success by providing guidance and a supportive environment. Conclusions: This study has demonstrated many potential benefits of this holistic feedback approach with video based self-reflection and peer discussion with students engaging at a deeper cognitive level than the standard descriptive feedback.","2017-09-29","2021-02-11 04:12:19","2021-02-11 04:12:19","","","","","17","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 236 GRAYS INN RD, FLOOR 6, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND Publisher: BIOMED CENTRAL LTD Type: Article","","","","","Feedback; Holistic; Peer discussion; Self-reflection; Teacher guidance; Undergraduate; Video","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Curricula tend to attach the greatest value to intellectual forms of learning. However, compared with intellectual learning, experiential learning affords students deep insights about a condition. Doctors who experience ill health are more empathic towards patients. However, opportunities to learn about cancer experientially are limited. Temporary transfer tattoos can simulate the ill health associated with melanoma. We reasoned that if doctors who have been sick are more empathic temporarily `having' melanoma might have a similar effect. Objectives To explore the impact of wearing a melanoma tattoo on medical students' understanding of patienthood and attitudes towards patients with melanoma. Methods Ten fourth-year medical students were recruited to a simulation. They wore a melanoma tattoo for 24h and listened to a patient's account of receiving their diagnosis. Data were captured using audio diaries and face-to-face interviews, transcribed and analysed phenomenologically using the template analysis method. Results There were four themes: (i) melanoma simulation: opening up new experiences; (ii) drawing upon past experiences; (iii) a transformative introduction to patienthood; (iv) doctors in the making: seeing cancer patients in a new light. Conclusions By means of a novel simulation, medical students were introduced to lived experiences of having a melanoma. Such an inexpensive simulation can prompt students to reflect critically on the empathetic care of such patients in the future.","2017-09","2021-02-11 04:12:19","2021-02-11 04:12:19","","771-778","","3","177","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, the following three aspects of market sense-making in design practice are identified: (a) curiosity catalyses empathy and the deep understanding of markets, which are seen as socially constructed of individual (value-in-use) and connected (value-in-context) experiences; (b) creativity catalyses logical leaps' with regard to understanding the opportunities for creating future markets; and (c) courage catalyses learning through iterations, which reduce cognitive bias with regard to market assumptions, thereby reducing cognitive bias in both curiosity- and creativity-driven activities.","2017-03","2021-02-11 04:12:19","2021-02-11 04:12:19","","280-291","","3-4","33","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND Publisher: ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD Type: Editorial Material","","","","","creativity; courage; curiosity; Design practice; market innovation; SDL; service theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of this approach to intelligence pedagogy is to get participants to think through and work out analytic methods, issues, and potential solutions from first principles and for themselves. Our strategy is to try and fuse training and education learning outcomes, so that students emerge with a technical competence in analytic methods, underpinned by a deeper understanding of the foundations and internal logic shaping those methods. The Iraq Matrix exercise seeks to unpack and examine the nuts and bolts of source evaluation, and to test alternative hypotheses with particular attention to the relationship between the quality of various sources and, the weight of judgements they can or cannot sustain. The ultimate goal is to encourage what is currently fashionably referred to as `reflexive practice', whereby the practitioner reflects critically and self-critically upon how their task works and how they do it, then uses those insights to improve their workplace performance. But not all of our teaching is directed towards practitioners. For those whose aims are scholarly and academic, the aim is to give observers a more visceral understanding of the challenges of the intelligence task they intended to study. Here the intended reflexive practice goal is to encourage an empathy with the workaday challenges facing those in the business of intelligence analysis, and to discourage the observer's temptation to make facile and simplistic judgements about processes or events.","2017","2021-02-11 04:12:21","2021-02-11 04:12:21","","905-919","","7, SI","32","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND Publisher: ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A patient's visit is not chance but a search for a cure, amelioration of state, advice, guidance, a prescription, or for seeking reassurance, comfort, and in some circumstances, permission to “be well”. From the simplest tale to the most complex, narratives abound. Sometimes, the most intimate information shared with the physician confidante, go dark and deep, with a yearning to “tell all” after a period of suppression. Successful communication and rapport also depends on the carer's response, the degree of concentration, listening skills, body language, eye contact engagement, the patient relationship and empathy. How do we as physicians cope with emotion on both sides when it comes to listening to a narrated story, keeping matters in perspective, recognizing the effects of depression, grieving, anger, forgiveness, or the strength of the patient to be able to face their demons when cowardly acts of abuse have been committed. The professionalism of doctors should always be at the highest level, but individuals vary in their responses. A price may be paid with arising stress, unsolved patient problems, an increase in new ones, and the general challenge of coping. Time may not be the only enemy with modern day medical practice. Does narrative medicine have a place in reducing this dissonance, and will learning to share stories, as well as being a good listener, limit adverse outcomes?","2017","2021-02-11 04:12:21","2021-02-11 04:12:21","","S556-S558","","3","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: VLASKA 69, HR-10000 ZAGREB, CROATIA Publisher: MEDICINSKA NAKLADA Type: Article; Proceedings Paper","<p>6th Biennial Cambridge International Conference on Mental Health, Univ Cambridge, Clare Coll, Cambridge, ENGLAND, SEP 20-22, 2017</p>","","","","communication; empathy; body language; professionalism; carer's response; concentration; doctors; eye contact engagement; listening skills; narrative medicine; rapport; the patient relationship","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The application of Reflective Pedagogy, which sets out a learning cycle from context understanding to evaluation, and the employment of student-focused topics allow a more holistic learning process to take place. Giving students more opportunity to experience a full cycle of learning from planning to performance results in a deeper level of learning. Furthermore, trusting students with the responsibility in the conduct of their learning course, provided with appropriate approach and structured monitoring, leads to a more thorough development. Utilizing self-evaluation and peer-evaluation rubrics is a way to sharpen the students' cognitive awareness, whereas self-reflection and peer-feedback forms enable them to develop their conscience by exercising their empathy towards themselves and others as well as to reinforce their compassion by accepting and giving assistance to their peers. Furthermore, a recorded speech performance enables students to reflect and evaluate themselves and become essential to raise the students' awareness of their strengths and needs. This collaboration allows them to develop their competence, conscience, and compassion in their own pace.","2017","2021-02-11 04:12:21","2021-02-11 04:12:21","","121-125","","","110","","","","Advances in Social Science Education and Humanities Research","","","","ATLANTIS PRESS","29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE","English","","","","","","","ISSN: 2352-5398 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>5th International Seminar on English Language and Teaching (ISELT), Univ Negeri Padang, Fac Languages &amp; Arts, English Dept, Padang., INDONESIA, MAY 09-10, 2017</p>","","","","compassion; competence; conscience; Reflective pedagogy","Rozimela, Y and Fatimah, S and Amri, Z and Anwar, D and Refnaldi and Ardi, H and Arianto, MA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

How to express passions appropriately is an issue worthy of discussion. This essay begins with the discussion and the analysis on why a person can be disturbed and hurt by passions when expressing them. Firstly, the essay is to clarify the word root of “passion”, including the relations among nature, passion, and desire as well as the principle of expressing passions by enumerating “what one dislikes/” and “refraining from doing it unto others/” as examples. Secondly, the essay is to talk about “the way of empathy in moderation” when expressing passions, a way which includes sincerity (be loyal to oneself) and faithfulness (be compassionate to others). Thirdly, the essay proposes the importance of “habit” in expressing passions: “knowing” and “thinking” is indispensible to one's acquisition of “habit” in learning “the way of empathy in moderation”; one has to “assimilate oneself into nature” and cultivates the habit of expressing “the way of empathy in moderation”. Finally, this essay is to affirm the viewpoint presented in “Nature Emerges from Life” in the Guodian Chu Slips, “One must temper passion with reason before expressing or receiving it, and then it should be seasoned with ritual.” This viewpoint provides us with a model of “passion to be stressed and to be well expressed” and with a humanistic value on the humanistic way of “passion deep and ritual clear”.","2017-01","2021-02-11 04:12:22","2021-02-11 04:12:22","","71-86","","1","44","","","","","","","","","","Chinese","","","","","","","Place: 106 NO 96 LE-LI RD, DA AN DISTRICT, TAIPEI, 10668, TAIWAN Publisher: UNIVERSITAS Type: Article","","","","","Expressing Passions; Faithfulness (Be Compassionate to Others); Habit; Sincerity (Be Loyal to Oneself); The Way of Empathy in Moderation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Students were subjected to in-course policies that gave preferential status and enhanced opportunities to some classmates while others were punished or handicapped. Each of the seemingly arbitrary conditions has parallels in U.S. legal, economic, and social systems. The experiment was designed to enhance student learning through an immersion in a simulated policy environment and to offer a personalized experience of dealing with unjust and arbitrary policies. Experimental and control group responses were analyzed with a grounded research approach. The authors found that the immersive environment led to deeper knowledge of the policy situation and an understanding of how to get involved in a policy area to effect change.

In order to investigate the roots of pro-sociality in mammals, we established the helping behavior test, a paradigm in which rats are faced with a conspecific trapped in a restrainer that can only be opened from the outside. Over the course of repeated test sessions, rats exposed to a trapped cagemate learn to open the door to the restrainer, thereby helping the trapped rat to escape (Ben-Ami Bartal et al., 2011). The discovery of this natural behavior provides a unique opportunity to probe the motivation of rodent helping behavior, leading to a deeper understanding of biological influences on human pro-sociality. To determine if an affective response motivates door-opening, rats receiving midazolam, a benzodiazepine anxiolytic, were tested in the helping behavior test. Midazolam-treated rats showed less helping behavior than saline-treated rats or rats receiving no injection. Yet, midazolam-treated rats opened a restrainer containing chocolate, highlighting the socially specific effects of the anxiolytic. To determine if midazolam interferes with helping through a sympatholytic effect, the peripherally restricted beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist nadolol was administered; nadolol did not interfere with helping. The corticosterone response of rats exposed to a trapped cagemate was measured and compared to the rats' subsequent helping behavior. Rats with the greatest corticosterone responses showed the least helping behavior and those with the smallest responses showed the most consistent helping at the shortest latency. These results are discussed in terms of their implications for the interaction between stress and pro-social behavior. Finally, we observed that door-opening appeared to be reinforcing. A novel analytical tool was designed to interrogate the pattern of door-opening for signs that a rat's behavior on one session influenced his behavior on the next session. Results suggest that helping a trapped rat has a greater motivational value than does chocolate. In sum, this series of experiments clearly demonstrates the fundamental role of affect in motivating pro-social behavior in rodents and the need for a helper to resonate with the affect of a victim.","2016-06-08","2021-02-11 04:12:23","2021-02-11 04:12:23","","","","","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND Publisher: FRONTIERS MEDIA SA Type: Article","","","","","empathy; altruism; emotional contagion; helping; midazolam; rodent","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Service learning has been shown to help physicians in training rediscover the altruistic reasons for pursuing medicine and has the potential to enhance students' perspectives of humanism in medicine. The Kalaupapa service learning project is a unique collaboration between disadvantaged post-baccalaureate students with an underserved rural community. This study was conducted to determine whether the Kalaupapa service learning curricula enhanced student perspectives of humanism in medicine at an early stage of their medical training. Method: Program participants between 2008 and 2014 (n = 41) completed written reflections following the conclusion of the service learning project. Four prompts guided student responses. Reflections were thematically analyzed. Once all essays were read, team members compared their findings to condense or expand themes and assess levels of agreement. Results: Emerging themes of resilience and unity were prominent throughout the student reflections. Students expressed respect and empathy for the patients' struggles and strengths, as well as those of their peers. The experience also reinforced students' commitment to service, particularly to populations in rural and underserved communities. Students also gained a deeper understanding of the patient experience and also of themselves as future physicians. Conclusion: To identify and address underserved and rural patients' health care needs, training programs must prepare an altruistic health care workforce that embraces the humanistic element of medicine. The Kalaupapa service learning project is a potential curricular model that can be used to enhance students' awareness and perspectives of humanism in medicine.","2016-05-09","2021-02-11 04:12:23","2021-02-11 04:12:23","","","","","16","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 236 GRAYS INN RD, FLOOR 6, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND Publisher: BIOMED CENTRAL LTD Type: Article","","","","","Diversity; Service-learning; Healthcare workforce; Humanism; Native Hawaiian","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The objectives of this study were to (1) analyze the satisfaction of medical students with medical humanities problem-based learning (PBL) classes facilitated by nonmedical teaching assistants (TAF) majored in the liberal arts, and those facilitated by the attending physicians (APF) and (2) examine the satisfaction of medical students with clinical medicine-related and clinical medicine-unrelated medical humanities PBL classes. A total of 123 medical students, randomly assigned to 16 groups, participated in this study. There were 16 classes in the course: 8 of them were TAF classes; and the others were APF classes. Each week, each group rotated from 1 subject of the 16 subjects of PBL to another subject. All of the 16 groups went through all the 16 subjects in the 2013 spring semester. We examined the medical students' satisfaction with each class, based on a rating score collected after each class was completed, using a scale from 0 (the lowest satisfaction) to 100 (the highest satisfaction). We also conducted multivariate linear regression analysis to examine the association between the independent variables and the students' satisfaction. Medical students were more satisfied with the TAF (91.35 +/- 7.75) medical humanities PBL classes than APF (90.40 +/- 8.42) medical humanities PBL classes (P = 0.01). Moreover, medical students were more satisfied with the clinical medicine-unrelated topics (92.00 +/- 7.10) than the clinical medicine-related topics (90.36 +/- 7.99) in the medical humanities PBL course (P = 0.01). This medical humanities PBL course, including nonmedical subjects and topics, and nonmedical teaching assistants from the liberal arts as class facilitators, was satisfactory. This pedagogical approach of student-centered, nonmedical topics, nonmedical facilitators, and small groups, which is associated with a deep approach to learning medical humanities, should be highly encouraged.","2016-02","2021-02-11 04:12:23","2021-02-11 04:12:23","","1-6","","6","95","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA Publisher: LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We examined whether information about other people's pain reports affected both participants' pain experience and skin conductance responses (SCR) during pain. Sixty volunteers experienced painful heat stimulation preceded by 2 kinds of informational cues: (a) nonreinforced social information indicating low or high pain ratings from previous participants; and (b) reinforced conditioned stimuli (CSlow, Cs-high). Both high-pain social information and CShigh cues enhanced pain and SCRs relative to their respective controls, with particularly robust effects of social information. Effects of both manipulations on both pain and SCRs were mediated by trial-by-trial pain expectancies. These results demonstrate strong social influences on pain and autonomic responses, and suggest that expectations from multiple sources can influence pain physiology independent of reinforcement.","2016-02","2021-02-11 04:12:24","2021-02-11 04:12:24","","24-32","","1","16","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA Publisher: AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC Type: Article","","","","","learning; heat pain; personality; placebo; social influence","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

First, we train a recurrent neural network mapping the text of each speaker turn to a set of task-specific behavioral acts that represent local dynamics of the client-counselor interaction. Subsequently, this network is used to initialize lower layers of a deep network predicting session level counselor empathy rating.

During the research, a six-stage qualitative survey design was proposed, and a letter questionnaire was applied as a free writing instrument and sent to second-year bachelor students of the Faculty of Management at The University of Gdansk, Poland. To identify the most preferred characteristics, a content analysis and Pareto analysis were used. As a result, 32 characteristics were proposed and grouped into 5 categories, namely tangibles (T), reliability (Rel), responsiveness (Res), assurance (A) and empathy (E). Based on this, several proposals and recommendations for the future were specified.

However, selection in a great number of medical schools worldwide is still based on knowledge exams, a procedure that might neglect students with needed personal characteristics for future medical practice. We investigated whether the personal profile of students selected through a knowledge-based exam differed from those not selected. Methods: Students applying for medical school (N = 311) completed questionnaires assessing motivations for becoming a doctor, learning approaches, personality traits, empathy, and coping styles. Selection was based on the results of MCQ tests. Principal component analysis was used to draw a profile of the students. Differences between selected and non-selected students were examined by Multivariate ANOVAs, and their impact on selection by logistic regression analysis. Results: Students demonstrating a profile of diligence with higher conscientiousness, deep learning approach, and task-focused coping were more frequently selected (p = 0.01). Other personal characteristics such as motivation, sociability, and empathy did not significantly differ, comparing selected and non-selected students. Conclusion: Selection through a knowledge-based exam privileged diligent students.

The deep motive and strategy were more positively related with the systemizing than the empathizing, while the latter was more negatively correlated with the surface strategy. Our study suggests that while students with high systemizing are more motivated to learn science the ability to empathize is also important for successful science study.","2015-10","2021-02-11 04:12:26","2021-02-11 04:12:26","","1141-1149","","5","11","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: GAZI UNIV, GAZI EGTIM FAKULTESI, K BLOK 210, TEKNIKOKULLAR, ANKARA, 06500, TURKEY Publisher: EURASIA Type: Article","","","","","approaches to learning science; conceptions of learning science; empathizing brain type; systemizing brain type","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The EIT is a unified transpersonal theory of hypnosis and the self, which weaves together empathic elements of Dzogchen, neodissociative, neuroscience, psychoanalytic, sociocognitive, and other theories by proposing that hypnotic phenomena are inherently characterized by their deep involvement with processes of empathy and the self. The EIT proposes that the experience of hypnosis is embodied in a system of neural networks in the brain that utilizes empathy-related processes, adaptive resonance between perceptual input and top-down expectancies, and connectionist learning algorithms to (a) empathically enact the affect, cognition, body language, response expectancies, social roles, sensations, etc. that are presented to them during hypnosis in accordance with socio-cognitive theories of hypnosis; (b) engage in a convergent psychophysiological relationship with another person in accordance with psychoanalytic, Ericksonian, and polyvagal/social engagement system theories; (c) alter the empathic self/other (theory of mind) coding of phenomenological experiences during hypnosis in accordance with aspects of the neo-dissociative and socio-cognitive traditions; and (d) develop an experiential understanding of the illusion of self that may lead, in some people, to its transcendence in accordance with Bon-Buddhist, Dzogchen, and transpersonal scholars. A unified definition of hypnosis is proposed based on findings in the empathic neuroscience of hypnosis as well as a working model of the neuromatrix of the self.","2015-07-03","2021-02-11 04:12:27","2021-02-11 04:12:27","","330-348","","3, SI","57","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND Publisher: ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD Type: Article","","","","","self; empathy; neuroscience; consciousness; Dzogchen; hypnosis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The model deepens children's higher order cognitive skills as they address complex dilemmas. This paper examines the potential for COI to deepen children's moral and intellectual understanding through recursive discourse that encourages them to transcend traditional and cultural limitations, confront their own moral predispositions, and increase inter-cultural understanding. As children become familiar with normative values couched in ethical dialogue, they are immersed in ideals of reciprocity and empathy in ways that transcend narrow self-interest. The technique plays upon children's freedom of thought and freedom of conscience as they learn to express their views and to listen to the perspectives of others. COI is a functional practice enhancing a deep and practical education of character. Such dialogues can become effective vehicles for introducing children to discussions of human dignity and rights that also challenge traditional power relationships between adults and children. The uncritical assumption underlying such power differentials often contests the de facto rights and dignity of children. COI is a valuable tool for human rights education as it encourages children's sensitivity to the rights and dignities of others and, simultaneously, honors children's own rights and dignities as participating citizens in the global community.","2015-12","2021-02-11 04:12:27","2021-02-11 04:12:27","","319-328","","22","11","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: NEFI-CENTER PHILOSOPHICAL & CHILDHOOD STUDIES, RIO DE JANEIRO, 00000, BRAZIL Publisher: STATE UNIV RIO DE JANEIRO Type: Article","","","","","Community of Inquiry; Ethnocentrism; Human Rights Education; Inter-cultural Education; Philosophy for Children","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper presents a cycle from a critically reflexive action research co-inquiry that explored the tensions and possibilities of nurses' reflecting during care-giving where poems emerged as data. These poems were inspired by reflections, observations, co-inquirers' stories and interviews. They formed part of a first-, second- and third-person co-inquiry. Applying Bourdieu's concepts of doxa, habitus and field to the poems revealed cultural aspects of nursing practice. The poems resonated with nurses' experiences producing deeper conversations and powerful reflexive co-inquiries about practice. The poems evoked suppressed emotions and empathy. I argue poems derived from practice are embodied knowledge and thus have a legitimate place in healthcare action research. Practice-based poems could be valuable for other practice-orientated professions in producing practice learning and change.","2015-03","2021-02-11 04:12:27","2021-02-11 04:12:27","","30-47","","1, SI","13","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND Publisher: SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD Type: Article","","","","","emotions; co-inquiry; collaborative action research; embodied knowledge; emotional labour; habitus and field; Poetry; reflexive","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"Y34SC9XN","journalArticle","2015","Koopman, Eva Maria (Emy); Hakemulder, Frank","Effects of Literature on Empathy and Self-Reflection: A Theoretical-Empirical Framework","JOURNAL OF LITERARY THEORY","","1862-5290","10.1515/jlt-2015-0005","","Various scholars have made claims about literature's potential to evoke empathy and self-reflection, which would eventually lead to more pro-social behavior. But is it indeed the case that a seemingly idle pass-time activity like literary reading can do all that? And if so, how can we explain such an influence? Would the effects be particular to unique literary text qualities or to other aspects that literary texts share with other genres (e.g., narrativity)? Empirical research is necessary to answer these questions. This article presents an overview of empirical studies investigating the relationship between reading and empathy, and reading and self-reflection. We reveal those questions in the research that are not addressed as of yet, and synthesize the available approaches to literary effects. Based on theory as well as empirical work, a multi-factor model of literary reading is constructed. With regard to reading and empathy, the metaphor of the moral laboratory (cf. Hakemulder 2000) comes close to a concise summary of the research and theory. Being absorbed in a narrative can stimulate empathic imagination. Readers go along with the author/narrator in a (fictional) thought-experiment, imagining how it would be to be in the shoes of a particular character, with certain motives, under certain circumstances, meeting with certain events. That would explain why narrativity can result in a broadening of readers' consciousness, in particular so that it encompasses fellow human beings. Fictionality might stimulate readers to consider the narrative they read as a thought experiment, creating distance between them and the events, allowing them to experiment more freely with taking the position of a character different from themselves, also in moral respects. Literary features, like gaps and ambiguous characterization, may stimulate readers to make more mental inferences, thus training their theory of mind. However, apart from literature possibly being able to train basic cognitive ability, we have little indication for the importance of literary imagination over narrative or fictional imagination. Regarding self-reflection, while there is no convincing evidence that literary texts are generally more thought-provoking than non-literary texts (either narrative or expository), there is tentative indication for a relation between reading literary texts and self-reflection. However, as was the case for the studies on empathy, there is a lack of systematic comparisons between literary narratives and non-literary narratives. There are some suggestions regarding the processes that can lead to self-reflection. Empirical and theoretical work indicates that the combination of experiencing narrative and aesthetic emotions tends to trigger self-reflection. Personal and reading experience may influence narrative and aesthetic emotions. By proposing a multi-factor model of literary reading, we hope to give an impulse to current reader response research, which too often conflates narrativity, fictionality and literariness. The multi-factor model of literary reading contains (our simplified versions of) two theoretical positions within the field of reader response studies on underlying processes that lead to empathy and reflection: the idea of reading literature as a form of role-taking proposed by Oatley (e.g., 1994; 1999) and the idea of defamiliarization through deviating textual and narrative features proposed by Miall and Kuiken (1994; 1999). We argue that these positions are in fact complementary. While the role-taking concept seems most adequate to explain empathic responses, the defamiliarization concept seems most adequate in explaining reflective responses. The discussion of these two theoretical explanations leads to the construction of a theoretical framework (and model) that offers useful suggestions which texts could be considered to have which effects on empathy and reflection. In our multi-factor model of literary reading, an important addition to the previously mentioned theories is the concept “stillness”. We borrow this term from the Canadian author Yann Martel (2009), who suggests reading certain literary texts will help to stimulate self-contemplation (and appreciation for art), moments that are especially valuable in times that life seems to be racing by, and we are enveloped by work and a multitude of other activities. Other literary authors have proposed similar ideas. Stillness is related to, or overlaps with the more commonly used term “aesthetic distance”, an attitude of detachment, allowing for contemplation to take place (cf. Cupchik 2001). Stillness, we propose, allows a space in which slow thinking (Kahneman 2011) can take place. Stillness is not reflection itself, but a precondition for reflection. In our model, stillness is an empty space or time that is created as a result of reading processes: the slowing down of readers' perceptions of the fictional world, caused by defamiliarization. Our multi-factor model suggests that while role-taking can take place for all types of narratives, literary and fictional narratives may evoke the type of aesthetic distance (stillness) that leads to a suspension of judgment, adding to a stronger experience of role-taking and narrative empathy. In a time when the biggest bestsellers are about crime and erotic sadomasochism, the idea that reading literature can make us better human beings may seem farfetched. However, ever since Aristotle's Poetics (1987; orig. around 335 BCE), authors, critics, and academics have made claims concerning the ethical potential of narrative drama and poetic language (e.g., Althusser 1983; Booth 1988; Boyd 2009; Bronzwaer 1986; De Botton 1997; Habermas 1983; Hunt 2007; Nussbaum 1995; 1997; 2001; 2010; Pinker 2011; Sontag 2007; Van Peer 1995). The general claims are that reading literature may enhance self-knowledge, make people more aware of the plights of those suffering, and more willing to take action to help them. In recent years, the philosopher Martha Nussbaum has defended the ethical power of literature most ardently. Reading literature, she says, triggers a type of imagination that is “an essential ingredient of an ethical stance that asks us to concern ourselves with the good of other people whose lives are distant from our own” (1995, xvi). Through this “literary imagination”, readers learn to put themselves in the place of people they could not have known that intimately in any other way, thus deepening their understanding and compassion. As Nussbaum (2001, 2) further argues, literary texts can lead to the sort of “self-examination” that is crucial to ethical decision-making. Often this is reflection on the self, in relation to others. Knowing how we might respond to certain situations might help us understand how others would feel as well (cf. Johnson's 1993 conception of “moral imagination”, and extensive use of the term elsewhere, e.g., Beran 1998; Guroian 1996; Hutchison 2004). These are just a few of the reasons why empathy and self-reflection make an interesting couple to focus on when studying the effects of reading literary texts. To various scholars, the claims about the relevance of this duo and their relation with literary imagination are far-reaching rather than farfetched. Hunt (2007), for instance, proposes that fiction has contributed to a mindset that enabled people to think up a concept like human rights. Novels such as Rousseau's Julie (1761) and Richardson's Pamela (1740) stimulated readers, she says, to empathize across borders of class, sex, and nation. “As a consequence”, Hunt claims, “they came to see others - people they did not know personally - as like them, as having the same kinds of inner emotions. Without this learning process, `equality' could have no deep meaning and in particular no political consequence” (ibid., 40). She illustrates her statements with examples of responses of contemporary readers. Pinker (2011) takes this line of argument even further, suggesting that the spectacular increase in availability and consumption of narratives in our history might have caused an increase in empathic ability and, subsequently, a decline in violence. The relevance of literature's effect on self-reflection is maybe less self-evident, but that does not make the claims less sweeping. Among others, Althusser (1980), Habermas (1983), and Bronzwaer (1986) have argued that literature's polyvalence can lead us to reflect on our own norms, values, and prejudices, and that this would ultimately benefit society. Indeed, awareness of self and others may be key to our happiness, social success (Cooper/Sawaf 2003; Goleman 1995), and even productivity (Ibarra/Barbulescu 2010, see Bal/Veltkamp 2013). But is it indeed the case that a seemingly idle pass-time activity like literary reading can do all that? And if so, how can we explain such an influence? Would the effects be particular to unique literary text qualities or to other aspects that literary texts share with other genres (e.g., narrativity)? The purpose of this article is to construct a model for such effects of literary narratives. It will reveal those questions in the research that are not addressed as of yet, and will synthesize the available approaches to literary effects. In our attempt to construct an explanatory model for literary imagination, we first evaluate the empirical indications that reading literature affects empathy in its various forms (Section 2.1). We will see that it remains unclear how such effects come about, but that recent studies help us to make some significant progress in understanding the workings of literary imagination (Section 2.2). In Section 3 we will do the same for reflection. Finally, we will synthesize our findings in our explanatory model in Section 4. We will make use of earlier overviews (Hake-mulder 2000; Keen 2007; Kimmel 1970; Klemenz-Belgardt 1981; Mar/Oatley/ Djikic/Mullin 2011), adding other and more recent empirical work that will help us to build a synthetic framework for future research. Yet, before all this, we need to define the key terms (Section 1).","2015-03","2021-02-11 04:12:27","2021-02-11 04:12:27","","79-111","","1","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY Publisher: WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The context for this argument is a program that pairs undergraduate students and faculty members in semester-long partnerships to explore and revise pedagogical practices. Purpose: The purpose of this article is to explore how dialogue across differences supported by a student-faculty partnership program can inspire greater openness to and appreciation of differences. The focus is on fostering deeper connection and empathy across student and faculty positions, perspectives, and cultural identities. Research Design: Through systematically documented reflective practice, I draw on audio-recorded conversations, mid-and end-of-semester feedback, and follow-up interviews with student and faculty participants in the program, as well as on my own reflective notes and less formal communication with participants, to identify the ways in which these faculty and students conceptualize differences as resources for learning. Findings: Through supporting the demanding work of communicating and collaborating across differences, this program makes it normative for differences to exist and for people in relationships to benefit from them. The student-faculty partnerships evoke deliberate consideration of differences in position, perspective, and identity within collaborative work, which, in turn, generate ongoing critical reflection with the promise of changing higher educational practices. Conclusions/Recommendations: Higher education needs to create more opportunities for students and faculty to engage in dialogue across various kinds of difference. Suggestions are offered for how to create structures and support within which faculty and students can forge new perspectives that allow them to draw on differences as a uniting rather than a dividing force.","2015-02","2021-02-11 04:12:28","2021-02-11 04:12:28","","","","2","117","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 525 W 120TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10027 USA Publisher: TEACHERS COLL OF COLUMBIA UNIV Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design/methodology/approach - This paper takes the form of an explanatory case study where the author draws on a successful drama/oracy project in a primary school in Brisbane, Australia, to illustrate the connections between Alexander's five indicators of a dialogic classroom and the process drama in which the students participated. Findings - The application of this process drama as pedagogy for the teaching and learning of oracy has contributed positively to students' oral communication skills and intercultural awareness. In addition, parents provide positive feedback about student engagement in school and developing self-confidence because “they have something to say”. Research limitations/implications - There was no formal pre-post test for the oral communication skills on this study, instead the researchers developed a draft “oracy” checklist which deserves further interrogation and development. Practical implications - There are implications for the use of process drama as a means of creating and sustaining the dialogic classroom. Teacher professional development would be required to assist the planning and delivery of dramas that allow for the deep and complex learning evidenced in this study. Social implications - This is an ideal vehicle for assisting in the development of empathy, collaboration, emotional intelligence and intercultural understanding. Originality/value - This is an example of an extremely high-quality curriculum plan and implementation. The importance of engaging in implicit and explicit instruction of oral communication for the twenty-first century should not be underestimated. The process drama allows oral language to be foregrounded, with additional learning opportunities from a range of other learning areas, brought together in a coherent and complex model of practice.","2015","2021-02-11 04:12:29","2021-02-11 04:12:29","","303-313","","3, SI","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND Publisher: EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD Type: Article","","","","","Pedagogy; Dialogic classroom; English language arts; English teaching; Oracy; Oral language pedagogy; Process drama; Speaking and listening","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Intervention: We investigated the long-term influence of a simulated patient-based teaching intervention, integrating learning objectives in communication skills and ethics into students' attitudes and concerns regarding truth-telling. We followed two cohorts of medical students from the preclinical third year to their clinical rotations (fifth year). Open-ended responses were analysed to explore medical students' reported difficulties in breaking bad news. Context: This intervention was implemented during the last preclinical year of a problem-based medical curriculum, in collaboration between the doctor-patient communication and ethics programs. Outcome: Over time, concerns such as empathy and truthfulness shifted from a personal to a relational focus. Whereas `truthfulness' was a concern for the content of the message, `truth-telling' included concerns on how information was communicated and how realistically it was received. Truth-telling required empathy, adaptation to the patient, and appropriate management of emotions, both for the patient's welfare and for a realistic understanding of the situation. Lessons learned: Our study confirms that an intervention confronting students with a realistic situation succeeds in making them more aware of the real issues of truth-telling. Medical students deepened their reflection over time, acquiring a deeper understanding of the relational dimension of values such as truth-telling, and honing their view of empathy.","2015","2021-02-11 04:12:29","2021-02-11 04:12:29","","","","","20","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: RIPVAGEN 7, JARFALLA, SE-175 64, SWEDEN Publisher: CO-ACTION PUBLISHING Type: Article","","","","","communication skills; clinical education; ethics and humanities","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Background: Practitioners in many disciplines, including nursing, appreciate the value of narratives in making sense of experiences, challenging assumptions and enhancing learning: they enable exploration of reality from different perspectives and create an emotional resonance. Narratives help nursing students to uncover embedded meanings, values and beliefs; they can include written texts, illustrated texts or picture books. Participants: 180 students enrolled in an elective undergraduate nursing course. Method: This project afforded students the choice of critically analysing (a) a chapter from one of two autobiographies, (b) an illustrated text, or (c) an illustration from a picture book. Each text was a narrative account from a personal or carer's perspective of the experience of mental illness. Their written submissions were then analysed by means of a qualitative descriptive approach. Results: In analysis of the autobiographies students tended to paraphrase the authors' words and summarise their experiences. Those choosing the illustrated text were able to link the images and text, and provide a deeper and more insightful level of interpretation, albeit influenced by the author's personal account and expressed emotions; however, those analysing a picture book illustration demonstrated a surprising level of critical and creative thinking, and their interpretations were empathetic, insightful and thoughtful. Conclusion: The use of picture books, although not a common approach in nursing education, appears to engage students, challenge them to think more deeply, and stimulate their imagination.

Moreover high quality study requires high quality lecturing/teaching that creates an environment in which deep learning outcomes are made possible for students. The aim was to identify the characteristics of the academic teacher working at business schools, according to the expectations of Polish students from a 21st century perspective. A qualitative survey design was used in the form of a letter questionnaire. 144 second-year bachelor students of Gdansk University from the Faculty of Management were asked to list a maximum of five, most preferred characteristics, and to comment their answers. Finally, 109 students participated in the study, and 471 characteristics were proposed, analyzed and put into five categories, like: tangibles (T), reliability (Rel), responsiveness (Res), assurance (A) and empathy (E). Content analysis and Pareto-Lorenzo analysis was used and the most preferable characteristics were identified. The conclusions, proposals and recommendations were presented. The academic teacher has to be well prepared and teach in an interesting, innovative way with a use of modern techniques and methods. Very important is to apply not only the lecture-style methods but also on-the job teaching, project-based teaching, team work-based teaching, action teaching, experiential teaching, small groups teaching, case studies, simulations, e-teaching, and even volunteering teaching. Nor without the signifcance are coaching and mentoring and the features referring to the style of teaching, like charisma, creativity, passion, and engagement, which characterise good managers and business leaders.","2014","2021-02-11 04:12:31","2021-02-11 04:12:31","","431-438","","","","","","","","","","","UNIV LATVIA","19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: Univ Latvia, Fac Econ & Management; Latvian European Community Studies Assoc; Inst CEDIMES Lettonie; Econometrists Assoc Latvia; Latvian Informat & Commun Technol Assoc; Assoc Statisticians Latvia; Balt Sea Reg Univ Network; Wellton Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>International Scientific Conference on New Challenges of Economic and Business Development, Univ Latvia, Riga, LATVIA, MAY 08-10, 2014</p>","","","","academic teacher; business school; quality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper will report on the early emergence of such prejudices, identified in eight-year-old primary school children in Korea. The research, conducted in June 2012, investigated Korean children's reactions to the Japanese tsunami of 2011. A pedagogically embedded research methodology (PERM) was used, where the research initiative was embedded within the teaching and learning of a normal school lesson. The research reveals that young Korean children's prejudices are nationally and culturally deep-seated, and are reinforced by parochial viewpoints projected by Korean mass media programmes. These influences place constraints on children's ability to empathise with people beyond their national borders. Nevertheless, the project provides evidence that prejudicial attitudes remain malleable in children and can be changed in a challenging but supportive educational context.","2014","2021-02-11 04:12:31","2021-02-11 04:12:31","","282-301","","3, SI","43","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND Publisher: ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD Type: Article","","","","","education; empathy; moral development; prejudice","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The main intention is to make the learner's mind more aware of the human condition and to improve program objectives and learning through contemplative approaches. The 4 courses target in the first semester of 2012 academic year were students in Art Education Program and Teaching Japanese Program; Aesthetic Education, Art for Special-Needs Children, Introduction to Educational Philosophy and Ethics for Profession Teaching. The study was involving qualitative method, contemplative education approaches were used through mindfulness, deep listening, storytelling, sharing experiences together with dialogue, world cafe technique, drawing and reflection journaling. The results from reflective papers, observation and focus group were analyzed by content analysis. The research findings found that the contemplative teaching can support the development of attention, insight, emotional self-regulation, empathy, compassion for self and others and action in order to encourage and transform self-learning, deepens learning and builds inner strengths and skills. Through these approaches they were learning to reduce stress, enhance and improve classroom climates, and were helping students to calm their bodies and minds, focus their attention, and even open their hearts by exchange of learning ideas. The contemplative education approach is enabled students to recognize and properly tend to behavioural patterns and enabled students to process facts which led to contemplation and ultimately to wisdom.

However, role-play has limitations and typically does not involve those who hear voices. This collaborative project between mental health consumers who hear voices and nursing academics aimed to develop and assess simulated voice-hearing as an alternative learning tool that could provide a deeper understanding of the impact of voice-hearing, whilst enabling students to consider the communication skills required when interacting with voice-hearers. Simulated sounds and voices recorded by consumers on mp3 players were given to eighty final year nursing students undertaking a mental health elective. Students participated in various activities whilst listening to the simulations. Seventy-six (95%) students completed a written evaluation following the simulation, which assessed the benefits of the simulation and its implications for clinical practice. An analysis of the students' responses by an external evaluator indicated that there were three major learning outcomes: developing an understanding of voice-hearing, increasing students' awareness of its impact on functioning, and consideration of the communication skills necessary to engage with consumers who hear voices.

Objectives: To evaluate the impact of Hub and Spoke model(s) of clinical practice placement across geographically diverse locations, with a particular focus on enhancing the student practice learning experience. Design: Multiple case study design. Setting & Participants: Comprised undergraduate student nurses from Adult, Learning Disability and Mental Health programmes from 3 Scottish Schools of Nursing. Methods: A mixed methods approach which included quantitative and qualitative date tools. Results: All three Hub and Spoke models shared two broad findings: 1) In the three Hub and Spoke models detailed in this paper, there is a continuum of student led learning which supports the process with opportunities for individual students to be positively innovative and creative in their learning approaches. Depth of learning was achieved in two ways; a) the method in which Hub placements are organised, managed and structured and, b) the depth of empathy and sensitivity to the individual at the centre of the care. 2) Placement capacity is increased: The classification of placements is reviewed to produce broader categories, Engagement of mentors/enhanced student/mentor relationship. Conclusions: Practice Learning must be seen as an academic endeavour that promotes deep, meaningful, person-centred learning rather than superficial, compartmentalised placement-centred learning.

This study evaluated those claims in a large group of doctors practicing in the UK while taking into account a wide range of background variables. Methods: A follow-up questionnaire was sent to 4,457 UK-qualified doctors who had been included in four previous studies of medical school selection and training, beginning in 1980, 1985, 1990 and 1989/1991. A total of 2,845 (63.8%) doctors returned the questionnaire. Questions particularly asked about work engagement, satisfaction with medicine as a career, and personal achievement (Vocation/engagement), stress, emotional exhaustion, and depersonalization (BurnedOut), and 29 different leisure activities (Avocation/Leisure), as well as questions on personality, empathy, work experience, and demography. Results: Doctors reporting more Avocation/Leisure activities tended to be women, to have older children, to be less surface-rational, more extravert, more open to experience, less agreeable, and to fantasize more. Doctors who were more BurnedOut tended to be men, to be more sleep-deprived, to report a greater workload and less choice and independence in their work, to have higher neuroticism, lower extraversion and lower agreeableness scores, and to have lower self-esteem. In contrast, doctors with a greater sense of Vocation/engagement, tended to see more patients, to have greater choice and independence at work, to have a deep approach to work, to have a more supportive-receptive work environment, to be more extravert and more conscientious, and to report greater self-esteem. Avocation/Leisure activities correlated significantly with Vocation/engagement, even after taking into account 25 background variables describing demography, work, and personality, whereas BurnedOut showed no significant correlation with Avocation/Leisure activities. Popular Culture and High Culture did not differ in their influence on Vocation/engagement, although there was a suggestion that Depersonalization was correlated with more interest in Popular Culture and less interest in High Culture. Conclusion: In this cross-sectional study there is evidence, even after taking into account a wide range of individual difference measures, that doctors with greater Avocation/Leisure activities also have a greater sense of Vocation/Engagement. In contrast, being BurnedOut did not relate to Avocation/Leisure activities (but did relate to many other measures). Osler was probably correct in recommending to doctors that, `While medicine is to be your vocation, or calling, see to it that you also have an avocation'.","2011-08-30","2021-02-11 04:12:33","2021-02-11 04:12:33","","","","","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND Publisher: BMC Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The main aim of the simulation strategy is creating as much as possible closer situation to the real life or the pupils' life experience. Through this strategy the pupils learn certain principles, skills of understanding and cognitive thinking, psychomotor skills and values/ ways of behavior, connected with certain certification, influences, readiness, alertness and empathy. The aim of this research is directed to assessment of the influence of the simulation strategy over the improvement of the classroom climate. From the actions, in this research were used observant field notes, that enabled an insight of the event through direct listening and looking by the pupils, and conceptual field notes that enabled making conclusions from the observation. From the instruments for registering the data was used a protocol for observation, aimed to the students, the pupils were observed during the classes and during the break. Another instrument that was used for the research is the questionnaire, aimed to the teachers and the experts. The use of the simulation strategy has a great influence over the creation of a positive climate in the class that it isn't limited only in the process of classes realization, but it has broader and deeper dimension. It influences the positive dimension of the pupil's personality too as well as the development and straightening of the educational function of the school. That is why; in the future the teachers should continue to use this strategy and to specialize in this field so they can qualify the present and the future generations, in a quicker and easier way to solve the problems on personal, interpersonal, local and global level.

It seemed to have appropriated some of the key issues of the genre discourse - the question of what constitutes humanity, of the possibility of coexistence between humans and AI, of the problems of morality and consent. It also made use of time-honored devices of alternative history without treating it too seriously. Instead, the characters are enmeshed in personal problems and conundrums of science and politics, justice and empathy - and love. McEwan's commentary on the novel in various interviews only aggravated the critics who were all too ready to conclude that Machines Like Me offered little originality. This essay will demonstrate that the text is carefully layered as if to protect its own novelty hidden beneath rather conventional love triangle plot, ponderous political commentary, and genre-specific topicality. It will be an effort to understand the complex relation between the writer and conventions which come into play in his novel, and it will proceed to read the text against the authorial comments, finding suppressed hints that invite an interpretation of the text as narrated by its android hero rather than human subject.","","2021-02-11 04:13:19","2021-02-11 04:13:19","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND Publisher: ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD Type: Article; Early Access","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Dick'sDo androids dream of electric sheep?","NEOHELICON","","0324-4652","10.1007/s11059-020-00544-z","","The official definition for alexithymia dates back to 1973, when Sifneos described its symptoms. Persons affected by this condition are unable to verbally describe their feelings. For many years this condition was relatively little known, but nowadays people are talking about it more and more. In forums in which the patients' comments are posted, it is often underscored how this particular mental state is similar to that of the androids described in the novelDo androids dream of electric sheep? by Philip K. Dick. The Dickian clinical references were those in use during the 1960s. Therefore, to special characteristics that Philip Dick attributed to his robots (coldness and lack of human empathy, and simultaneous desire for social acceptance), the writer, and then the critics, assigned the label of schizophrenia, the only one that the psychiatric manuals of that time associated to such symptoms. Today, if Dick were alive and were to write about his androids, he most likely would no longer use the term schizophrenics, but instead the term alexithymics, which are more socially adaptive than schizophrenics, just like his androids. Making retrospective diagnoses of literary characters is anachronistic; as it was done for decades by critics to consider the Dickian androids schizophrenics: in the fiction story they are not schizophrenics but robots. However a new psychological trait such as alexithymia can revisit that same story by giving it a new symbolic meaning. The aims of this article are: to highlight how the old nosological categories of schizophrenia, generally referred to when commentingDo androids dream of electric sheep?, should be supplemented by the category of alexithymia; to analyze the scenes in which the characters have typical alexithymic behaviors, trying to prove that alexithymia is actually best suited for describing the androids invented by Dick.","2020-12","2021-02-11 04:13:19","2021-02-11 04:13:19","","673-683","","2, SI","47","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article","","","","","Schizophrenia; Affective disorders; Alexithymia; Dick; Do androids dream of electric sheep?; Philip K","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The empirical understanding of the drivers of visitors' intentions to use robots in such services has become an urgent necessity for their sustainable deployment. Certainly, using social androids within hospitality services requires organisations' attentive commitment to value creation and fulfilling service quality expectations. In this paper, via structural equation modelling (SEM) and semi-structured interviews with managers, we conceptualise and empirically test visitors' intentions to use social robots in hospitality services. With data collected in Singapore's hospitality settings, we found visitors' intentions to use social robots stem from the effects of technology acceptance variables, service quality dimensions leading to perceived value, and two further dimensions from human robot interaction (HRI): empathy and information sharing. Analysis of these dimensions' importance provides a deeper understanding of novel opportunities managers may take advantage of to position social robot-delivered services in tourism and hospitality strategies.","2020-06","2021-02-11 04:13:20","2021-02-11 04:13:20","","","","","78","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND Publisher: ELSEVIER SCI LTD Type: Article","","","","","Artificial intelligence; Human-robot interaction; Hospitality services; Intention to use robots; Social robots","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One of the reasons for its increasing growth is the structural/market-level factors (known as media factors). Although India is a growing technology hub, there have been limited efforts to identify the media multitasking behaviour among the youth in this country. Thus, this study attempts to analyse the prevalence of media multitasking behaviour among the Indian college students and its relationship with their emotions through two methods: self-report and an android-based application known as `Affective Media Landscape Survey' (AMLS). Previous studies have reported that continuous interaction with media diminishes face-to-face interaction, reduces empathy and increases the tendency to live in the virtual world. This raises the concern for emotional differences in everyday life, if any, between the high and low groups of media multitaskers. So the second objective of the study is to understand the emotional profile of the users that varies among media multitasking index. To achieve these objectives, the same two methods, the `self-report' that involves questionnaires and AMLS (an android-based app to study the frequency of media multitasking behaviour and the emotions of the users) have been employed. The study gives an insight into the emerging behavioural patterns and hence is helpful for designing communities to cater to the growing needs of the young media users.","2018-11","2021-02-11 04:13:20","2021-02-11 04:13:20","","197-211","","3","13","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 2455 ℡LER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA Publisher: SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC Type: Article","","","","","emotions; Affective media landscape survey; media factors; media multitasking index","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Dick's empathy box from his novel Do Androids Dream of Electronic Sheep? [3]. In the novel, thousands of people were anonymously connected with each other both haptically and emotionally when they grabbed the handles of their empathy boxes. The Empathy Amulet similarly networks a group of strangers together through shared experiences of physical warmth. It is not yet another technology for staying in touch with people you already know (and falling short). Rather, it encourages its wearer to make a deliberate and generous choice to invest their time and energy in connection with strangers, and it incorporates reciprocity into its design, such that helping oneself means helping other people. In today's world, people are less likely to feel empathy towards those not in their immediate network of family and friends, and, despite a proliferation of connective technologies, loneliness is on the rise [2, 5]. Surprisingly, it is the perceived sense of loneliness, and not actually being physically alone that has numerous health consequences for a significant portion of the population. Lakoff and Johnson's theory of embodied mind asserts that our physical and subjective experiences are inextricably linked, and the Empathy Amulet leverages the powerful connection between the physical experience of warmth and the subjective experience of social connectedness to combat loneliness and cultivate a stronger sense of connection with strangers [1, 4].","2018","2021-02-11 04:13:20","2021-02-11 04:13:20","","248-253","","","","","","","","","","","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: Assoc Comp Machinery; ACM SIGCHI; ACM SIGMOBILE; NOKIA Bell Labs; Intel; Microsoft; NAVER Lab; HUAWEI; Singapore Tourism Board; SG Singapore Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>ACM International Symposium on Wearable Computers, Google, Singapore, SINGAPORE, OCT 08-12, 2018</p>","","","","Embodied cognition; haptic I/O; internet of things; prototyping; wearable electronics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DICK'S “DO ANDROIDS DREAM OF ELECTRIC SHEEP?”","NOVYI FILOLOGICHESKII VESTNIK-NEW PHILOLOGICAL BULLETIN","","2072-9316","","","Written in 1968, the sci-fi novel by the American author Philip K. Dick “Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?” still retains the interest of the wide reading audience. The paper aims at elaborating upon the reasons for this lasting public enthusiasm which is claimed to relate not only to extremely successful film-versions of the book, but, even more so, to the highly topical message of the novel. In his antiutopian text, Philip K. Dick manages to put into focus the whole range of issues curraently associated with posthumanism. These are environmental problems caused by human activities, interplanet colonization escalating the conflicts of inclusion / exclusion, human / animal relations overlapping with the hybridization of natural and artificial, critical problems of future technological posthumanism manifesting themselves in highly problematic distinction between the humans and androids and in questioning the ontoethical status of the humans Philip K. Dick explores philosophical and social underpinnings of the catastrophic future which lies in wait for humanity and seems to strongly adhere to such humanistic values as empathy (the main touchstone to differentiate between humans and androids), self-reflection (the predominant feature of the protagonist Rick Deckard), search for identity and for meaning as the principal vectors of the human life, mercy for the mentally handicapped. Philip K. Dick's book can be viewed as one of the earliest caveats of the emerging trend to reconsider humanness in the sociocultural context of rapidly developing technology, various environmental threats, all kinds of hybridization and their ethical repercussions - and as such can be seen as truly prognostic, the most valuable part of it to be found in its ethical and social awareness and highly conscious refusal to suggest any final answer: essentially, the titled question seems eristically unanswerable.","2018","2021-02-11 04:13:20","2021-02-11 04:13:20","","197-207","","47","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: MIUSSKAYA SQ 6, MOSCOW GSP-3, 125993, RUSSIA Publisher: RUSSIAN STATE UNIV HUMANITIES Type: Article","","","","","empathy; (post)humanism; anti-utopia; historicism; humanness; ideology; Philip K.

As people interact more often with voice and gesture controlled machines, they expect the machines to recognize different emotions, and understand other high level communication features such as humor, sarcasm and intention. In order to make such communication possible, the machines need an empathy module in them, which is a software system that can extract emotions from human speech and behavior and can decide the correct response of the robot. Although research on empathetic robots is still in the primary stage, current methods involve using signal processing techniques, sentiment analysis and machine learning algorithms to make robots that can `understand' human emotion. Other aspects of human-robot interaction include facial expression and gesture recognition, as well as robot movement to convey emotion and intent. We propose Zara the Supergirl as a prototype system of empathetic robots. It is a software-based virtual android, with an animated cartoon character to present itself on the screen. She will get `smarter' and more empathetic, by having machine learning algorithms, and gathering more data and learning from it. In this paper, we present our work so far in the areas of deep learning of emotion and sentiment recognition, as well as humor recognition. We hope to explore the future direction of android development and how it can help improve people's lives.","2018","2021-02-11 04:13:21","2021-02-11 04:13:21","","173-193","","","9624","","","","Lecture Notes in Computer Science","","","","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","English","","","","","","","ISSN: 0302-9743 Issue: II Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>17th International Conference on Intelligent Text Processing and Computational Linguistics (CICLing), Mevlana Univ, Konya, TURKEY, APR 03-09, 2016</p>","","","","","Gelbukh, A","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The behavior that would induce human-like feelings after long exposures is difficult to determine, and it often depends on the cultural background of the observers. Therefore, in this study, we generate an acting performance system for the android, in which an android and a human interact in a stage play in the real world. We adopt the theatrical theory called Contemporary Colloquial Theatre Theory to give the android natural behaviors so that audiences can comfortably observe it even after long-minute exposure. A stage play is created and shown in various locations, and the audiences are requested to report their impressions of the stage and their cultural and psychological backgrounds in a self-evaluating questionnaire. Overall analysis indicates that the audience had positive feelings, in terms of attractiveness, towards the android on the stage even after 20 min of exposure. The singularly high acceptance of the android by Japanese audiences seems to be correlated with a high animism tendency, rather than to empathy. We also discuss how the stage play approach is limited and could be extended to contribute to realization of human-robot interaction in the real world.","2017-12","2021-02-11 04:13:21","2021-02-11 04:13:21","","","","4","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND Publisher: MDPI AG Type: Article","","","","","social robots; android theatre; contemporary colloquial theatre theory; robot theatre","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the future, we may face a different but related problem: that we might create (or cause the creation of) beings that not only satisfy but exceed these criteria. The question becomes whether these are minimal criteria, or hierarchical, such that those who fulfill them to greater degree should be afforded greater consideration. This article questions the validity and necessity of drawing divisions among beings that satisfy the minimum requirements for personhood; considering how future beings-intelligent androids, synthezoids, even alternate-substrate sentiences-might fit alongside the “baseline” human. I ask whether these alternate beings ought to be considered different to us, and why this may or may not matter in terms of a notion of “human community.” The film Blade Runner, concerned in large part with humanity and its key synthezoid antagonist Roy Batty, forms a framing touchstone for my discussion. Batty is stronger, faster, more resilient, and more intelligent than Homo sapiens. His exploits, far beyond the capability of normal humans, are contrasted with his frailty and transient lifespan, his aesthetic appreciation of the sights he has seen, and his burgeoning empathy. Not for nothing does his creator within the mythos term him “more human than human.”","2017-07","2021-02-11 04:13:21","2021-02-11 04:13:21","","476-490","","3","26","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA Publisher: CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS Type: Article","","","","","artificial intelligence; enhancement; humanity; novel beings; personhood; posthuman","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The book is set in Los Angeles in a post-apocalyptic future where mankind has left Earth, resulting in androids being created to develop new `off-world' colonies. The book and film create a novel and interesting framework to discuss the subject of replicas and replication within contemporary conservation practice. Key themes are decay promoting replication, original versus replica, creating empathy in replication.

To validate our research, we have used the proposed system with the minimalistic humanoid robot Telenoid. We have conducted human-robot interactions test with elderly people with no prior interaction experience with robot. During the experiment, elderly persons engaged a stimulated conversation with the humanoid robot.

Perception of virtual characters versus humans: an affective cognitive neuroscience perspective","FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY","","1664-1078","10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00576","","Recent developments in neuroimaging research support the increased use of naturalistic stimulus material such as film, avatars, or androids. These stimuli allow for a better understanding of how the brain processes information in complex situations while maintaining experimental control. While avatars and androids are well suited to study human cognition, they should not be equated to human stimuli. For example, the uncanny valley hypothesis theorizes that artificial agents with high human-likeness may evoke feelings of eeriness in the human observer. Here we review if, when, and how the perception of human-like avatars and androids differs from the perception of humans and consider how this influences their utilization as stimulus material in social and affective neuroimaging studies. First, we discuss how the appearance of virtual characters affects perception. When stimuli are morphed across categories from non-human to human, the most ambiguous stimuli, rather than the most human-like stimuli, show prolonged classification times and increased eeriness. Human-like to human stimuli show a positive linear relationship with familiarity. Secondly, we show that expressions of emotions in human-like avatars can be perceived similarly to human emotions, with corresponding behavioral, physiological and neuronal activations, with exception of physical dissimilarities. Subsequently, we consider if and when one perceives differences in action representation by artificial agents versus humans. Motor resonance and predictive coding models may account for empirical findings, such as an interference effect on action for observed human-like, natural moving characters. However, the expansion of these models to explain more complex behavior, such as empathy, still needs to be investigated in more detail. Finally, we broaden our outlook to social interaction, where virtual reality stimuli can be utilized to imitate complex social situations.","2015-05-12","2021-02-11 04:13:22","2021-02-11 04:13:22","","","","","6","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND Publisher: FRONTIERS MEDIA SA Type: Review","","","","","fMRI; virtual reality; social interaction; uncanny valley; action perception; emotion perception; naturalistic stimuli; virtual characters","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we show that human participants spontaneously match facial expressions of an android physically present in the room with them. This mimicry occurs even though these participants find the android unsettling and are fully aware that it lacks intentionality. Interestingly, a video of that same android elicits weaker mimicry reactions, occurring only in participants who find the android “humanlike.” These findings suggest that spontaneous mimicry depends on the salience of humanlike features highlighted by face-to-face contact, emphasizing the role of presence in human-robot interaction. Further, the findings suggest that mimicry of androids can dissociate from knowledge of artificiality and experienced emotional unease. These findings have implications for theoretical debates about the mechanisms of imitation.

Are mechanisms of action processing in the human brain specifically tuned to process biological agents? Humanoid robots can perform recognizable actions, but can look and move differently from humans, and as such, can be used in experiments to address such questions. Here, we recorded EEG as participants viewed actions performed by three agents. In the Human condition, the agent had biological appearance and motion. The other two conditions featured a state-of-the-art robot in two different appearances: Android, which had biological appearance but mechanical motion, and Robot, which had mechanical appearance and motion. We explored whether sensorimotor mu (8-13 Hz) and frontal theta (4-8 Hz) activity exhibited selectivity for biological entities, in particular for whether the visual appearance and/or the motion of the observed agent was biological. Sensorimotor mu suppression has been linked to the motor simulation aspect of action processing (and the human mirror neuron system, MNS), and frontal theta to semantic and memory-related aspects. For all three agents, action observation induced significant attenuation in the power of mu oscillations, with no difference between agents. Thus, mu suppression, considered an index of MNS activity, does not appear to be selective for biological agents. Observation of the Robot resulted in greater frontal theta activity compared to the Android and the Human, whereas the latter two did not differ from each other. Frontal theta thus appears to be sensitive to visual appearance, suggesting agents that are not sufficiently biological in appearance may result in greater memory processing demands for the observer. Studies combining robotics and neuroscience such as this one can allow us to explore neural basis of action processing on the one hand, and inform the design of social robots on the other.","2013","2021-02-11 04:13:23","2021-02-11 04:13:23","","","","","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND Publisher: FRONTIERS MEDIA SA Type: Article","","","","","EEG; social robotics; action perception; mirror neuron system; mu rhythm; theta rhythm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nowadays, technological breakthroughs might have a significant impact on our moral character and abilities. This is the case of Virtual Reality (VR) technologies. The aim of this paper is to consider the ethical aspects of the use of VR in enhancing empathy. First, we will offer an introduction to VR, explaining its fundamental features, devices and concepts. Then, we will approach the characterization of VR as an “empathy machine,” showing why this medium has aroused so much interest and why, nevertheless, we do not believe it is the ideal way to enhance empathy. As an alternative, we will consider fostering empathy-related abilities through virtual embodiment in avatars. In the conclusion, however, we will examine some of the serious concerns related to the ethical relevance of empathy and will defend the philosophical case for a reason-guided empathy, also suggesting specific guidelines for possible future developments of empathy enhancement projects through VR embodied experiences.","2020-11-09","2021-02-11 04:15:43","2021-02-11 04:15:43","","","","","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND Publisher: FRONTIERS MEDIA SA Type: Article","","","","","empathy; virtual reality; applied ethics; empathy enhancement; moral enhancement; moral psychology; neuroethics; virtual embodiment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Walter; Dawson, Peter F.","Simulating Peace Operations: New Digital Possibilities for Training and Public Education","SIMULATION & GAMING","","1046-8781","10.1177/1046878120968605","","Background and Motivation. A plethora of warfighting games exist commercially, but there is a lack of digital games that deal with peace processes. Furthermore, none simulate actual peacekeeping. The United Nations currently deploys about 100,000 peacekeepers to some of the world's most dangerous zones, where peacekeepers save lives, alleviate suffering, and help create conditions for peace. The United Nations and national militaries lack peacekeeping simulations to help train their soldiers. Additionally, the public needs to learn more about the way peacekeeping works. Thus, peacekeeping simulation and gaming are worth exploring, especially in the rapidly evolving digital space, which offers new avenues and benefits. Methods. We review the meager literature on the subject and observe that there are few digital games to directly draw from. We build on previous work that argued the need for such development, but we now assess important design principles and parameters. We draw upon peacekeeping tabletop exercises that are already well developed. Results. We conclude that excellent scenarios and simulation technologies exist that could be combined quite easily for effective peacekeeping training and public education. We find key materials and scenarios in exercises of the United Nations and of the Pearson Peacekeeping Centre. Highlighted areas for future digital design are the inclusion of non-military avatars, emphasis on soft skills development (especially empathy), and realistically complex links between actions and consequences. Conclusion. While describing some UN exploration at a proof-of-concept stage, we suggest that both the United Nations and the gaming industry should explore the idea further to achieve synergies between institutional and entertainment applications. The growing capacity of digital technology allows significant innovation, yielding results that could be useful, ethical, enjoyable, and potentially profitable.","","2021-02-11 04:15:43","2021-02-11 04:15:43","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 2455 ℡LER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA Publisher: SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC Type: Article; Early Access","","","","","empathy; digital games; peace operations; peace simulation; peacekeeping; stability operations; training < objective; United Nations; virtual gaming","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we tested the effects of some socio-cognitive variables that could contribute to enhancing or reducing the implicit racial bias. The first aim of the study was to assess the beneficial effects of cooperation within a VR scenario, the second aim was to provide preliminary testing of the hypothesis that empathy and political attitudes could contribute to implicit bias about race, while the third aim was to explore the relationship between political attitudes and empathy. We had (Caucasian) participants embodied in a Black virtual body and engaged either in a cooperative (Coop group) or in a non-cooperative (Neutral group) activity with a confederate experimenter embodying another Black avatar. Before and after VR, we measured participants' implicit racial bias by means of Implicit Association Test (IAT) and their perceived closeness toward the confederate experimenter. Before VR we also assessed participants' political attitudes and empathy traits. Results revealed that, as compared to the Neutral group, the Coop group showed lower IAT scores after the social interaction. Interestingly, in the Neutral but not the Coop group the perceived closeness toward the confederate experimenter was associated with the initial racial bias: the more the participants reduced their distance, the more they reduced their IAT score. Moreover, reported traits of empathy and political attitudes significantly explained the variance observed in the initial implicit bias, with perspective-taking, empathic concern, and personal distress being significant predictors of the IAT scores. Finally, there was a relationship between political attitudes and empathy: the more participants considered themselves as left-wing voters, the higher their perspective-taking and empathic concern scores. We discuss these findings within the neuroscientific and social cognition field and encourage scholars from different domains to further explore whether and under which conditions a given manipulation for reducing racial bias could be efficiently transposed in VR.","2020-10-28","2021-02-11 04:15:43","2021-02-11 04:15:43","","","","","11","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND Publisher: FRONTIERS MEDIA SA Type: Article","","","","","empathy; virtual reality; embodiment; cooperation; implicit association test; implicit racial bias; inclusion of the other in the self; political attitudes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

When this dyad is completed, mind attribution towards intentionally harmed liminal minds is enhanced. However, from a dehumanisation view, malevolent actions may instead result in a denial of humanness. To contrast both accounts, a visual vignette experiment (N = 253) depicted either malevolent or benevolent intentions towards robotic or human avatars. Additionally, we examined the role of harm-salience by showing patients as either harmed, or still unharmed. The results revealed significantly increased mind attribution towards visibly harmed patients, mediated by perceived pain and expressed empathy. Benevolent and malevolent intentions were evaluated respectively as morally right or wrong, but their impact on the patient was diminished for the robotic avatar. Contrary to dehumanisation predictions, our manipulation of intentions failed to affect mind perception. Nonetheless, benevolent intentions reduced dehumanisation of the patients. Moreover, when pain and empathy were statistically controlled, the effect of intentions on mind perception was mediated by dehumanisation. These findings suggest that perceived intentions might only be indirectly tied to mind perception, and that their role may be better understood when additionally accounting for empathy and dehumanisation.","","2021-02-11 04:15:44","2021-02-11 04:15:44","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: THE ATRIUM, SOUTHERN GATE, CHICHESTER PO19 8SQ, W SUSSEX, ENGLAND Publisher: JOHN WILEY & SONS LTD Type: Article; Early Access","","","","","Robots; Benevolent intentions; Dehumanisation; Mind perception; Moral typecasting theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These studies, however, have been mostly confined to laboratory settings with student populations and the use of artificial avatars. In an interdisciplinary effort benefiting from the heterogeneous sample within a museum, we aimed at quantifying changes in interpersonal perception induced by embodying a transgender man narrating his life. We compared an artistic methodology mixing VR and elaborate sensorimotor stimulation to a more conventional primarily audiovisual VR experience. We tested how these affect embodiment and the perception of transgender men as measured by a brief implicit association test and a questionnaire. Neither significant difference in embodiment nor changes in implicit or explicit bias was found, the latter potentially due to the initially low bias in the group. We further assessed participants' illusory embodiment as a function of age, finding a negative correlation between these. The results are discussed with respect to current theories of embodiment, differences between laboratory and real-life settings, and the intersection of art and science.","2020-08-04","2021-02-11 04:15:44","2021-02-11 04:15:44","","","","","11","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND Publisher: FRONTIERS MEDIA SA Type: Article","","","","","social cognition; embodiment; art-science dialogue; naturalistic settings; sensorimotor sharing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This has become an established methodological paradigm allowing the study of the psychological and neural correlates of various scenarios that are impossible in the real world, such as gender or age switching. Thus far, full-body ownership illusions have been implemented by using real-time body tracking and avatars based on computer-generated imagery (CGI). We propose an alternative technique to induce perceived ownership over a (photorealistic) virtual body using 180 degrees stereoscopic video, synchronous touch, and narration. We describe the technical components of our novel technique and an example implementation as part of a science-art project that enables participants to experience virtual bodies of different ages, and present the results of an experimental evaluation study based on this experience. Consistent with previous virtual embodiment studies using CGI-based techniques, we found that participants accept a photorealistic virtual body as their own irrespective of its appearance as indicated by similar ratings of the strength of body ownership over a virtual body of a child versus an adult. We further show that our novel technique can alter participants' cognition in accordance with the characteristics of their virtual body. Specifically, young adult participants who were embodied in the virtual body of a child significantly overestimated the duration of the virtual reality experience compared to a control group who was embodied in a virtual body of their own age. This finding corresponds to chronological age differences in time estimations and extends previous research on virtual child embodiment. Overall, these findings provide initial evidence for the potential of our novel technique to create photorealistic embodiment experiences with comparable psychological effects as have been found using CGI-based techniques while reducing the costs and technical complexity in the production and application of virtual body ownership illusions.","2020-07-07","2021-02-11 04:15:44","2021-02-11 04:15:44","","","","","11","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND Publisher: FRONTIERS MEDIA SA Type: Article","","","","","cognition; virtual reality; virtual embodiment; 180 degrees video; body ownership illusion; self-transformation; time perception","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Threatening information, e.g., by the use of technical language, is suggested to increase pain reports. Validation, or communicating understanding towards another person reporting personal experiences, is suggested to reduce pain. The current study examines effects of both information language (technical vs. plain language) and validation (validation vs. invalidation) on the subjective experience of experimentally induced pain. Methods: Pain-free participants (N = 132) were randomly assigned to one of four groups as formed by manipulations of validation and information language. After reading a description concerning the upcoming thermal stimulus formulated in technical or plain language, participants engaged in a computer controlled simulation (CCS; based on virtual reality technology). Participants received three thermal stimuli while interacting with an avatar who either validated or invalidated their experience during the CCS. Pain intensity and pain unpleasantness were assessed after each stimulus. Results: The validation manipulation showed to be effective, but the information language manipulation did not induce differential threat expectancies. Results show no effect of validation or information language on subjective pain reports. Limitations: Suboptimality of the information language manipulation and shortcomings of the CCS procedure might account for current findings. Conclusions: The study offers an interesting model for the further experimental study of isolated and combined effects of (social) contextual factors on pain. Diverse future research avenues are discussed.","2020-06","2021-02-11 04:15:44","2021-02-11 04:15:44","","","","SI","67","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND Publisher: PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD Type: Article","","","","","Context; Virtual reality; (in)validation; Computer controlled simulation; Pain communication; Pain experience; Thermal pain","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This simulates many of the nonspecific relational elements and common factors present in face-to-face therapy and may be a means of improving adherence to and efficacy of self-guided treatments. However, little is known about alliance toward the virtual therapist, despite alliance being an important predictor of treatment outcome. Objective: In this study, we aimed to evaluate the first alliance instrument developed for use with embodied virtual therapists in an automated treatment format-the Virtual Therapist Alliance Scale (VTAS)-by (1) assessing its psychometric properties, (2) verifying the dimensionality of the scale, and (3) determining the predictive ability of the scale with treatment outcome. Methods: A psychometric evaluation and exploratory factor analysis of the VTAS was conducted using data from two samples of spider-fearful patients treated with VRET and the help of an embodied, voice-based virtual therapist (n=70). Multiple regression models and bivariate correlations were used to assess the VTAS relationship with treatment outcome, according to self-reported fear and convergence with presence and user-friendliness process measures. Results: The VTAS showed a sound two-factor solution composed of a primary factor covering task, goal, and copresence; adequate internal consistency; and good convergent validity, including moderate correlation (r= . 310, P=.01) with outcomes over follow-up. Conclusions: These preliminary results suggest that alliance toward a virtual therapist is a significant predictor of treatment outcome, favors the importance of a task-goal over bond-factor, and should be explored in studies with larger sample sizes and in additional forms of embodiment.","2020-03-24","2021-02-11 04:15:45","2021-02-11 04:15:45","","","","3","22","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 130 QUEENS QUAY E, STE 1102, TORONTO, ON M5A 0P6, CANADA Publisher: JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC Type: Article","","","","","empathy; virtual reality; embodiment; presence; avatar; alliance; automated treatment; exposure therapy; psychometric; usability; virtual coach; virtual therapist","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we designed anthropomorphic avatars animated with motion tracking and tested whether the human brain processes fearful and neutral expressions in human and avatar faces differently. Our fMRI results showed that fearful human expressions evoked stronger responses than fearful avatar expressions in the ventral anterior and posterior cingulate gyrus, the anterior insula, the anterior and posterior superior temporal sulcus, and the inferior frontal gyrus. Fearful expressions in human and avatar faces evoked similar responses in the amygdala. We did not find different responses to neutral human and avatar expressions. Our results highlight differences, but also similarities in the processing of fearful human expressions and fearful avatar expressions even if they are designed to be highly anthropomorphic and animated with motion tracking. This has important consequences for research using dynamic avatars, especially when processes are investigated that involve cortical and subcortical regions.","2020-03","2021-02-11 04:15:45","2021-02-11 04:15:45","","347-358","","3","15","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND Publisher: OXFORD UNIV PRESS Type: Article","","","","","fMRI; emotion; avatar; computer-generated character; face","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We draw on a particular line of posthumanist theory associated closely with the work of Karen Barad, Rosi Braidotti and N. Katherine Hayles that suggests a constantly permeable, fluid and extended subjectivity, displacing the boundaries between human and other. In doing so, we propose a posthuman concept of empathy in gameplay, and we apply this concept to data from the first author's 18-month ethnographic field notes of gameplay in the MMORPG World of Warcraft. Exploring these data through our analysis of posthuman empathy, we demonstrate the entanglement of avatar-player, machine-human relationship. We show how empathy allows us to understand this relationship as constantly negotiated and in process, producing visceral reactions in the intra-connected avatar-player subject as well as moments of co-produced in-game action that require `affective matching' between subjective and embodied experiences. We argue that this account of the avatar-player relationship extends research in game culture, providing a horizontal, non-hierarchical discussion of its most necessary interaction.","2019-12","2021-02-11 04:15:45","2021-02-11 04:15:45","","791-806","","5-6","25","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 2455 ℡LER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA Publisher: SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC Type: Article","","","","","empathy; posthuman; embodiment; Avatar-player relationships; digital culture; MMORPG; posthuman empathy; posthuman subjectivity; World of Warcraft","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the traditional use of didactic lectures for communication skills training is ineffective, and the use of standardized patients is not time- or cost-effective. Given the abilities of virtual patients (VPs) to simulate interactive and authentic clinical scenarios in secured environments with unlimited training attempts, a virtual counseling application is an ideal platform for nursing students to hone their communication skills before their clinical postings. Objective: The aim of this study was to develop and test the use of VPs to better prepare nursing undergraduates for communicating with real-life patients, their family members, and other health care professionals during their clinical postings. Methods: The stages of the creation of VPs included preparation, design, and development, followed by a testing phase before the official implementation. An initial voice chatbot was trained using a natural language processing engine, Google Cloud's Dialogflow, and was later visualized into a three-dimensional (3D) avatar form using Unity 3D. Results: The VPs included four case scenarios that were congruent with the nursing undergraduates' semesters' learning objectives: (1) assessing the pain experienced by a pregnant woman, (2) taking the history of a depressed patient, (3) escalating a bleeding episode of a postoperative patient to a physician, and (4) showing empathy to a stressed-out fellow final-year nursing student. Challenges arose in terms of content development, technological limitations, and expectations management, which can be resolved by contingency planning, open communication, constant program updates, refinement, and training. Conclusions: The creation of VPs to assist in nursing students' communication skills training may provide authentic learning environments that enhance students' perceived self-efficacy and confidence in effective communication skills. However, given the infancy stage of this project, further refinement and constant enhancements are needed to train the VPs to simulate real-life conversations before the official implementation.","2019-10-29","2021-02-11 04:15:46","2021-02-11 04:15:46","","","","10","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 130 QUEENS QUAY E, STE 1102, TORONTO, ON M5A 0P6, CANADA Publisher: JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC Type: Article","","","","","artificial intelligence; learning; communication; virtual reality; technology; nursing education; patients","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Seven videos of facial expressions of pain were created with four different avatars (2 women): six sequential onsets combining the three sets of AUs and one synchronized onset. 45 healthy adults (22 women; aged 23.6 +/- 5.2 years) rated the realism of facial movements, and the level of intensity and unpleasantness of perceived pain. A more realistic expression was associated with the onset of O before or at the same time as N, a more intense expression was associated when B occurred last, and a higher level of unpleasantness was associated with the onset of N before B.

Given the prevalence of computer-animated human characters and a narrative framework in videogames, serious games, and health-related scenarios, it is important to examine how the uncanny valley influences narrative empathy and enjoyment. In a 2 x 2 x 2 between-groups posttest-only experiment, 738 participants took the role of a patient in a virtual consultation with a doctor; the consultation varied in the doctor's character (hero or villain), its subplot ending (happy or tragic), and its depiction (computer animated or real). The participants' posttest results showed greater emotional empathy and enjoyment in the hero condition and no significant difference in emotional empathy for the computer animation but greater narrative enjoyment and persuasion. Just endings (hero rewarded, villain punished) elicited much greater pleasure than unjust endings. In comparing computer animation with recorded video, emotional empathy was a significantly stronger predictor of narrative enjoyment than transportation only for the real hero with a tragic ending. The enjoyment and persuasiveness of the computer-animated doctor patient consultation bodes well for the use of animation in interactive visual narratives.","2019-05","2021-02-11 04:15:46","2021-02-11 04:15:46","","140-153","","","94","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND Publisher: PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD Type: Article","","","","","Uncanny valley; Avatars; Anthropomorphism; Computer animation; Emotional empathy; Interactive narratives","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The present research aimed to investigate the impact of occupational stereotypes, evoked by attire, as well as posture on person perception. For this, computer animation was used to create avatars with different types of attire (nurse, military, casual) and posture (open, closed). In Study 1 (N=164), participants attributed significantly more empathy to avatars wearing a nurse versus a military uniform or casual outfit. When adding posture as an additional cue, Study 2 (N=312) showed that ratings of empathy and dominance were affected by both attire and posture. This effect was replicated in Study 3 (N=163) for female avatars, in the sense that open postures in nurses increased empathy ratings and decreased dominance ratings, which both in turn led to greater perceived competence. By contrast, for male avatars, posture did not affect attributions of competence directly. Rather, attire predicted perceived dominance directly, as well as through perceived empathy. The present findings suggest that both posture, and occupational information evoked by attire, are used to infer personal characteristics. However, the strength of each cue may vary with the gender of the target.","2019-03","2021-02-11 04:15:46","2021-02-11 04:15:46","","23-38","","1","43","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article","","","","","Dominance; Empathy; Body posture; Clothing; Competence; Occupational stereotypes; Warmth","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Stemming from earlier laboratory research, we conducted five experiments to investigate the effects of social presence on contagious yawning in virtual reality (VR). We show that, similar to a traditional laboratory setting, having a researcher present during testing significantly inhibited contagious yawning in VR, even though participants were viewing a virtual environment and unable to see the researcher. Unlike previous research, however, manipulating the social presence in VR (i.e., embedding recording devices and humanoid avatars within the simulation) did not affect contagious yawning. These experiments provide further evidence that social presence is a powerful deterrent of yawning in humans, which warrants further investigation. More generally, these findings also have important applications for the use of VR in psychological research. While participants were quite sensitive to social stimuli presented in VR, as evidenced by contagious yawning, our results suggest a major difference in the influence of social factors within real-world and virtual environments. That is, social cues in actual reality appear to dominate and supersede those in VR.","2019-01-22","2021-02-11 04:15:46","2021-02-11 04:15:46","","","","","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND Publisher: NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To validate our claim, we use the example of three very different creatures-a scorpion, a rhino, and a bird-to explore possible avatar controls and game mechanics based on specific animal abilities. A quantitative evaluation underpins the high game enjoyment arising from embodying such nonhuman morphologies, including additional body parts and obtaining respective superhuman skills, which allows us to derive a set of novel design implications. Furthermore, the experiment reveals a correlation between IVBO and game enjoyment, which is a further indication that nonhumanoid creatures offer a meaningful design space for VR games worth further investigation.","2019","2021-02-11 04:15:46","2021-02-11 04:15:46","","439-451","","","","","","","","","","","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: ACM SIGCHI; Assoc Comp Machinery Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>6th ACM SIGCHI Annual Symposium on Computer-Human Interaction in Play (CHI PLAY), Barcelona, SPAIN, OCT 22-25, 2019</p>","","","","Animal avatars; animal embodiment; avatar control; IVBO; virtual creatures; virtual reality games","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Theoretical Rationale and Proposal of a Randomized Controlled Trial","NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND REDESIGNING LEARNING SPACES, VOL I","","","10.12753/2066-026X-19-011","","Perspective-taking is a core theory of mind process, entailing the ability to understand and predict others' mental states. While the literature suggests that priming a perspective-taking stance increases empathic concern and intergroup cohesion and reduces implicit negative attitudes such as racial bias and prejudice, no study up to date has attempted to foster perspective-taking implicitly, by training visual perspective-taking in a computerized task. In the current paper, we propose a computerized, gamified intervention for visual perspective-taking in adolescents and young adults. The intervention is an adapted version of extant visual perspective-taking assessment protocols and is envisioned to train participants to selectively attend to the visual perspective of an animated avatar, instead of their own. By training an allocentric bias, the intervention aims to increase empathic and theory of mind abilities and to foster interpersonal communication and cohesion. An additionally hypothesized benefit of the intervention is a decrease in self-focused attention, a marker of social anxiety disorder. As such, the intervention is suited to address two different, but inter-related needs: optimizing social functioning and managing social anxiety symptomatology. Introducing users to gamification elements, such as earning badges, advancing through increasing difficulty levels, receiving feedback and leaderboards highlighting achievements, is intended to increase the intervention's efficacy and to promote adherence. Design considerations for testing the intervention in an experimental trial will additionally be proposed, with the intervention contrasted against a sham control condition that will equally train egocentric and allocentric biases in visual perspective-taking. Theoretical and practical implications for educational settings will be discussed.","2019","2021-02-11 04:15:47","2021-02-11 04:15:47","","91-97","","","","","","","eLearning and Software for Education","","","","CAROL I NATL DEFENCE UNIV PUBLISHING HOUSE","PANDURI ST, 68-72, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: European Secur & Def Coll; Romania Partnership Ctr; Natl Def Univ Carol I ISSN: 2066-026X Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>15th International Scientific Conference on eLearning and Software for Education (eLSE) - New Technologies and Redesigning Learning Spaces, Bucharest, ROMANIA, APR 11-12, 2019</p>","","","","perspective-taking; theory of mind; computerized; gamification; training","Roceanu, I and Belgian, D and Stefan, IA and Moldoveanu, A and Matu, ST","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The different contributions of these processes have not been teased apart. By capitalizing on the power of Immersive Virtual Reality, we explored how behavioural (subjective ratings) and physiological reactivity (skin conductance reactivity, SCR) to pain and pleasure delivered to an avatar was influenced by Cognitive stance and Physical perspective. Taking an Other-Oriented stance leads to attributing higher congruent valence (i.e. pain rated as unpleasant and pleasure as pleasant) and intensity to the stimuli and induces reduced SCR.

Currently, we investigated if the presence of a facial wound enhanced the perception of mental capacities (experience and agency) in response to images of robotic and human-like avatars, compared with unharmed avatars. The results revealed that harmed versions of both robotic and human-like avatars were imbued with mind to a higher degree, irrespective of the baseline level of mind attributed to their unharmed counterparts. Perceptions of capacity for pain mediated attributions of experience, while both pain and empathy mediated attributions of abilities linked to agency.

A growing number of electroencephalography studies also suggest that it might be useful to assess empathy. The main goal of this study was to use quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) to test whether observation of pain expressed by an avatar (virtual reality) induces a suppression of alpha waves over sensorimotor cortical areas, as it is observed with human stimuli. Not only was it the case, but also the magnitude of alpha suppression was correlated with perspective-taking capacity of participants. Both empathy levels and magnitude of sensorimotor alpha suppression (SAS) were significantly higher in women than men. Interestingly, a significant interaction emerged between levels of individual empathy and specificity of experimental instructions, where SAS in participants with good perspective-taking was higher during passive observation of the distressed avatar, while the opposite was true during an active (trying to understand) condition. These results suggest that: (1) synthetic characters are able to elicit SAS; (2) SAS is indeed associated with perspective-taking capacities; (3) Persons with poorer perspective-taking capacities can show significant SAS when proper instructions are provided. Therefore, qEEG represents a low-cost objective approach to measure perspective-taking abilities.","2018-07-09","2021-02-11 04:15:48","2021-02-11 04:15:48","","","","","12","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND Publisher: FRONTIERS MEDIA SA Type: Article","","","","","electroencephalography; empathy; perspective taking; assessment; avatar; alpha suppression; qEEG","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This project sought to explore interactions with the neuropsychologist's avatar in virtual locations using a VR social network as an available experience. Results: Three patients experienced VR. Despite some limitations due to patient positioning during the operation and the limitation of nonverbal cues inherent to the app, the neuropsychologist, as an avatar, could communicate with the patient and explore gesture communication while wearing a VR headset.

Thus, this study set out to examine social avoidance tendencies and prosocial behaviors towards human controlled (avatars) and computer controlled entities (agents). A total of N = 95 healthy young adults were randomly assigned to an avatar or agent condition. Participants were exposed to a virtual stranger asking to sit at the table (prosocial behavior) as well as a virtual waiter handing over the false drink (social avoidance). Empathy, interaction anxiety, social and physical presence as well as subjective stress levels were assessed to control for confounding influences. Empathy emerged as a significant predictor of prosocial behavior. Social avoidance, in turn, was not predicted by any of the included variables. Also, there was no effect of agency on social presence, physical presence, social interaction anxiety and stress. Yet, participants showed significantly more social avoidance and prosocial behavior towards avatars. These seemingly contradictory results may be explained by an extension of prior theories: While intuitive responses (e.g., stress) follow the Media Equation Concept (Nass & Moon, 2000), more complex processes (e.g., empathy) may modulate agency dependent responses.

VR learning is always delivered using VR devices or installations. Compared to VR installations such as Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE), with the careful design of VR software, VR headsets can achieve a similar degree of immersion and interactivity at a fraction of the cost, while keeping the whole setup highly portable and requirements on the venue space at a minimum. However, there is a lack of research on delivering VR learning for the ASD population using VR headsets. In this paper, we report a case study involving four children with ASD, who were recruited to experience the prototype software for VR learning in our laboratory environment. Our observation reveals that the design allows children with ASD comprehend the threedimensional world and interact with virtual objects and avatars smoothly while using the VR headsets.","2018","2021-02-11 04:15:50","2021-02-11 04:15:50","","728-734","","","","","","","EDULEARN Proceedings","","","","IATED-INT ASSOC TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION & DEVELOPMENT","LAURI VOLPI 6, VALENICA, BURJASSOT 46100, SPAIN","English","","","","","","","ISSN: 2340-1117 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>10th International Conference on Education and New Learning Technologies (EDULEARN), Palma, SPAIN, JUL 02-04, 2018</p>","","","","autism; special education; virtual reality headset; Virtual reality learning","Chova, LG and Martinez, AL and Torres, IC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A Reanalysis of Gabbiadini et al. 2016","JOURNAL OF YOUTH AND ADOLESCENCE","","0047-2891","10.1007/s10964-017-0700-x","","Gabbiadini, A., Riva, P., Andrighetto, L., Volpato, C., & Bushman, B, (PloS ONE, 2016) provided evidence for a connection between “sexist” video games and decreased empathy toward girls using an experimental paradigm. These claims are based on a moderated mediation model. They reported a three-way interaction between game condition, gender, and avatar identification when predicting masculine ideology in their original study. Masculine ideology was associated, in turn, with decreased empathy. However, there were no main experimental effects for video game condition on empathy. The current analysis considers the strength of the evidence for claims made in the original study on a sample of 153 adolescents (M (age) = 16.812, SD = 1.241; 44.2% male). We confirmed that there was little evidence for an overall effect of game condition on empathy toward girls or women. We tested the robustness of the original reported moderated mediation models against other, theoretically derived alternatives, and found that effects differed based on how variables were measured (using alternatives in their public data file) and the statistical model used. The experimental groups differed significantly and substantially in terms of age suggesting that there might have been issues with the procedures used to randomly assign participants to conditions. These results highlight the need for preregistration of experimental protocols in video game research and raise some concerns about how moderated mediation models are used to support causal inferences. These results call into question whether use of “sexist” video games is a causal factor in the development of reduced empathy toward girls and women among adolescents.","2017-12","2021-02-11 04:15:50","2021-02-11 04:15:50","","2446-2459","","12","46","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA Publisher: SPRINGER/PLENUM PUBLISHERS Type: Article","","","","","Empathy; Masculinity; Sexism; Video games; Violence","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The existence of an implicit mentalizing system has generated considerable debate however, centered on the ability of various experimental paradigms to demonstrate unambiguously such mentalizing. Evidence for implicit mentalizing has previously been provided by the `dot perspective task,' where participants are slower to verify the number of dots they can see when an avatar can see a different number of dots. However, recent evidence challenged a mentalizing interpretation of this effect by showing it was unaltered when the avatar was replaced with an inanimate arrow stimulus. Here we present an extension of the dot perspective task using an invisibility cloaking device to render the dots invisible on certain trials. This paradigm is capable of providing unambiguous evidence of automatic mentalizing, but no such evidence was found. Two further well-powered experiments used opaque and transparent goggles to manipulate visibility but found no evidence of automatic mentalizing, nor of individual differences in empathy or perspective-taking predicting performance, contradicting previous studies using the same design. The results cast doubt on the existence of an implicit mentalizing system, suggesting that previous effects were due to domain-general processes.","2017-03","2021-02-11 04:15:50","2021-02-11 04:15:50","","454-465","","3","43","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA Publisher: AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC Type: Article","","","","","theory of mind; domain-general processing; implicit mentalizing; submentalizing; visual perspective taking","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Background: Authors of recent work have explored psychological similarities in how people trust humanlike automation compared with how they trust other humans. Exogenous administration of oxytocin, a neuropeptide associated with trust among humans, offers a unique opportunity to probe the anthropomorphism continuum of automation to infer when agents are trusted like another human or merely a machine. Method: Eighty-four healthy male participants collaborated with automated agents varying in anthropomorphism that provided recommendations in a pattern recognition task. Results: Under placebo, participants exhibited less trust and compliance with automated aids as the anthropomorphism of those aids increased. Under oxytocin, participants interacted with aids on the extremes of the anthropomorphism continuum similarly to placebos but increased their trust, compliance, and performance with the avatar, an agent on the midpoint of the anthropomorphism continuum. Conclusion: This study provides the first evidence that administration of exogenous oxytocin affected trust, compliance, and team decision making with automated agents. These effects provide support for the premise that oxytocin increases affinity for social stimuli in automated aids. Application: Designing automation to mimic basic human characteristics is sufficient to elicit behavioral trust outcomes that are driven by neurological processes typically observed in human-human interactions. Designers of automated systems should consider the task, the individual, and the level of anthropomorphism to achieve the desired outcome.","2017-02","2021-02-11 04:15:51","2021-02-11 04:15:51","","116-133","","1","59","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 2455 ℡LER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA Publisher: SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC Type: Article","","","","","neuroergonomics; virtual humans; autonomous agents; compliance and reliance; human-automation interaction; oxytocin; trust in automation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Correspondingly, drift measurements in science are used as a means of rating the intensity of a body-ownership illusion via which a participant in a controlled experiment perceives that an extracorporeal appendage, or virtual whole-body avatar is incorporated as part of one's own body schema. In this research article, I will examine an applied performance by BeAnotherLab utilising the anti-disciplinary collective's The Machine to Be Another as part of Good Chance's Encampment project - this telepresence system produces a VR body illusion intended to increase empathy and reduce proximity between an immersant's real body and that of a volunteer refugee counterpart. When scientifically-tested body illusions cross a paradigmatic boundary to be framed as immersive art, what are the ethical implications? Furthermore, are these kinds of virtual proprioceptive transactions across different kinds of social and political boundaries symptomatic of radical empathic acts, or a capitalistic desire for the acquisition of another's experiences by virtual means? This article examines illusory bodily inhabitation through a Levinasian critical lens to consider the ethics of deterritorializing the immersant's gaze and referring their sense of touch elsewhere to produce narrative immersion'.","2017","2021-02-11 04:15:51","2021-02-11 04:15:51","","30-37","","3","22","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND Publisher: TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

New teaching methodologies are increasingly using virtual world teaching, interactive models, educational games and Avatars. Through this wave of virtual reality education are important affective domain learning outcomes at risk? During the mid to late 1900s, Bloom and his colleagues recognised that learning could be divided into three categories or domains; cognitive (knowledge), affective (attitude) and psychomotor (skills). The highest level of affective domain learning outcomes involve the “development in one's personal and civic life a code of behaviour based on ethical principles consistent with democratic ideals”.(1) Domains of professionalism in relation to medical practice include ethical practice, reflection/self-awareness, responsibility for actions, respect for patients, teamwork and social responsibility.(2) So, what is the impact of studying anatomy through dissection? In answering this question, most anatomists and students will talk about the value in learning anatomy and of understanding function. While this is true, I believe it goes far beyond this simplistic view. Studying the human body or cadaver can be an emotional experience, sharing the grief of the family following the death of the person they loved as well as a source of wonder at the beauty and perfection of the human body. We are reminded of how much we take life for granted as we go about our day to day activities. In other words, it puts life into perspective. Medical training all too often remains grounded in the biomedical model, with the cognitive domain overshadowing the psychosocial development and needs of learners.(3) Some of the unique aspects of cadaveric dissection include the realistic nature of this teaching medium that allows students to grasp a clear visuo-spatial picture of the organization of human body, experience the texture of human tissues, witness and comprehend pathological conditions while learning the normal and compare the normal vs pathological.(4) Student views range from “enhances my respect for the human body” to “makes learning of anatomy more interesting”. Our results suggest that the more thorough, enduring and contextual learning experience provided by cadaveric dissections are better appreciated in clinical workplaces where the knowledge could be applied to clinical situations. This paper presents an overview of current views regarding affective domain learning outcomes and anatomy teaching methodologies. It highlights the likely importance of the use of human body parts and of dissection in the development of various domains of professionalism in relation to medical practice. As educators should we be more mindful of what learning outcomes might be threatened through replacing reality with virtual reality?","2017","2021-02-11 04:15:51","2021-02-11 04:15:51","","7502-7511","","","","","","","EDULEARN Proceedings","","","","IATED-INT ASSOC TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION & DEVELOPMENT","LAURI VOLPI 6, VALENICA, BURJASSOT 46100, SPAIN","English","","","","","","","ISSN: 2340-1117 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>9th International Conference on Education and New Learning Technologies (EDULEARN), Barcelona, SPAIN, JUL 03-05, 2017</p>","","","","empathy; virtual reality; professionalism; affective domain; Anatomy; dissection; humanising","Chova, LG and Martinez, AL and Torres, IC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Digital games show some unique properties that make them valuable for inducing social change. Some of the game elements that can be used to integrate values are as follows: Narration, which is one of the elements that is most obvious to players and is part of most of today's digital games, is a proper way of presenting human rights topics and can also include ideological messages. However, there are also other ways of creating empathy for certain groups as the example of Ayitii - The Cost of Life shows: If players feel responsible for the game characters, games can make players think about the topic presented. Being able to take meaningful decisions which influence the player's avatar, other non-playable characters, the narration or the game-world is a property of many recent games. Thus, ethical decisions are included in games and put players into the shoes of those who are oppressed or put in other situations where there is no easy way of deciding if something is right or wrong. Finally, the article also discusses if these serious games can affect players' real lives and change their way of thinking and attitudes. The serious game This War of Mine shows that some players think about their decisions and the topic of the game even after having stopped playing. However, there are also restrictions to transferring game contents into players' lives and induce social change. Quite often it is not enough just to play the game, teaching which must take place in a non-game context, is needed to make players aware of human rights (violations).","2017","2021-02-11 04:15:52","2021-02-11 04:15:52","","191-196","","","","","","","Proceedings of the European Conference on Games-Based Learning","","","","ACAD CONFERENCES LTD","CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: FH JOANNEUM Univ Appl Sci ISSN: 2049-0992 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>11th European Conference on Game-Based Learning (ECGBL), Graz, AUSTRIA, OCT 05-06, 2017</p>","","","","empathy; serious games; game elements; human rights; social change","Pivec, M and Grundler, J","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Current commercially-available RPSs, the most commonly used humanoid robots worldwide, are substantially limited in their usability and fidelity due to the fact that they lack one of the most important clinical interaction and diagnostic tools: an expressive face. Using autonomous facial synthesis techniques, we synthesized pain both on a humanoid robot and comparable virtual avatar. We conducted an experiment with 51 clinicians and 51 laypersons (n = 102), to explore differences in pain perception across the two groups, and also to explore the effects of embodiment (robot or avatar) on pain perception. Our results suggest that clinicians have lower overall accuracy in detecting synthesized pain in comparison to lay participants. We also found that all participants are overall less accurate detecting pain from a humanoid robot in comparison to a comparable virtual avatar, lending support to other recent findings in the HRI community.

Prior research has found that virtual pets have the potential to promote learning, collaboration, and empathy among users. While virtual reality (VR) has become an increasingly popular game medium, little is known about users' expectations regarding game avatars, gameplay, and environments for VR-enabled pet games. We surveyed 780 respondents in an online survey and interviewed 30 participants to understand users' motivation, preferences, and game behavior in pet games played on various medium, and their expectations for VR pet games. Based on our findings, we generated three user types that reflect users' preferences and gameplay styles in VR pet games. We use these types to highlight key design opportunities and recommendations for VR pet games.","2017","2021-02-11 04:15:53","2021-02-11 04:15:53","","","","","","","","","","","","","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: ACM SIGCHI; ACM SIGGRAPH Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>23rd ACM Conference on Virtual Reality Software and Technology (VRST), Chalmers Univ Technol, Gothenburg, SWEDEN, NOV 08-10, 2017</p>","","","","Pet Game; User Types; Virtual Pet; Virtual Reality","Spencer, SN","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A video camera was used to capture an actor's performance. The actor's eyes and mouth were isolated, and footage was processed as movie textures to overlay a static 3D model of a head. Micro expressions (subtle, rapid movements of muscles in and around the eyes and mouth in particular) are thus captured in a fine-grained, yet low- cost and low-tech alternative to established techniques. A future experiment will compare the emotive efficacy of the hybrid virtual agent with that of a conventional (fully CG) rigged avatar head in a 6DoF scenario that transitions from sympathetic (gauging empathy by self-report) to confrontational (gauging physiological arousal by heart-rate or GSR). The experiment's prospective design is discussed, as well as its significance for the study of the crucial intersection of social plausibility and perceptual realism in VR.","2017","2021-02-11 04:15:53","2021-02-11 04:15:53","","","","","","","","","","","","","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: ACM SIGCHI; ACM SIGGRAPH Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>23rd ACM Conference on Virtual Reality Software and Technology (VRST), Chalmers Univ Technol, Gothenburg, SWEDEN, NOV 08-10, 2017</p>","","","","Virtual reality; social presence; avatar capture; social plausibility","Spencer, SN","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, much less is known about how taking a physical perspective influences reactivity to the observation of others' pain and pleasure. To explore this issue we devised a novel paradigm in which 24 healthy participants immersed in a virtual reality scenario observed a virtual: needle penetrating (pain), caress (pleasure), or ball touching (neutral) the hand of an avatar seen from a first (1PP)- or a third (3PP)-person perspective. Subjective ratings and physiological responses [skin conductance responses (SCR) and heart rate (HR)] were collected in each trial. All participants reported strong feelings of ownership of the virtual hand only in 1PP. Subjective measures also showed that pain and pleasure were experienced as more salient than neutral. SCR analysis demonstrated higher reactivity in 1PP than in 3PP. Importantly, vicarious pain induced stronger responses with respect to the other conditions in both perspectives. HR analysis revealed equally lower activity during pain and pleasure with respect to neutral. SCR may reflect egocentric perspective, and HR may merely index general arousal. The results suggest that behavioral and physiological indexes of reactivity to seeing others' pain and pleasure were qualitatively similar in 1PP and 3PP. Our paradigm indicates that virtual reality can be used to study vicarious sensation of pain and pleasure without actually delivering any stimulus to participants' real body and to explore behavioral and physiological reactivity when they observe pain and pleasure from ego- and allocentric perspectives.","2016-12","2021-02-11 04:15:54","2021-02-11 04:15:54","","2656-2662","","6","116","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA Publisher: AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC Type: Article","","","","","empathy; body ownership; pleasant touch; skin conductance and heart rate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Method. - From the perspective of a theoretical opening both phenomenological and psychoanalytic, auto empathy is the process in which, taking the position of the “other-in-oneself”, we represent our subjective world - or the all states of our subjectivity (actions, emotions, thoughts) - by an empathic relationship with ourselves. The auto-empathy relationship is a process of distancing, and symbolic appropriation, in which we are divided into halves, implementing our innate ability to be both subject and object for ourselves. Results. - The mediatization of auto-empathy in digital worlds can put ourselves instead of a figure that represents us - our avatar - so that our empathy is turned towards ourselves indirectly. This second time of empathy for a virtual figure of the self, called “mediatized auto-empathy” or “virtual auto-empathy”, would contribute thirdly to the development of empathy for oneself. Finally, the development of empathy for others would be supported in a fourth time, by the attention the players are paying to each other in network games. Discussion. - These four hypotheses, illustrated by clinical cases, open an interrogation concerning the frame of the psychoanalytical work. In the adolescent, the `work of virtualisation, which consists in the creative anticipation of its subjective possibilities, seems regularly impeded. The mental duplicity is no longer in a position to operate a symbolizing distance between the real self and the virtual self, between the subjective self and the subjectivising self. The other-in-oneself is ineffective in proposing to the adolescent an empathic dialogue with oneself. Consequently, the autorepresentation flirts with the seizure, in particular in the subjective states of breaks. Nevertheless, the digital spaces could be indirect media of appropriation of subjective experiences for the teenager. Conclusion. - Our reflections led us to think of auto-empathy as the realization of the other-in-oneself which allows us to represent our own subjective world. The auto-empathy mediatized by an avatar can thus be described as a representation by empathy of our subjective part that contains this character. From then on, the space of the video game appears as a space of subjectivation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The designed avatar presents a humanoid face that displays emotions with a subtlety akin to that of real life human emotions, with those emotions changing according to the interactions that the user chooses to perform on the avatar. We have used Blender for the design of the emotions, which are happiness, sadness, surprise, fear and anger, plus a neutral emotion, while Unity was used to dictate the behavior of the avatar when the interactions were performed, which could be positive (caress), negative (poke) or neutral (wait). The avatar has been evaluated by 48 people from different backgrounds and the results show the overall positive reception by the users, as well as the difference between neurotypical and non-neurotypical users in terms of emotion recognition and chosen interactions.

Analyses focused on the relationship between empathy and two perspective-taking phenomena: Selection between competing perspectives (i.e., perspective-congruence effects) and prioritization of the Self avatar's perspective. Empathy was related to improved overall performance on this task and a reduced cost of selecting between conflicting perspectives (i.e., smaller perspective-congruence effects). This effect was asymmetric, with empathy (i.e., empathic concern) levels predicting reduced interference from a conflicting perspective, especially when adopting the Self (vs. Other) avatar's perspective. Taken together, these results highlight the importance of the self-other distinction and mental flexibility components of empathy.","2016","2021-02-11 04:15:55","2021-02-11 04:15:55","","170-181","","1-4, SI","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND Publisher: ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD Type: Article","","","","","Empathy; Personal relevance; Self-tagging; Visual perspective-taking","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although the most persuasive computer interfaces are often the most human-like, they have been predicted to incur the greatest risk of falling into the uncanny valley, the loss of empathy attributed to characters that appear eerily human. Previous studies compared interfaces on the left side of the uncanny valley, namely, those with low human likeness. To examine interfaces with higher human realism, a between-groups factorial experiment was conducted through the internet with 426 midwestern U.S. undergraduates. This experiment presented a hypothetical ethical dilemma followed by the advice of an authority figure. The authority was manipulated in three ways: depiction (digitally recorded or computer animated), motion quality (smooth or jerky), and advice (disclose or refrain from disclosing sensitive information). Of these, only the advice changed opinion about the ethical dilemma, even though the animated depiction was significantly eerier than the human depiction. These results indicate that compliance with an authority persists even when using an uncannily realistic computer-animated double.","2015","2021-02-11 04:15:56","2021-02-11 04:15:56","","1-23","","1","24","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA Publisher: MIT PRESS Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the current study, we explored the relationship between visuospatial perspective taking and self-report measures of the cognitive and emotional components of empathy in young adults. To this aim, we employed a priming paradigm, in which the presence of an avatar allowed to anticipate the next perceived perspective on the visual scene. We found that the emotional dimension of empathy was positively correlated with the behavioral advantage provided by the presence of the avatar, relative to unprimed perspective changes.

The challenge stems partly from the complexity and fluidity of this social process, but also from its covert nature. One powerful tool to enhance experimental control over such dynamic social interactions has been the use of avatars in virtual reality (VR); information about an individual in such an interaction can be collected through the analysis of his or her neurophysiological and behavioral responses. We have developed a unique platform, the Empathy-Enhancing Virtual Evolving Environment (EEVEE), which is built around three main components: (1) different avatars capable of expressing feelings and emotions at various levels based on the Facial Action Coding System (FACS); (2) systems for measuring the physiological responses of the observer (heart and respiration rate, skin conductance, gaze and eye movements, facial expression); and (3) a multimodal interface linking the avatar's behavior to the observer's neurophysiological response. In this article, we provide a detailed description of the components of this innovative platform and validation data from the first phases of development. Our data show that healthy adults can discriminate different negative emotions, including pain, expressed by avatars at varying intensities. We also provide evidence that masking part of an avatar's face (top or bottom half) does not prevent the detection of different levels of pain. This innovative and flexible platform provides a unique tool to study and even modulate empathy in a comprehensive and ecological manner in various populations, notably individuals suffering from neurological or psychiatric disorders.","2015-03-10","2021-02-11 04:15:56","2021-02-11 04:15:56","","","","","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND Publisher: FRONTIERS MEDIA SA Type: Article","","","","","emotions; pain; empathy; affective computing; virtual reality; avatar; FACS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Normalized outputs of the AU recognition step are then used as inputs for a neural network that consists of an habituation network plus a competitive network. Both the competitive and the habituation layer use differential equations, thus taking into account the dynamic information of facial expressions through time. Experimental results carried out on live video sequences and on the Cohn-Kanade face database show that the proposed method provides high recognition hit rates. To assess the suitability of the developed emotional recognition system for human-computer interaction applications, it has been successfully integrated in the architecture of an avatar and we have conducted a preliminary experiment on empathy.

Its first dimension is auto-empathy and refers to an empathetic relationship with oneself: how can a human directing a robot expand the various components of empathy he feels for himself to this robot? The second is direct empathy: what does a human attribute to a robot in terms of thoughts, emotions, action potentials or even altruism, on the model of what he imagines and attributes to himself? The third dimension is reciprocal empathy that consists of thinking that a robot is able to identify with me, feel or guess my emotions and thoughts, anticipate my actions and wear me assistance if necessary. Finally, the fourth dimension, intersubjective empathy, is about thinking and imagining that a robot can inform me of things - emotions, thoughts that I am likely to experience- that I do not know about myself. Each of these four dimensions includes four different components: (1) Action (empathy of action), (2) Emotion (emotional empathy), (3) Cognition (cognitive empathy) and (4) Assistance (empathy of assistance). This theoretical model of empathy in four dimensions and four components defines sixteen items whose relevance will be tested in the near future through comparative experimental research involving human-human and human-robot interaction.","2015-02","2021-02-11 04:15:57","2021-02-11 04:15:57","","97-102","","1","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article","","","","","Psychology; Human-robot interaction; Auto-empathy; Direct empathy; Empathy with robots; Intersubjective empathy; Reciprocal empathy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Impairments of both empathic and visuo-spatial abilities have been observed in patients with schizophrenia. Especially, it has been suggested that schizophrenics are altered in spontaneously simulating another individual's first-person experience. However, there is so far only little evidence regarding the relationship between deficits in empathy and disturbances in spontaneous heterocentered coding in schizophrenia. In the present pilot-study, we tested with schizophrenic patients our behavioural paradigm that enables to measure from the bodily postures and movements whether individuals in ecologically more valid conditions are interacting with another individual by using egocentered - as in sympathy (feeling with someone else) - or heterocentered - as in empathy - visuo-spatial mechanisms. For that, ten patients and ten controls, standing and moving, interacted with a virtual tightrope walker, displayed life-sized, standing and moving as well. We show that patients with higher negative symptoms had, in most cases, deficits in spontaneously using heterocentered visuo-spatial mechanisms and employed preferentially an egocentered referencing to interact with the avatar. In contrast, preserved spontaneous heterocentered visuo-spatial strategies were not linked to a prevailing negative or positive symptomatology. Our data suggest that the severity of the negative symptoms in schizophrenia relates with disturbances of spontaneous (”online”) empathic processing in association with lower scoring self-reported trait cognitive empathy.

Grappling with the broad contours of the cultural economy of justice on national television in India, I suggest that the star descends upon television as an avatar promising empathy to a variety of victims of social injustice. In so doing, Khan converts crime news into emotional truths. The show has not only generated public debate, it also invites the public to return to a performative innocence. As television becomes the site of articulating moral authority, ritual participation and demanding social change, the political is re-assembled through Khan's stardom.

The shift from the scope of measurement to that of training required the software to be capable to adaptively suggest effective strategies appropriate to the user's profile. Notwithstanding the theoretical framework and the approach to the representation of spatial reference systems, the specific educational needs have led to a complete re-design of the application and to the introduction of a semantic layer that can adaptively support user.

To further understand shared pain, we investigated perspective taking, bodily ownership and tooth pain sensitivity. First, participants who reported shared pain (responders) and those who did not (non-responders) viewed an avatar on a screen. Intermittently, 0-3 circles appeared. Sometimes the participant's and avatar's perspective were consistent, both directly viewed the same circles, and sometimes inconsistent, both directly viewed different circles. Responders were faster than non-responders to identify the number of circles when adopting a consistent perspective. Second, participants sat with their left hand hidden while viewing a rubber hand. All participants reported an illusory sensation of feeling stroking in the rubber hand and a sense of ownership of the rubber hand during synchronous stroking of the rubber and hidden hand. The responders also reported feeling the stroking and a sense of ownership of the rubber hand during asynchronous stroking. For experiment three, participants with either low, moderate, or high tooth sensitivity observed a series of images depicting someone eating an ice-popsicle. Low sensitivity participants never reported pain. In contrast, moderate and high sensitivity participants reported pain in response to an image depicting someone eating an ice popsicle (4 and 19% of the time, respectively) and depicting someone eating an ice-popsicle and expressing pain (23 and 40%, respectively). In summary, responders have reduced ability to distinguish their own and others' visual perspective and enhanced ability to integrate a foreign arm into their bodily representation. The tendency to share pain is also enhanced when an observed pain is commonly experienced by the observer. Shared pain may therefore when an observed pain is commonly experienced by the observer shared pain may therefore involve reactivation of pain memories or pain schema that are readily integrated into a self perspective and bodily representation.","2013-08-14","2021-02-11 04:15:59","2021-02-11 04:15:59","","","","","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND Publisher: FRONTIERS MEDIA SA Type: Article","","","","","pain; empathy; illusion; sensitivity; vicarious","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, immersive virtual reality allows people to occupy avatars that are different from them in a perceptually realistic manner. We examine how occupying an avatar with the superhero ability to fly increases helping behavior. Principal Findings: Using a two-by-two design, participants were either given the power of flight (their arm movements were tracked to control their flight akin to Superman's flying ability) or rode as a passenger in a helicopter, and were assigned one of two tasks, either to help find a missing diabetic child in need of insulin or to tour a virtual city. Participants in the “super-flight” conditions helped the experimenter pick up spilled pens after their virtual experience significantly more than those who were virtual passengers in a helicopter. Conclusion: The results indicate that having the “superpower” of flight leads to greater helping behavior in the real world, regardless of how participants used that power. A possible mechanism for this result is that having the power of flight primed concepts and prototypes associated with superheroes (e.g., Superman). This research illustrates the potential of using experiences in virtual reality technology to increase prosocial behavior in the physical world.","2013-01-30","2021-02-11 04:16:00","2021-02-11 04:16:00","","","","1","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA Publisher: PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

During the verbal exchanges in virtual reality, the virtual humans expressed acute and very strong pain. The pain reactions were identical in terms of facial expressions, and verbal and nonverbal behaviors. The Conditions by Time interactions in the repeated measures analyses of variance revealed that participants were empathic toward both virtual humans, yet more empathic toward the known virtual human.

The current experiment is the first investigating the neuronal structures responsible for differences in the occurrence of such facial mimicry reactions by simultaneously measuring BOLD and facial EMG in an MRI scanner. Therefore, 20 female students viewed emotional facial expressions (happy, sad, and angry) of male and female avatar characters. During picture presentation, the BOLD signal as well as M. zygomaticus major and M. corrugator supercilii activity were recorded simultaneously. Results show prototypical patterns of facial mimicry after correction for MR related artifacts: enhanced M. zygomaticus major activity in response to happy and enhanced M. corrugator supercilii activity in response to sad and angry expressions. Regression analyses show that these congruent facial reactions correlate significantly with activations in the IFG, SMA, and cerebellum. Stronger zygomaticus reactions to happy faces were further associated to increased activities in the caudate, MTG, and PCC. Corrugator reactions to angry expressions were further correlated with the hippocampus, insula, and STS.

Previous behavioral studies have indicated that many gamers identify more strongly with their avatar than with their biological self. Through their avatar, gamers develop social networks and learn new social-cognitive skills. The cognitive neurosciences have yet to identify the neural processes that underlie self-identification with these virtual agents. We applied functional neuroimaging to 22 long-term online gamers and 21 nongaming controls, while they rated personality traits of self, avatar, and familiar others. Strikingly, neuroimaging data revealed greater avatar-referential cortical activity in the left inferior parietal lobe, a region associated with self-identification from a third-person perspective. The magnitude of this brain activity correlated positively with the propensity to incorporate external body enhancements into one's bodily identity. Avatar-referencing furthermore recruited greater activity in the rostral anterior cingulate gyrus, suggesting relatively greater emotional self-involvement with one's avatar. Post-scanning behavioral data revealed superior recognition memory for avatar relative to others. Interestingly, memory for avatar positively covaried with play duration. These findings significantly advance our knowledge about the brain's plasticity to self-identify with virtual agents and the human cognitive-affective potential to live and learn in virtual worlds.","2012-07","2021-02-11 04:16:01","2021-02-11 04:16:01","","1577-1585","","7","22","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA Publisher: OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC Type: Article","","","","","fMRI; virtual agents; memory; new media; self-identification","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper explores student team progress and responses to roadblocks while helping a maturing Silicon Valley start-up IMVU consider the role of avatars, creative expression and social interaction in the virtual world. Our goal was to seek a deep understanding of why users choose to spend their time and money to take part in the online community IMVU all the while creating a productive entrepreneurial team atmosphere. This paper explores the unique dynamics of the research team during the evolving investigation and delivery phase, all the while simultaneously examining the underlying emotions and motives of participants in one virtual community. We start with the belief that every new research team is like a start-up company and there are commonalities or differences between the student academic research environment and the company's organizational culture. Our collaborative research team includes members from areas of engineering, design, psychology, and communication. In this paper, we intend to correlate the factors that make the design team effective, utilize the findings to guide new student teams, and facilitate progress across the stages of the project. Two factors set the stage for insights on entrepreneuring: 1) evolving research team dynamics, and 2) the need-finding interactions with users both inside and outside the industry environment studied (IMVU). Surprising discoveries include a strong gender imbalance in the community as well as users reporting that online “was basically real life.” A palette of stories abstractly parallels the student design team to the start-up they studied. Concepts include: self motivated, ambiguity readiness level, passion, and empathy. The team leader knowingly discussed using an open-process approach. Members noted a considerable lack of reluctance to prototype methods and team presentations; they also reported a deliberate lack of specific planning that they believe contributed to an entertaining and productive team ambiance.

Female research participants engaged in a 3-min interaction while immersed in a 3-D immersive virtual environment with a “peer counselor.” Participants were led to believe that the peer counselor was either an embodied agent (i.e., computer algorithm) or an avatar (i.e., another person). During the interaction, the peer counselor either smiled or not. As predicted, a digitally-rendered smile was found to affect participants' social evaluations. However, these effects were moderated by participants' beliefs about their interaction partner. Specifically, smiles enhanced social evaluations of embodied agents but degraded them for avatars. Although these results are consistent with other findings concerning the communicative realism of embodied agents and avatars they uniquely demonstrate that people's beliefs alone, rather than actual differences in virtual representations, can impact social evaluations.

We can say that these applications are entertaining games with non-entertainment goals. The idea is that games could be used for more serious purposes such as education, simulating real world phenomenon and relations in the world, increasing life quality through health, rehabilitation and therapy applications or raising interest in the problems in our global world. This paper focuses on psychology serious games. Generally, in psychology games users are represented by their avatar and can interact with the world and other game characters. Like in storytelling or bibliotherapy, the story itself has a therapeutic component so much as it evokes identification, empathy, resistance, opposition and disclosure of many confusing emotions. This goal oriented gaming can be used in goal oriented therapy methods. The game is played according to a scenario where the user can observe and react to different situations. This acts as a powerful tool for helping users understand and reflect on their own behavior and gives them the opportunity to learn from this virtual experience. The next stage is testing the user's new abilities with new situations by applying different games goals. The innovative use of computer in the form of psychotherapeutic games may enhance patient cooperation. This can also help to attract and sustain the interest especially in children. This paper describes the main features of serious games used in psychology based on the prototype of the game Mission - Master Your Fear. This is a serious game based on a specialist scenario founded on bibliotherapy with some therapeutic goals. It deals with issues and problems of preschool children. The result is an interesting and absorbing game for children which may help them solve some problems.","2011","2021-02-11 04:16:04","2021-02-11 04:16:04","","567-572","","","","","","","","","","","ACAD CONFERENCES LTD","CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND","English","","","","","","","Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>5th European Conference on Games Based Learning, Natl &amp; Kapodistrian Univ Athens, Athens, GREECE, OCT 20-21, 2011</p>","","","","goal-oriented games; informal learning; serious games in psychology","Gouscos, D and Meimaris, M","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While it would seem that physical three-dimensional objects in a gallery space, especially self-moving objects such as robots, have a distinct advantage in the reality stakes over screen images, the author suggests that there is no hard and fast distinction between how audiences respond to robotic entities and to screen-based virtual characters. It is the ability of an artwork to respond to and `dialogue' with its audienceto `look back' and `talk back'that is the key factor in making it an engaging and believable social partner. Artists discussed include Mari Velonaki, Stelarc, Ruairi Glynn, Karolina Sobecka and Golan Levin.","2010","2021-02-11 04:16:04","2021-02-11 04:16:04","","30-38","","1","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND Publisher: ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD Type: Article","","","","","phenomenology; virtual reality; robotics; art; avatars; audience interaction; audience response; media art; mirror neurons; mixed reality; new media art; virtual worlds","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
