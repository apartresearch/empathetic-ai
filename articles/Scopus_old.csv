However, progress is not always followed by ethical reflection on its consequences or scientists’ responsibility for their creations. The humanities can help health sciences students learn to critically analyse these issues; in particular, literature can aid discussions about ethical principles in biomedical research. Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein; or, the modern Prometheus (1818) is an example of a classic novel presenting complex scenarios that could be used to stimulate discussion. Main text: Within the framework of the 200th anniversary of the novel, we searched PubMed to identify works that explore and discuss its value in teaching health sciences. Our search yielded 56 articles, but only two of these reported empirical findings. Our analysis of these articles identified three main approaches to using Frankenstein in teaching health sciences: discussing the relationship between literature and science, analysing ethical issues in biomedical research, and examining the importance of empathy and compassion in healthcare and research. After a critical discussion of the articles, we propose using Frankenstein as a teaching tool to prompt students to critically analyse ethical aspects of scientific and technological progress, the need for compassion and empathy in medical research, and scientists’ responsibility for their discoveries. Conclusion: Frankenstein can help students reflect on the personal and social limits of science, the connection between curiosity and scientific progress, and scientists’ responsibilities. Its potential usefulness in teaching derives from the interconnectedness of science, ethics, and compassion. Frankenstein can be a useful tool for analysing bioethical issues related to scientific and technological advances, such as artificial intelligence, genetic engineering, and cloning. Empirical studies measuring learning outcomes are necessary to confirm the usefulness of this approach. © 2021, The Author(s).","2021","2021-04-20 16:38:27","2021-04-20 16:38:27","","","","1","22","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: BioMed Central Ltd","<p>cited By 0</p>","","","article; artificial intelligence; bioethics; empathy; empiricism; genetic engineering; human; human experiment; learning; medical research; Medline; responsibility; systematic review; teaching","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In social neuroscience, many experiments have sought to first define and then locate ‘perspective taking’, ‘empathy’, and other psychological concepts to specific brain circuits. Seldom, bottom-up studies were conducted to first identify explanatory patterns of brain variation, which are then related to psychological concepts; perhaps due to a lack of large population datasets. In this spirit, we performed a systematic de-construction of social brain morphology into its elementary building blocks, involving 10,000 UK Biobank participants. We explored coherent representations of structural co-variation at population scale within a recent social brain atlas, by translating autoencoder neural networks from deep learning. The learned subnetworks revealed essential patterns of structural relationships between social brain regions, with the nucleus accumbens, medial prefrontal cortex, and temporoparietal junction embedded at the core. Some of the uncovered subnetworks contributed to predicting examined social traits in general, while other subnetworks helped predict specific facets of social functioning, such as the experience of social isolation. As a consequence of our population-level evidence, spatially overlapping subsystems of the social brain probably relate to interindividual differences in everyday social life. © 2021, The Author(s).","2021","2021-04-20 16:38:27","2021-04-20 16:38:27","","","","1","4","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: Nature Research","<p>cited By 0</p>","","","adult; article; autoencoder; biobank; brain region; deep learning; female; human; human experiment; language; major clinical study; male; medial prefrontal cortex; nerve cell network; nucleus accumbens; social interaction; social isolation; social life; temporoparietal junction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Moreover, it is unclear whether all customers respond to the interaction with frontline service robots in the same way. Our research looks at how individual differences in social behaviors, specifically in customers' attachment styles, influence three types of customer responses: affective responses (experienced pleasantness), attitudinal responses (perceived empathy, satisfaction), and behavioral responses (word-of-mouth). Three experimental studies reveal that customers with low (vs. high) scores on anxious attachment style (AAS) measures respond more negatively to frontline service robot (compared to a frontline human agent). We investigate alternative explanations for these findings, such as robots' level of anthropomorphism and we show that human-likeness features such as voice type and level of human-like physical appearance, cannot explain our findings. Our results indicate that for low-AAS customers replacing frontline human service agent with frontline robot undermines customer attitude and behavioral responses to service robots, leading to possible implications on customer segmentation, targeting, and marketing communication. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC","2021","2021-04-20 16:38:27","2021-04-20 16:38:27","","881-895","","5","38","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: John Wiley and Sons Inc","<p>cited By 0</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Furthermore, none simulate actual peacekeeping. The United Nations currently deploys about 100,000 peacekeepers to some of the world’s most dangerous zones, where peacekeepers save lives, alleviate suffering, and help create conditions for peace. The United Nations and national militaries lack peacekeeping simulations to help train their soldiers. Additionally, the public needs to learn more about the way peacekeeping works. Thus, peacekeeping simulation and gaming are worth exploring, especially in the rapidly evolving digital space, which offers new avenues and benefits. Methods.: We review the meager literature on the subject and observe that there are few digital games to directly draw from. We build on previous work that argued the need for such development, but we now assess important design principles and parameters. We draw upon peacekeeping tabletop exercises that are already well developed. Results.: We conclude that excellent scenarios and simulation technologies exist that could be combined quite easily for effective peacekeeping training and public education. We find key materials and scenarios in exercises of the United Nations and of the Pearson Peacekeeping Centre. Highlighted areas for future digital design are the inclusion of non-military avatars, emphasis on soft skills development (especially empathy), and realistically complex links between actions and consequences. Conclusion.: While describing some UN exploration at a proof-of-concept stage, we suggest that both the United Nations and the gaming industry should explore the idea further to achieve synergies between institutional and entertainment applications. The growing capacity of digital technology allows significant innovation, yielding results that could be useful, ethical, enjoyable, and potentially profitable. © 2020 SAGE Publications.","2021","2021-04-20 16:38:27","2021-04-20 16:38:27","","226-242","","2","52","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: SAGE Publications Inc.","<p>cited By 0</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The interactive robot actively engaged the participant in a conversation before, during and after a collaborative task whereas the non-interactive robot remained passive. The robots' nonverbal and verbal interactions increased participants' perception of the robot as a social actor and strengthened bonding and relationship building between human and robot. The results of our study indicate that the evaluation of the collaboration improves when the robot maintains eye contact, the robot is attributed a certain personality, and the robot is perceived as being alive.

This study investigates if a robot pet can, like a real pet, induce helpers high in people interacting with it. A Vector robot was programmed to express the need for daily exercise and attention, and participants were instructed how to help the robot meet those needs. Our within subjects design had two conditions: with and without emotional behaviour modifiers to the robot's behaviour. Our primary research question is whether behaviours that conveyed emotion as well as needs would lead to empathy in the participants, which would create a stronger helper's high effect than purely functional need expression behaviours. We present a long-term (4 day) remote study design that not only facilitates the kind of interactions needed for helper's high, but abides by government guidelines on Covid-19 safety (under which a laboratory study is not possible). Preliminary results suggest that Vector was able to improve the mood of some participants, and mood changes tend to be greater when Vector expressed behaviours with emotional components. Our post-study interview data suggests that individual differences in living environment and mood impacting external factors, affected Vector's efficacy in mood influencing. © 2021 ACM.","2021","2021-04-20 16:38:28","2021-04-20 16:38:28","","229-233","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Computer Society","","English","","","","","","","ISSN: 21672148","<p>cited By 0; Conference of 2021 ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction, HRI 2021 ; Conference Date: 8 March 2021 Through 11 March 2021; Conference Code:167645</p>","","","Agricultural robots; External factors; Human robot interaction; Individual Differences; Laboratory studies; Living environment; Machine design; Man machine systems; Purely functional; Research questions; Study design; Vectors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, I argue that the AI rights research program is beset by an epistemic problem that threatens to impede its progress—namely, a lack of a solution to the ‘Hard Problem’ of consciousness: the problem of explaining why certain brain states give rise to experience. To motivate this claim, I consider three ways in which to ground AI rights—namely: superintelligence, empathy, and a capacity for consciousness. I argue that appeals to superintelligence and empathy are problematic, and that consciousness should be our central focus, as in the case of animal rights. However, I also argue that AI rights is disanalogous from animal rights in an important respect: animal rights can proceed without a solution to the ‘Hard Problem’ of consciousness. Not so with AI rights, I argue. There we cannot make the same kinds of assumptions that we do about animal consciousness, since we still do not understand why brain states give rise to conscious mental states in humans. © 2020, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","2021","2021-04-20 16:38:28","2021-04-20 16:38:28","","19-32","","1","36","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","<p>cited By 0</p>","","","Animal rights; Animals; Brain state; Hard problems; Mental state; Moral concerns; Research programs; Superintelligence","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One such approach involves asking participants to inflict ‘harm’ on a robot. Researchers are interested in the length of time between the experimenter issuing the instruction and the participant complying, and propose that relatively long periods of hesitation might reflect empathy for the robot, and perhaps even attribution of human-like qualities, such as agency and sentience. In a recent experiment, we adapted the so-called ‘hesitance to hit’ paradigm, in which participants were instructed to hit a humanoid robot on the head with a mallet. After standing up to do so (signaling intent to hit the robot), participants were stopped, and then took part in a semi-structured interview to probe their thoughts and feelings during the period of hesitation. Thematic analysis of the responses indicate that hesitation not only reflects perceived socialness, but also other factors including (but not limited to) concerns about cost, mallet disbelief, processing of the task instruction, and the influence of authority. The open-ended, free responses participants provided also offer rich insights into individual differences with regards to anthropomorphism, perceived power imbalances, and feelings of connection toward the robot. In addition to aiding understanding of this measurement technique and related topics regarding socialness attribution to robots, we argue that greater use of open questions can lead to exciting new research questions and interdisciplinary collaborations in the domain of social robotics. © Copyright © 2021 Riddoch and Cross.","2021","2021-04-20 16:38:28","2021-04-20 16:38:28","","","","","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: Frontiers Media S.A.","<p>cited By 0</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Goal conflicts can arise from simple trajectory planning to complex task prioritization. For successful human-robot goal-conflict resolution, humans and robots need to negotiate their goals and priorities. For this, the robot might be equipped with effective conflict resolution strategies to be assertive and effective but similarly accepted by the user. In this paper, conflict resolution strategies for service robots (public cleaning robot, home assistant robot) are developed by transferring psychological concepts (e.g., negotiation, cooperation) to HRI. Altogether, fifteen strategies were grouped by the expected affective outcome (positive, neutral, negative). In two online experiments, the acceptability of and compliance with these conflict resolution strategies were tested with humanoid and mechanic robots in two application contexts (public: n1 = 61; private: n2 = 93). To obtain a comparative value, the strategies were also applied by a human. As additional outcomes trust, fear, arousal, and valence, as well as perceived politeness of the agent were assessed. The positive/neutral strategies were found to be more acceptable and effective than negative strategies. Some negative strategies (i.e., threat, command) even led to reactance and fear. Some strategies were only positively evaluated and effective for certain agents (human or robot) or only acceptable in one of the two application contexts (i.e., approach, empathy). Influences on strategy acceptance and compliance in the public context could be found: acceptance was predicted by politeness and trust. Compliance was predicted by interpersonal power. Taken together, psychological conflict resolution strategies can be applied in HRI to enhance robot task effectiveness. If applied robot-specifically and context-sensitively they are accepted by the user. The contribution of this paper is twofold: conflict resolution strategies based on Human Factors and Social Psychology are introduced and empirically evaluated in two online studies for two application contexts. Influencing factors and requirements for the acceptance and effectiveness of robot assertiveness are discussed. © Copyright © 2021 Babel, Kraus and Baumann.","2021","2021-04-20 16:38:28","2021-04-20 16:38:28","","","","","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: Frontiers Media S.A.","<p>cited By 0</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous neuroimaging studies have indicated that neural responses of empathy for others' pain are modulated by an early automatic emotional sharing and a late controlled cognitive evaluation process. Recent studies about pain empathy for robots found humans present similar empathy process towards humanoid robots under painful stimuli as well as to humans. However, the whole-brain functional connectivity and the spatial dynamics of neural activities underlying empathic processes are still unknown. In the present study, the functional connectivity was investigated for ERPs recorded from 18 healthy adults who were presented with pictures of human hand and robot hand under painful and non-painful situations. Functional brain networks for both early and late empathy responses were constructed and a new parameter, empathy index (EI), was proposed to represent the empathy ability of humans quantitatively. We found that the mutual dependences between early ERP components was significantly decreased, but for the late components, there were no significant changes. The mutual dependences for human hand stimuli were larger than to robot hand stimuli for early components, but not for late components. The connectivity weights for early components were larger than late components. EI value shows significant difference between painful and non-painful stimuli, indicating it is a good indicator to represent the empathy of humans. This study enriches our understanding of the neurological mechanisms implicated in human empathy, and provides evidence of functional connectivity for both early and late responses of pain empathy towards humans and robots. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","2021","2021-04-20 16:38:28","2021-04-20 16:38:28","","","","","151","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>cited By 0</p>","","","adult; Article; brain region; electroencephalogram; empathy; event related potential; female; functional connectivity; hand pain; human; human experiment; male; normal human; pain empathy; pain threshold; reaction time; robotics; stimulus response; young adult","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

But the fact that the term ‘empathy’ has strong social connotations raises a question: can it be applied to robots? Can we actually use social terms and explanations in relation to these inanimate machines? In this article, I analyse the range of uses of the term empathy in the field of HRI studies and social robotics, and consider the substantial, functional and relational positions on this issue. I focus on the relational (cooperational) perspective presented by Luisa Damiano and Paul Dumouchel, who interpret emotions (together with empathy) as being the result of affective coordination. I also reflect on the criteria that should be used to determine when, in such relations, we are dealing with actual empathy. © 2021, The Author(s).","2021","2021-04-20 16:38:28","2021-04-20 16:38:28","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: Springer Science and Business Media B.V.","<p>cited By 0</p>","","","Artificial intelligence; Philosophical aspects; Robot interactions; Social relationships; Social robotics; Social robots","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Biases in training data coupled with algorithmic biases adversely affect many stakeholders. It has been shown that AI based decisions exhibit discrimination based on sensitive attributes such as age, gender, and race, to name a few. One of the ways of addressing this issue is by incorporating the voices of people impacted by AI into the AI pipeline. However, historical power structures and impacts of discrimination against specific communities worldwide poses several challenges. Towards this end, art shows tremendous promise as a powerful platform to promote AI education, as a medium of expression, and to enhance empathy; thereby facilitating diversity and inclusion in the AI pipeline. In this work, we highlight some emerging work in this area, discuss pathways that art offers towards enhancing AI ethics, and outline some open research directions. We hope our work serves as a prequel to discussions concerning the design and development of tools that leverage art in an effort towards enhancing AI ethics.

Humans assess the behavior and personality of their counterparts to adapt their behavior and show empathy to flourish human-human interaction. Similarly, assessment of human personality is highly critical in realizing natural and intelligent human-robot interaction. Numerous personality traits assessment systems have been reported in the literature; however, most of them target the big five personality traits. From only visual information, this work proposes to use pleasure, arousal, and dominance emotional space for the assessment of personality traits based on the work of Mehrabian. To validate the system, three different scenarios have been developed to assess 12 different personality traits on a social humanoid robot. Experimental results show that the system can assess human personality traits with 84% accuracy in real-time and, hence, it can adapt its behavior according to the perceived personality of the interaction partner.

EI, and its component, can be improved with training, but currently the process is less flexible and very time-consuming. Machine learning (ML), on the other hand, can analyse huge amount of data to discover useful trends and patterns in shortest time possible. Despite the benefits, ML usage in EI training is scarce. In this paper, we studied 92 journal articles to discover the trend of the ML utilisation in the study of EI and its components. This survey aims to pave way for future studies that could lead to implementation of ML in EI training, and to rope in researchers in psychology and computer science to find possibilities of having a generic ML algorithm for every EI’s components. Our findings show an increasing trend to apply ML on EI components, and Support Vector Machine and Neural Network are the two most popular ML algorithms used in those researches. We also found that social skill and empathy are the least exposed EI components to ML.

Near future social AIs, including social robots, will give us this experience without possessing any subjectivity of their own. They will also be consumer products, designed to be subservient instruments of their users' satisfaction. This would seem inevitable. Yet we cannot live as personal when caught between instrumentalizing apparent persons (slaveholding) or numbly dismissing the apparent personalities of our instruments (mild sociopathy). This paper analyzes and proposes a step toward ameliorating this dilemma by way of the thought of a 5th century North African philosopher and theologian, Augustine of Hippo, who is among those essential in giving us our understanding of relational persons. Augustine's semiotics, deeply intertwined with our affective life, suggest that, if we are to own persuasive social robots humanely, we must join our instinctive experience of empathy for them to an empathic acknowledgment of the real unknown relational persons whose emails, text messages, books, and bodily movements will have provided the training data for the behavior of near-future social AIs. So doing, we may see simulation as simulation (albeit persuasive), while expanding our empathy to include those whose refracted behavioral moments are the seedbed of this simulation. If we naïvely stop at the social robot as the ultimate object of our cognitive and affective empathy, we will suborn the sign to ourselves, undermining rather than sustaining a culture that prizes empathy and abhors the instrumentalization of persons. © 2020 The authors and IOS Press.

In human social interaction, the facial expression serves important communicative functions. We examined whether a robot’s face is similarly important in human-robot communication. Based on emotion research and neuropsychological insights on the parallel processing of emotions, we argue that greater plasticity in the robot’s face elicits higher affective responsivity, more closely resembling human-to-human responsiveness than a more static face. We conducted a between-subjects experiment of 3 (facial plasticity: human vs. facially flexible robot vs. facially static robot) × 2 (treatment: affectionate vs. maltreated). Participants (N = 265; Mage = 31.5) were measured for their emotional responsiveness, empathy, and attribution of feelings to the robot. Results showed empathically and emotionally less intensive responsivity toward the robots than toward the human but followed similar patterns. Significantly different intensities of feelings and attributions (e.g., pain upon maltreatment) followed facial articulacy. Theoretical implications for underlying processes in human-robot communication are discussed. We theorize that precedence of emotion and affect over cognitive reflection, which are processed in parallel, triggers the experience of ‘because I feel, I believe it’s real,’ despite being aware of communicating with a robot. By evoking emotional responsiveness, the cognitive awareness of ‘it is just a robot’ fades into the background and appears not relevant anymore. © 2020 by the authors.

The epistemological approach helps us to clarify whether we can empathize with artificial intelligence or, more precisely, with social robots. The main puzzle here concerns, among other things, exactly what it is that we empathize with if robots do not have emotions or beliefs, since they do not have a consciousness in an elaborate sense. However, by comparing robots with fictional characters, the paper shows that we can still empathize with robots and that many of the existing accounts of empathy and mindreading are compatible with such a view. By so doing, the paper focuses on the significance of perspective-taking and claims that we also ascribe to robots something like a perspectival experience. The normative approach examines the moral impact of empathizing with robots. In this regard, the paper critically discusses three possible responses: strategic, anti-barbarizational, and pragmatist. The latter position is defended by stressing that we are increasingly compelled to interact with robots in a shared world and that to take robots into our moral consideration should be seen as an integral part of our self- and other-understanding. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","2020","2021-04-20 16:38:29","2021-04-20 16:38:29","","881-897","","4","11","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: Springer Science and Business Media B.V.","<p>cited By 0</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Persons affected by this condition are unable to verbally describe their feelings. For many years this condition was relatively little known, but nowadays people are talking about it more and more. In forums in which the patients’ comments are posted, it is often underscored how this particular mental state is similar to that of the androids described in the novel Do androids dream of electric sheep? by Philip K. Dick. The Dickian clinical references were those in use during the 1960s. Therefore, to special characteristics that Philip Dick attributed to his robots (coldness and lack of human empathy, and simultaneous desire for social acceptance), the writer, and then the critics, assigned the label of schizophrenia, the only one that the psychiatric manuals of that time associated to such symptoms. Today, if Dick were alive and were to write about his androids, he most likely would no longer use the term schizophrenics, but instead the term alexithymics, which are more socially adaptive than schizophrenics, just like his androids. Making retrospective diagnoses of literary characters is anachronistic; as it was done for decades by critics to consider the Dickian androids schizophrenics: in the fiction story they are not schizophrenics but robots. However a new psychological trait such as alexithymia can revisit that same story by giving it a new symbolic meaning. The aims of this article are: to highlight how the old nosological categories of schizophrenia, generally referred to when commenting Do androids dream of electric sheep?, should be supplemented by the category of alexithymia; to analyze the scenes in which the characters have typical alexithymic behaviors, trying to prove that alexithymia is actually best suited for describing the androids invented by Dick. © 2020, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.","2020","2021-04-20 16:38:29","2021-04-20 16:38:29","","673-683","","2","47","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: Springer Science and Business Media B.V.","<p>cited By 0</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Robotic interventions have been explored for use with ASD children worldwide revealing that robots encourage one-to-one social and emotional interactions. However, associations between interpersonal synchronisation and emotional empathy have not yet been directly explored in French and Japanese ASD children when they interact with a human or a robot under analogous experimental conditions. Using the paradigm of actor-perceiver, where the child was the actor and the robot or the human the perceiver, we recorded the autonomic heart rate activation and reported emotional feelings of ASD children in both countries. Japanese and French ASD children showed different interpersonal synchronisation when they interacted with the human perceiver, even though the human was the same in both countries. However, they exhibited similar interpersonal synchronisation when the perceiver was the robot. The findings suggest that the mechanism combining interpersonal synchronisation and emotional empathy might be weakened but not absent in ASD children and that both French and Japanese ASD children do spontaneously and unconsciously discern non verbal actions of non human partners through a direct matching process that occurs via automatic mapping. © 2020, The Author(s).","2020","2021-04-20 16:38:29","2021-04-20 16:38:29","","","","1","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: Nature Research","<p>cited By 0</p>","","","autism; Autism Spectrum Disorder; child; Child; female; Female; heart rate; Heart Rate; human; human relation; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; male; Male; pathophysiology; Preschool; preschool child; robotics; Robotics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Evidence indicates that OT effects on human behavior are multifaceted, such as trust behavior, decrease anxiety, empathy and bonding behavior. For the vital role of mentalizing in understanding others, here we examine whether OT has a general effect on mentalizing brain network which is associated to the effect of related social behavioral and personality traits. Using a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled group design, we investigate the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging after intranasal OT or placebo. The functional connectivity (FC) maps with seed in left/right temporoparietal junction (lTPJ/rTPJ) showed that OT significantly increased connectivity between rTPJ and default attention network (DAN), but decreased the FC between lTPJ and medial prefrontal network (MPN). With machine learning approach, we report that identified altered FCs of TPJ can classify OT and placebo (PL) group. Moreover, individual’s empathy trait can modulate the FC between left TPJ and right rectus (RECT), which shows a positive correlation with empathic concern in PL group but a negative correlation in OT group. These results demonstrate that OT has significant effect on FC with lTPJ and rTPJ, brain regions where are critical for mentalizing, and the empathy concern can modulate the FC. These findings advance our understanding of the neural mechanisms by which OT modulates social behaviors, especially in social interaction involving mentalizing. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","2020","2021-04-20 16:38:29","2021-04-20 16:38:29","","2530-2541","","6","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: Springer","<p>cited By 3</p>","","","Administration; adult; Article; attention network; behavior; brain; Brain; brain region; college student; controlled study; default mode network; diagnostic imaging; dorsal attention network; double blind procedure; Double-Blind Method; empathy; frontoparietal network; functional connectivity; functional magnetic resonance imaging; functional neuroimaging; human; human experiment; Humans; inferior frontal gyrus; inferior parietal lobule; Intranasal; intranasal drug administration; machine learning; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; male; medial prefrontal cortex; mentalization; Mentalization; mentalizing network; nerve cell network; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; oxytocin; Oxytocin; personality; precuneus; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; resting state network; sensitivity and specificity; social behavior; social interaction; temporoparietal junction; ventral attention network; young adult","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The effective service can be obtained through smooth, engaged, and humanoid interactions in which robots react properly to a user's affective state. This article proposes a novel Automatic Cognitive Empathy Model, ACEM, for humanoid robots to achieve longer and more engaged human-robot interactions (HRI) by considering humans' emotions and replying to them appropriately. The proposed model continuously detects the affective states of a user based on facial expressions and generates desired, either parallel or reactive, empathic behaviors that are already adapted to the user's personality.

In this work, we aim to examine AI roles in early design stages. The human ideation components and design tools related to AI are discussed in a framework of AI-augmented design support. The framework develops a hierarchy of design cognition (basis), approaches and principles. The cognitive models are constructed in an empirical study of 30 designers (26 for analysis, 4 for pilot study) by concurrent Think-Aloud protocol and behavior analysis. The process of producing new design ideas is explained by a transparent analysis of designers’ language and behaviors. Three strategies to organize cognitive activities in design ideation are summarized: develop structured consideration, relate to a scenario, and stick-to designing. These strategies suggest AI could act as (1) representation creation, (2) empathy trigger and (3) engagement, in principles of “knowledge-driven” and “decompose-and-integrate”. The design support with AI provides new perspectives on computer-based design tools that limit to well-defined design variables. The framework is built on a generic notion of design activity and “mimic” human design rationales, expected to benefit research of domain-independent computational design supports and cognitive supports. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","2020","2021-04-20 16:38:30","2021-04-20 16:38:30","","511-544","","5-6","35","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: Taylor and Francis Inc.","<p>cited By 0</p>","","","Artificial intelligence; Behavior analysis; Cognitive activities; Computational design supports; Computer aided design; Computer based designs; Domain independents; Early design stages; Empirical studies; Think-aloud protocol","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Materials and Methods: Co-design workshops with general practitioners were conducted. The workshops focused on (1) understanding the current consultation context and identifying existing problems, (2) ideating future solutions to these problems, and (3) discussing future roles for AI in primary care. The workshop activities included affinity diagramming, brainwriting, and video prototyping methods. The workshops were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Inductive thematic analysis of the transcripts of conversations was performed. Results: Two researchers facilitated 3 co-design workshops with 16 general practitioners. Three main themes emerged: professional autonomy, human-AI collaboration, and new models of care. Major implications identified within these themes included (1) concerns with medico-legal aspects arising from constant recording and accessibility of full consultation records, (2) future consultations taking place out of the exam rooms in a distributed system involving empowered patients, (3) human conversation and empathy remaining the core tasks of doctors in any future AI-enabled consultations, and (4) questioning the current focus of AI initiatives on improved efficiency as opposed to patient care. Conclusions: AI documentation assistants will likely to be integral to the future primary care consultations. However, these technologies will still need to be supervised by a human until strong evidence for reliable autonomous performance is available. Therefore, different human-AI collaboration models will need to be designed and evaluated to ensure patient safety, quality of care, doctor safety, and doctor autonomy. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

Here we tested the effects of some socio-cognitive variables that could contribute to enhancing or reducing the implicit racial bias. The first aim of the study was to assess the beneficial effects of cooperation within a VR scenario, the second aim was to provide preliminary testing of the hypothesis that empathy and political attitudes could contribute to implicit bias about race, while the third aim was to explore the relationship between political attitudes and empathy. We had (Caucasian) participants embodied in a Black virtual body and engaged either in a cooperative (Coop group) or in a non-cooperative (Neutral group) activity with a confederate experimenter embodying another Black avatar. Before and after VR, we measured participants’ implicit racial bias by means of Implicit Association Test (IAT) and their perceived closeness toward the confederate experimenter. Before VR we also assessed participants’ political attitudes and empathy traits. Results revealed that, as compared to the Neutral group, the Coop group showed lower IAT scores after the social interaction. Interestingly, in the Neutral but not the Coop group the perceived closeness toward the confederate experimenter was associated with the initial racial bias: the more the participants reduced their distance, the more they reduced their IAT score. Moreover, reported traits of empathy and political attitudes significantly explained the variance observed in the initial implicit bias, with perspective-taking, empathic concern, and personal distress being significant predictors of the IAT scores. Finally, there was a relationship between political attitudes and empathy: the more participants considered themselves as left-wing voters, the higher their perspective-taking and empathic concern scores. We discuss these findings within the neuroscientific and social cognition field and encourage scholars from different domains to further explore whether and under which conditions a given manipulation for reducing racial bias could be efficiently transposed in VR. © Copyright © 2020 Patané, Lelgouarch, Banakou, Verdelet, Desoche, Koun, Salemme, Slater and Farnè.","2020","2021-04-20 16:38:30","2021-04-20 16:38:30","","","","","11","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: Frontiers Media S.A.","<p>cited By 0</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The capacity for artificial intelligence (AI) to be inequitable or harmful is well documented, yet it's an issue that continues to lack apparent urgency or effective mitigation. The question we raise in this paper is how to prepare future generations to recognize and grapple with the ethical concerns of a range of issues plaguing AI, particularly when they are combined with surveillance technologies in ways that have grave implications for social participation and restriction?from risk assessment and bail assignment in criminal justice, to public benefits distribution and access to housing and other critical resources that enable security and success within society. The US is a mecca of information and computer science (IS and CS) learning for Asian students whose experiences as minorities renders them familiar with, and vulnerable to, the societal bias that feeds AI bias. Our goal was to better understand how students who are being educated to design AI systems think about these issues, and in particular, their sensitivity to intersectional considerations that heighten risk for vulnerable groups. In this paper we report on findings from qualitative interviews with 20 graduate students, 11 from an AI class and 9 from a Data Mining class. We find that students are not predisposed to think deeply about the implications of AI design for the privacy and well-being of others unless explicitly encouraged to do so. When they do, their thinking is focused through the lens of personal identity and experience, but their reflections tend to center on bias, an intrinsic feature of design, rather than on fairness, an outcome that requires them to imagine the consequences of AI. While they are, in fact, equipped to think about fairness when prompted by discussion and by design exercises that explicitly invite consideration of intersectionality and structural inequalities, many need help to do this empathy 'work.' Notably, the students who more frequently reflect on intersectional problems related to bias and fairness are also more likely to consider the connection between model attributes and bias, and the interaction with context. Our findings suggest that experience with identity-based vulnerability promotes more analytically complex thinking about AI, lending further support to the argument that identity-related ethics should be integrated into IS and CS curriculums, rather than positioned as a stand-alone course. © 2020 ACM.","2020","2021-04-20 16:38:30","2021-04-20 16:38:30","","","","CSCW2","4","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","<p>cited By 0</p>","","","Artificial intelligence; Benefits distribution; Critical resources; Data mining; Future generations; Information and computer science; Intrinsic features; Philosophical aspects; Privacy by design; Qualitative interviews; Risk assessment; Social participation; Students; Surveillance technology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Human-like empathy is considered as an emergent behavior based on social interaction with humans, gut feelings, mirroring system, and association between external stimuli and emotions in the developmental robotics theory. Our study uses developmental robotics theory and it presents a simulation of the internal emotional states of an agent/robot. Furthermore, our study demonstrates a model of the changes of the affective state of the robot from one emotion to another, in synchronization with the emotions expressed by its human partner. The robot can adjust its inner state and mood in harmony to the emotional state of the human partner after training.

However, a proper integration of IHRs requires a detailed description and explanation of their essential capabilities, particularly regarding their competencies in replicating and portraying emotive functions such as empathy. Existing humanoid robots can exhibit rudimentary forms of empathy; as these machines slowly become commonplace in healthcare settings, they will be expected to express empathy as a natural function, rather than merely to portray artificial empathy as a replication of human empathy. This article works with a twofold purpose: firstly, to consider the impact of artificial empathy in nursing and, secondly, to describe the influence of Affective Developmental Robotics (ADR) in anticipation of the empathic behaviour presented by artificial humanoid robots. The ADR has demonstrated that it can be one means by which humanoid nurse robots can achieve expressions of more relatable artificial empathy. This will be one of the vital models for intelligent humanoid robots currently in nurse robot development for the healthcare industry.

Hundreds of genetic variants are expected to influence its complex development, but few have been identified. We used a machine learning method for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to uncover complex genotypic–phenotypic networks and environmental interactions. The Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) measured the self-regulatory components of personality critical for health (i.e., the character traits of self-directedness, cooperativeness, and self-transcendence). In a discovery sample of 2149 healthy Finns, we identified sets of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that cluster within particular individuals (i.e., SNP sets) regardless of phenotype. Second, we identified five clusters of people with distinct profiles of character traits regardless of genotype. Third, we found 42 SNP sets that identified 727 gene loci and were significantly associated with one or more of the character profiles. Each character profile was related to different SNP sets with distinct molecular processes and neuronal functions. Environmental influences measured in childhood and adulthood had small but significant effects. We confirmed the replicability of 95% of the 42 SNP sets in healthy Korean and German samples, as well as their associations with character. The identified SNPs explained nearly all the heritability expected for character in each sample (50 to 58%). We conclude that self-regulatory personality traits are strongly influenced by organized interactions among more than 700 genes despite variable cultures and environments. These gene sets modulate specific molecular processes in brain for intentional goal-setting, self-reflection, empathy, and episodic learning and memory. © 2018, The Author(s).","2020","2021-04-20 16:38:31","2021-04-20 16:38:31","","2295-2312","","10","25","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: Springer Nature","<p>cited By 23</p>","","","80 and over; adolescent; Adolescent; adult; Adult; adulthood; aged; Aged; article; brain; character; Character; child; Child; childhood; cooperation; empathy; female; Finland; Finn (citizen); gene locus; gene mutation; genetic association; genetic polymorphism; genetics; genome-wide association study; Genome-Wide Association Study; genotype; Germany; heritability; human; human experiment; Humans; individuality; Individuality; machine learning; major clinical study; male; memory; middle aged; Middle Aged; phenotype; Polymorphism; Preschool; preschool child; Republic of Korea; self transcendence; Single Nucleotide; single nucleotide polymorphism; South Korea; temperament; Temperament; very elderly; young adult; Young Adult","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our approach is motivated by the notion that in many cultures, trust-building can be boosted by small body gestures. We discuss the integration of a robot capable of such movements within CRECA, our context-respectful counseling agent. The frequent nodding called “unazuki” in Japan, often accompanying the “un-un” sound (meaning “I agree”) of Japanese onomatopoeia, underlines empathy and embodies unconditioned approval. We argue that “unazuki” creates more empathy and promotes longer conversation between the robotic counsellor and people. We set up an experiment involving ten subjects to verify these effects. Our quantitative evaluation is based on the classic metrics of utterance, adapted to support the Japanese language. Interactions featuring “unazuki” showed higher value of this metrics. Moreover, subjects assessed the counselling robot’s trustworthiness and kindness as “very high” (Likert scale: 5.5 versus 3—4.5) showing the effect of social gestures in promoting empathetic dialogue to general people including the younger generation. Our findings support the importance of social movements when using robotized agents as a therapeutic tool aimed at improving emotional state and social interactions, with unambiguous evidence that embodiment can have a positive impact that warrants further exploration. The 3D printable design of our robot supports creating culture-specific libraries of social movements, adapting the gestural repertoire to different human cultures. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","2020","2021-04-20 16:38:31","2021-04-20 16:38:31","","129-139","","3","6","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","<p>cited By 0</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Data collection was performed in two stages, pilot research based on 82 respondents and the main study, with the final number of respondents being 236. The initial results of the exploratory factor analysis were further tested using the confirmatory factor analysis. After the exclusion of several items due to low factor loadings and in order to improve model validity, analyses further suggested a nine-dimensional solution with 45 items. The study findings reveal a positive relationship between seven constructs and students’ willingness to implement service robots, with the expected business outcome being the most influencing one. On the other hand, positive relation was not found for empathy and social influence constructs. Theoretical contributions and practical implications are discussed in the paper. In conclusion, study limitations and future research suggestions are provided. © 2020 by the authors.

Over the past 200 years, popular culture has considered the imaginary consequences of the danger to humanity and human-ness of replicating the autonomous human form too faithfully. Today, the seductive allure of technologically advanced simulated human bodies and advances in robotics and artificial intelligence has brought us closer to facing this possibility. Alongside the simultaneous aversion and fascination of the possibility that autonomous simulated human forms may become indistinguishable from human beings is the deep-rooted uncanniness of the automaton in its strange familiarity – not only to ourselves but to our pleasant childhood imaginings of playing with dolls. As such, simulated human bodies are often enrolled in medical and nursing education models with the assumption that making the simulation teaching spaces seem as close to clinical spaces as possible will allow students to practise potentially harmful clinical skills without causing any harm to human patients. However similar the simulated human bodies may appear to a living, breathing human, a tension between the embodiment of particularly human attributes and their replication persists. How can computerized human patient simulators be enrolled to teach people to develop the necessary attributes of compassion and empathy when caring for human beings? This article explores the uncanny ecologies of simulated human patients in nursing education by presenting a posthuman analysis of the practices of nurse educators as they enrol these digital objects in their teaching. Guided by a selection of heuristics offered as a mode of interviewing digital objects, the analysis enrolled ‘Gathering Anecdotes’ and ‘Unravelling Translations’ to attune to the ways in which these uncanny posthuman assemblages become powerful modes of knowing to mobilize learning about human attributes within uncanny posthuman ecologies. © 2020 Intellect Ltd Article.","2020","2021-04-20 16:38:31","2021-04-20 16:38:31","","299-318","","3","19","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: Intellect Ltd.","<p>cited By 1</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Users, on a restaurant guide site, utilize IDs to post their recommendation articles on restaurants, and these posted articles are a valuable information source for other users. Open users can search for restaurants and read recommendation articles posted by other users. Furthermore, they can react (e.g., “like”) to a recommendation article when they feel it is helpful or they feel like visiting the restaurant. On a target restaurant guide site, each post includes the user ID, restaurant name, recommendation sentences, etc., and the number of reactions is considered to depend on these posted contents. For users who post recommendation articles, the number of reactions to their posts represents the degree of empathy from other users and is an important motivation for posting. Therefore, posting users will benefit from guidelines on how to write good recommendation sentences to increase the number of reactions. Moreover, the number of reactions can be regarded as an important indicator of the activity level of the restaurant guide site from the viewpoint of the service operating company. Therefore, an analytical model developed using historical information such as posts and reactions by users would be useful for determining the relationship between posted contents and the number of reactions. Therefore, this paper proposes a model based on the machine learning approach to analyze the relation between the number of reactions and posted contents. Finally, we demonstrate the analysis based on the proposed model using practical data. © 2020 KIIE","2020","2021-04-20 16:38:31","2021-04-20 16:38:31","","669-679","","3","19","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: Korean Institute of Industrial Engineers","<p>cited By 0</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, inappropriate communication of self- tracking results might cause the opposite effect. Subtle self- tracking feedback is an alternative that can be provided with the aid of an artificial agent representing the self. Hence, we propose a wearable pet that reflects the user's affective states through visual and haptic feedback. By eliciting empathy and fostering helping behaviors towards it, users would indirectly help themselves. A wearable prototype was built, and three user studies performed to evaluate the appropriateness of the proposed affective representations. Visual representations using facial and body cues were clear for valence and less clear for arousal. Haptic interoceptive patterns emulating heart-rate levels matched the desired feedback urgency levels with a saturation frequency. The integrated visuo-haptic representations matched to participants own affective experience. From the results, we derived three design guidelines for future robot mirroring wearable systems: physical embodiment, interoceptive feedback, and customization. © 2020 IEEE.","2020","2021-04-20 16:38:31","2021-04-20 16:38:31","","1328-1333","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","","","","","","<p>cited By 0; Conference of 29th IEEE International Conference on Robot and Human Interactive Communication, RO-MAN 2020 ; Conference Date: 31 August 2020 Through 4 September 2020; Conference Code:164066</p>","","","Affective representations; Affective state; Agricultural robots; Artificial agents; Haptic feedbacks; Machine design; Social robots; Undesired behavior; Visual representations; Wearable prototypes; Wearable systems; Wearable technology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This dialogue strategy can improve the sense of conversation, which results in increased interest while avoiding the privacy issue. We examined our proposal by conducting a conversation experiment evaluated by subject impressions. The results demonstrated that the proposed method could help the robot to obtain higher evaluations.

In this paper, via structural equation modelling (SEM) and semi-structured interviews with managers, we conceptualise and empirically test visitors' intentions to use social robots in hospitality services. With data collected in Singapore's hospitality settings, we found visitors' intentions to use social robots stem from the effects of technology acceptance variables, service quality dimensions leading to perceived value, and two further dimensions from human robot interaction (HRI): empathy and information sharing.

Unfair reviews, created when requesters consider factors outside of a worker's control, are known to plague gig workers and can result in lost job opportunities and even termination from the marketplace. Our tool leverages machine learning to implement an intelligent interface that: (1) uses deep learning to automatically detect when an individual has included unfair factors into her review (factors outside the worker's control per the policies of the market); and (2) prompts the individual to reconsider her review if she has incorporated unfair factors. To study the effectiveness of Reputation Agent, we conducted a controlled experiment over different gig markets. Our experiment illustrates that across markets, Reputation Agent, in contrast with traditional approaches, motivates requesters to review gig workers' performance more fairly. We discuss how tools that bring more transparency to employers about the policies of a gig market can help build empathy thus resulting in reasoned discussions around potential injustices towards workers generated by these interfaces.

In recent years, the quest for greater efficiency in health care, including economic efficiency, has often resulted in the side-lining of these values, making it difficult for health-care professionals to incorporate them in practice. Artificial intelligence is increasingly being used in health care. This technology promises greater efficiency and more free time for health-care professionals to focus on the human side of care, including fostering trust relationships and engaging with patients with empathy and compassion. This article considers the vision of efficient, empathetic and trustworthy health care put forward by the proponents of artificial intelligence. The paper suggests that artificial intelligence has the potential to fundamentally alter the way in which empathy, compassion and trust are currently regarded and practised in health care.

The assessment of our psychological traits is a useful tool when we require them to simulate empathy. Since the creation of social media platforms, numerous studies dealt with measuring personality traits by gathering users' information from their social media profiles. Real world applications showed how natural language processing combined with supervised machine learning algorithms are effective in this field. These applications have some limitations such as focusing on English text only and not considering polysemy in text. In this paper, we propose a multilingual model that handles polysemy by analyzing sentences as a semantic ensemble of interconnected words. The proposed approach processes Facebook posts from the myPersonality dataset and it turns them into a high-dimensional array of features, which are then exploited by a deep neural network architecture based on transformer to perform regression. We prove the effectiveness of our work by comparing the mean squared error of our model with existing baselines and the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the relative data distributions. We obtained state-of-the-art results in personality traits estimation from social media posts for all five personality traits. © 2020 by the authors.","2020","2021-04-20 16:38:32","2021-04-20 16:38:32","","","","4","11","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: MDPI AG","<p>cited By 0</p>","","","Data distribution; Deep neural networks; High-dimensional; Intelligent agents; Kullback Leibler divergence; Learning algorithms; Mean square error; Mean squared error; NAtural language processing; Natural language processing systems; Network architecture; Personality traits; Semantics; Social media platforms; Social networking (online); Supervised learning; Supervised machine learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, these techniques are less proven in sparse-data environments, and at present are more the subject of research than application. Typical implementations of ML and AI require a cross-disciplinary decision engine that, once 'trained,' can cognitively respond to changes in input. The key to successful training is to a) have a defined decision-basis (answer-key), and/or b) facilitate sufficient learning, both of which require ample data (observability) and ample time for the machine to develop a logical outcome. Much research has been focused on developing decision algorithms using various logical formulations, dimensionality reductions, neural techniques, and learning reinforcements for tasks that traditionally require human intelligence. What is missing in most current research streams are implementations of ML and AI for decisions that are fundamentally rooted in human intuition and empathy, e.g., situations in which the decision requires a holistic view and the outcome is based on a qualitative judgement based on context and fact. This paper is intended to benefit a wide range of readers considering Artificial Intelligence, from the merely curious to 'techies' from other disciplines to experienced practitioners and researchers. Using a qualitative/ characteristics base perspective of data and AI, we examine defense industry procurement, operational, tactical, and strategic decision scenarios, then identify where AI can currently promote better informed decisions and which arenas need would benefit by letting AI technology and sophistication evolve further. © 2020 IEEE.","2020","2021-04-20 16:38:32","2021-04-20 16:38:32","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Computer Society","","English","","","","","","","ISSN: 1095323X","<p>cited By 0; Conference of 2020 IEEE Aerospace Conference, AERO 2020 ; Conference Date: 7 March 2020 Through 14 March 2020; Conference Code:162583</p>","","","Cross-disciplinary; Decision algorithms; Decision making; Dimensionality reduction; Human intelligence; Informed decision; Learning reinforcements; Learning systems; Qualitative characteristics; Real time decision-making; Reinforcement learning; Strategic decisions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In doing so it provides a response to the Richardson et al. article in <italic>IEEE Technology and Society Magazine</italic>, Mar. 2018 [20]. This article concludes that deployment of robots to control the behavior of autistic children is ethically suspect and should be questioned. The use of robots with children should be evaluated on the basis of the purpose of and process by which such robots are deployed, rather than on the basis of the technology itself. Particularly important is the roboticist's empathy with the user of the robot, and gaining an understanding of the individual child.

The goal of this mixed-methods study was to understand teens' operation of, and responsiveness to, a robot only capable of movement compared to a robot only capable of speech. Stemming from a human-centered approach, we introduce a Participatory Wizard of Oz (PWoz) interaction method that engaged teens as operators, users, and witnesses in a uniquely transparent interaction.

Using this technique, we present results from a study with 62 teens that includes details of the complexity of teen stress and a significant reduction in negative attitudes toward robots after interactions. We analyzed the teens' interactions with both the verbal and non-verbal robots and identified strong themes of (1) authenticity, (2) empathy, (3) emotional engagement, and (4) imperfection creates connection.

An untested implication of this hypothesis is that these stable patterns of connectivity should be visible even in the absence of empathy tasks. Using machine learning, we demonstrate that patterns of resting state fMRI connectivity (i.e. the degree of synchronous BOLD activity across multiple cortical areas in the absence of explicit task demands) of resonance and control networks predict trait empathic concern (n = 58). Empathic concern was also predicted by connectivity patterns within the somatomotor network. These findings further support the role of resonance-control network interactions and of somatomotor function in our vicariously driven concern for others.

This assessment, run entirely on a tablet, measures decision-making via a suite of neurocognitive tests in less than 30 minutes. The software measures several cognitive and decision-making traits of the user, including impulsivity, empathy, aggression, and several other traits linked to reoffending. Our analysis measured whether this assessment successfully predicted recidivism by testing probationers in a large urban city (Houston, TX, United States) from 2017 to 2019. To determine predictive validity, we used machine learning to yield cross-validated receiver–operator characteristics. Results gave a recidivism prediction value of 0.70, making it comparable to commonly used risk assessments. This novel approach diverges from traditional self-reporting, interview-based, and criminal-records-based approaches, and can also add a protective layer against bias, while strengthening model accuracy in predicting reoffense. In addition, subjectivity is eliminated and time-consuming administrative efforts are reduced. With continued data collection, this approach opens the possibility of identifying different levels of recidivism risk, by crime type, for any age, or gender, and seeks to steer individuals appropriately toward rehabilitative programs.

Socially-assistive robots (SAR) have been used to reduce pain and distress in children in medical settings. Patients who perceive empathic treatment have increased satisfaction and improved outcomes. We sought to determine if an empathic SAR could be developed and used to decrease pain and fear associated with peripheral IV placement in children. Methods. We conducted a pilot study of children receiving IV placement. Participating children were randomized to interact with (1) no robot, or a commercially available 3D printed humanoid SAR robot programmed with (2) empathy or (3) distraction conditions. Children and parents completed demographic surveys, and children used an adapted validated questionnaire to rate the robot's empathy on an 8-point Likert scale. Survey scores were compared by the t-test or chi-square test. Pain and fear were measured by self-report using the FACES and FEAR scales, and video tapes were coded using the CHEOPS and FLACC. Scores were compared using repeated measures 2-way ANOVA. This trial is registered with NCT02840942. Results. Thirty-one children with an average age of 9.6 years completed the study. For all measures, mean pain and fear scores were lowest in the empathy group immediately before and after IV placement. Children were more likely to attribute characteristics of empathy to the empathic condition (Likert score 7.24 v. 4.70; p=0.012) and to report that having the empathic vs. distraction robot made the IV hurt less (7.45 vs. 4.88; p=0.026). Conclusions. Children were able to identify SAR designed to display empathic characteristics and reported it helped with IV insertion pain and fear. Mean scores of self-reported or objective pain and fear scales were the lowest in the empathy group and the highest in the distraction condition before and after IV insertion. This result suggests empathy improves SAR functionality when used for painful medical procedures and informs future research into SAR for pain management. © 2020 Margaret J Trost et al.","2020","2021-04-20 16:38:33","2021-04-20 16:38:33","","","","","2020","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: Hindawi Limited","<p>cited By 3</p>","","","Administration; adverse event; analgesia; Article; child; Child; clinical article; controlled study; devices; distractibility; distress syndrome; empathy; Empathy; fear; female; Female; health care survey; human; Humans; Intravenous; intravenous drug administration; Likert scale; male; Male; pain; Pain; Pain Management; parent; patient satisfaction; Pilot Projects; pilot study; Preschool; preschool child; procedures; psychology; questionnaire; randomized controlled trial; robotics; Robotics; satisfaction; school child; self report; socially assistive robot; Surveys and Questionnaires; three dimensional printing; vein catheterization; vein puncture; videorecording","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Additionally, to learn and apply the correct behaviors, robots must be able to perceive and understand the affective states of humans. This study presents a framework to enable cognitive empathy in social robots, which uses facial emotion recognition to perceive and understand the affective states of human users. The perceived affective state is then provided to a reinforcement learning model to enable a robot to learn the most appropriate empathic behaviors for different states. The proposed framework has been evaluated through an experiment between 28 individual humans and the humanoid robot Pepper.

While human-human mimicry has been extensively studied, human-agent and human-robot mimicry have been addressed only recently, and the individual characteristics that affect them are still unknown. This paper explores whether the humanlikeness and embodiment of an agent affect human facial mimicry and which personality and empathy traits are related to facial mimicry of human and artificial agents. We exposed 46 participants to the six basic emotions displayed by a video-recorded human and three artificial agents (a physical robot, a video-recorded robot, and a virtual agent) differing in humanlikeness (humanlike, characterlike, and a morph between the two). We asked participants to recognize the facial expressions performed by each agent and measured their facial mimicry using automatic detection of facial action unit activation. Results showed that mimicry was affected by the agents’ embodiment, but not by their humanlikeness, and that it correlated both with individual traits denoting sociability and sympathy and with traits advantageous for emotion recognition. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","2020","2021-04-20 16:38:33","2021-04-20 16:38:33","","120-131","","","12483 LNAI","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","ISBN: 9783030620554 Publisher: Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","<p>cited By 0; Conference of 12th International Conference on Social Robotics, ICSR 2020 ; Conference Date: 14 November 2020 Through 18 November 2020; Conference Code:251579</p>","","","Artificial agents; Automatic Detection; Emotion recognition; Face recognition; Facial Expressions; Human likeness; Individual characteristics; Physical robots; Robotics; Robots; Social interactions","","Wagner A.R., Sam Ge S., Feil-Seifer D., Haring K.S., Rossi S., Williams T., He H.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Objective: This study aimed to explore psychiatrists’ opinions about the potential impact innovations in artificial intelligence and machine learning on psychiatric practice Methods: In Spring 2019, we conducted a web-based survey of 791 psychiatrists from 22 countries worldwide. The survey measured opinions about the likelihood future technology would fully replace physicians in performing ten key psychiatric tasks. This study involved qualitative descriptive analysis of written responses (“comments”) to three open-ended questions in the survey. Results: Comments were classified into four major categories in relation to the impact of future technology on: (1) patient-psychiatrist interactions; (2) the quality of patient medical care; (3) the profession of psychiatry; and (4) health systems. Overwhelmingly, psychiatrists were skeptical that technology could replace human empathy. Many predicted that ‘man and machine’ would increasingly collaborate in undertaking clinical decisions, with mixed opinions about the benefits and harms of such an arrangement. Participants were optimistic that technology might improve efficiencies and access to care, and reduce costs. Ethical and regulatory considerations received limited attention. Conclusions: This study presents timely information on psychiatrists’ views about the scope of artificial intelligence and machine learning on psychiatric practice. Psychiatrists expressed divergent views about the value and impact of future technology with worrying omissions about practice guidelines, and ethical and regulatory issues. © The Author(s) 2020.","2020","2021-04-20 16:38:33","2021-04-20 16:38:33","","","","","6","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: SAGE Publications Inc.","<p>cited By 1</p>","","","adult; article; artificial intelligence; attention; attitude; empathy; human; machine learning; male; medical care; mental health; occupation; practice guideline; psychiatrist; psychiatry; qualitative research; spring","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

When this dyad is completed, mind attribution towards intentionally harmed liminal minds is enhanced. However, from a dehumanisation view, malevolent actions may instead result in a denial of humanness. To contrast both accounts, a visual vignette experiment (N = 253) depicted either malevolent or benevolent intentions towards robotic or human avatars. Additionally, we examined the role of harm-salience by showing patients as either harmed, or still unharmed. The results revealed significantly increased mind attribution towards visibly harmed patients, mediated by perceived pain and expressed empathy. Benevolent and malevolent intentions were evaluated respectively as morally right or wrong, but their impact on the patient was diminished for the robotic avatar. Contrary to dehumanisation predictions, our manipulation of intentions failed to affect mind perception. Nonetheless, benevolent intentions reduced dehumanisation of the patients. Moreover, when pain and empathy were statistically controlled, the effect of intentions on mind perception was mediated by dehumanisation. These findings suggest that perceived intentions might only be indirectly tied to mind perception, and that their role may be better understood when additionally accounting for empathy and dehumanisation. © 2020 The Authors.

The robot’s voice can be used to express empathy, which is an affective response of the robot to the human user. In this study, the aim is to find out if social robots with empathetic voice are acceptable for users in healthcare applications. A pilot study using an empathetic voice spoken by a voice actor was conducted. Only prosody in speech is used to express empathy here, without any visual cues. Also, the emotions needed for an empathetic voice are identified. It was found that the emotions needed are not only the stronger primary emotions, but also the nuanced secondary emotions. These emotions are then synthesised using prosody modelling. A second study, replicating the pilot test is conducted using the synthesised voices to investigate if empathy is perceived from the synthetic voice as well. This paper reports the modelling and synthesises of an empathetic voice, and experimentally shows that people prefer empathetic voice for healthcare robots. The results can be further used to develop empathetic social robots, that can improve people’s acceptance of social robots. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","2020","2021-04-20 16:38:34","2021-04-20 16:38:34","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: Springer","<p>cited By 0</p>","","","Affective response; Agricultural robots; Health care; Health care application; Human users; Major factors; Pilot studies; Pilot tests; Prosody modelling; Social robots; Speech synthesis; Synthetic voices","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper automatically creates empathy word ratings from document-level ratings. The underlying problem of learning word ratings from higher-level supervision has to date only been addressed in an ad hoc fashion and has not used deep learning methods. We systematically compare a number of approaches to learning word ratings from higher-level supervision against a Mixed-Level Feed Forward Network (MLFFN), which we find performs best, and use the MLFFN to create the first-ever empathy lexicon.

Prosocial games are games focusing on helping others. Game researchers have been keen to investigate factors that influence the immersive experience in digital games. Previous studies show that VR allows people to take the perspective of others, inducing empathy and prosocial behaviour in the real world. In this lab-based study, we explore whether and how taking the perspective of other game characters–NPCs in a prosocial VR game–influences players’ in-game empathy towards NPCs and game immersion. Participants first experienced either a robot’s perspective of being destroyed by fire in VR or read a text description about the same event. Then, they participated a prosocial VR game in which they saved robots. The findings show that perspective-taking experiences indirectly enhance participants’ game immersion via the effects of closeness with the destroyed robot and empathy towards the four robots protected by the player.

However, studies investigating social cognition, such as empathy and its underlying neural basis, are lacking. To explore the neural interactions among reward and memory circuits, we applied effective connectivity analysis on resting-state fMRI data collected from cocaine-dependent subjects. The relationship between effective connectivity within these two important circuits and empathy ability - evaluated with the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) - was assessed by machine learning algorithm using multivariate regression analysis. In accordance with the neurocircuitry disruptions of cocaine addiction, the results showed that cocaine-dependent subjects relative to healthy controls had altered resting state effective connectivity between parts of the memory and reward systems. Furthermore, effective connectivity between the memory and reward system could predict the fantasy empathy (FE) subscale scores in cocaine dependence. Overall, our findings provide further evidence for the neural substrates of social cognition in cocaine-dependent patients. These new insights could be useful for the development of new treatment programs for this substance dependency disorder. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","2020","2021-04-20 16:38:34","2021-04-20 16:38:34","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: Springer","<p>cited By 0</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In order for such an agent to be recognized as a listener of narratives and convey the attitude of attentive listening, it is necessary to generate responsive utterances. Moreover, responsive utterances can express empathy to narratives and showing an appropriate degree of empathy to narratives is significant for enhancing speaker's motivation. The degree of empathy shown by responsive utterances is thought to depend on their type. However, the relation between responsive utterances and degrees of the empathy has not been explored yet. This paper describes the classification of responsive utterances based on the degree of empathy in order to explain that relation. In this research, responsive utterances are classified into five levels based on the effect of utterances and literature on attentive listening.

In the process of understanding the factors that influence bullying behaviours, researchers turned towards investigating moral factors, such as moral emotions, especially disgust and anger, and particularly a process called” moral disengagement” (MD; [22]). Moral disengagement is thought to contribute to the reason why some individuals, although they express disgust and anger in response to bullying behaviors, do not intervene in such situations. The objective of this research is to propose a VR based intervention aimed at increasing prosocial behaviour by improving perspective taking-skills and empathy concern. In the current paper, we suggest an interactive training simulation program where adolescent volunteers will take their own perspective or the perspective of the avatar in virtual reality, being instructed to try and understand its mental states. The situations encountered in VR are meant to trigger feelings of disgust, anger or elevation, the latter being an emotion elicited by witnessing acts of moral goodness. By increasing the propensity to take the perspective of the avatar, we aim to decrease the process of moral disengagement, especially in bullying and cyberbullying situations and increase prosocial behavior in adolescents. © 2020, National Defence University - Carol I Printing House.

The human vulnerabilities experienced in the healthcare context raise the stakes of new technologies such as AI, and the human dimensions of AI in healthcare have particular significance for research in the humanities. This article explains four key areas of concern relating to AI and the role that medical/health humanities research can play in addressing them: definition and regulation of “medical” versus “health” data and apps; social determinants of health; narrative medicine; and technological mediation of care. Issues include data privacy and trust, flawed datasets and algorithmic bias, racial discrimination, and the rhetoric of humanism and disability.

This article analyzes the impact of strategic stability of the use of AI in the strategic decision-making process, in particular, the risks and trade-offs of pre-delegating military force (or automating escalation) to machines. It argues that AI-enabled decision support tools, by substituting the role of human critical thinking, empathy, creativity, and intuition in the strategic decision-making process, will be fundamentally destabilizing if defense planners come to view AI’s ‘support’ function as a panacea for the cognitive fallibilities and human analysis and decision-making.

The interaction via natural language in combination with a human-like design promises service that is always available, fast, and with a consistent quality and at the same time resembles a human service encounter. However, current conversational agents exhibit the same inherent limitation that every interactive technology has, which is a lack of social skills. In this study, we make a first step towards overcoming this limitation by presenting a design approach that combines automatic sentiment analysis with adaptive responses to emulate empathy in a service encounter. By means of an experiment with 112 participants, we evaluate the approach and find empirical support that a CA with sentiment-adaptive responses is perceived as more empathetic, human-like, and socially present and, in particular, yields a higher service encounter satisfaction. © 40th International Conference on Information Systems, ICIS 2019.

Robots offer the potential to provide healthcare support to patients both at home and in healthcare settings. However, in order for robots to be successfully implemented in these environments, they need to behave in ways that are appropriate and acceptable to human users. One way to identify appropriate social behaviours for healthcare robots is to model their behaviour on interactions between healthcare professionals and patients. This literature review aimed to inform healthcare robotics research by highlighting communication behaviours that are important within the context of healthcare. The review focussed on relevant research in human clinical interactions, followed by a review of similar factors in social robotics research. Three databases were searched for terms relating to healthcare professional communication behaviours associated with patient outcomes. The results identified key communication behaviours that can convey clinical empathy, including humour, self-disclosure, facial expressions, eye gaze, body posture, and gestures. A further search was conducted to identify research examining these key behaviours within the context of social and healthcare robotics.

Part I briefly describes some of the ways AI is already in use in ordinary life-from facial recognition, through medical diagnosis to translation services. Part II describes how AI is transforming what it means to provide legal services in six primary areas: Litigation review; expertise automation; legal research; contract analytics; contract and litigation document generation; and predictive analytics. Part III explores who are the providers of these AI driven legal services-often non-lawyer legal service providers-and how these providers are replacing at least some of what clients have traditionally sought from lawyers. Part III also discusses the implications of all these changes both for the future role of lawyers individually, and in particular what services will clients still need lawyers to perform: Judgment, empathy, creativity and adaptability. In turn, this Part examines what will these changes mean for the size, shape, composition and economic model of law firms, as well as the implications of these changes for legal education and lawyer training. Part IV identifies the principal legal, ethical, regulatory and risk management issues raised by the use of AI in the provision of legal services. Finally, in Part V the article considers who will be the likely providers of AI based services other than law firms: Legal publishers, major accounting firms and venture capital funded businesses. © 2020 Fundacao Getulio Vargas, Escola de Direito de Sao Paulo.

Focusing on the implication of a loss of empathy, it structures CASR's worries as an argument from moral degradation centered around the potential effects on sexbot users' sexual and moral subjectivity. This argument is subsequently explored through the combined lenses of postphenomenology and the ethical phenomenology of Emmanuel Levinas. In so doing, it describes the type of human-technology relations that sexbots invite, identifying alterity as a central feature. It also highlights how alterity, responsibility, and subjectivity are intimately connected. However, that connection is distinctly different in sexual circumstances, making current versions of Levinasian roboethics largely inapplicable for the ethics of sexbots. To overcome this, the article delves into Levinas' phenomenology of Eros and identifies voluptuousness as a type of enjoyment of the Other that is different from the enjoyment invited by current sexbots and is compatible with responsibility. Based on this, the article provides examples of how this phenomenology of Eros can inspire the design of future sexbots in ways that alleviate some of CASR's concerns. © 2020 Jan Peter Bergen, published by De Gruyter 2020.","2020","2021-04-20 16:38:36","2021-04-20 16:38:36","","284-300","","1","11","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: De Gruyter","<p>cited By 1</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Also, virtual reality can promote patient/teacher interaction: both, for example, can be projected or immersed in virtual reality, or the teacher can project his ‘virtual’ image into a real scenario. However, robots too could contribute to training nursing staff: health operator training courses today widely use dummies which are appropriately planned for standing training.

It seemed to have appropriated some of the key issues of the genre discourse–the question of what constitutes humanity, of the possibility of coexistence between humans and AI, of the problems of morality and consent. It also made use of time-honored devices of alternative history without treating it too seriously. Instead, the characters are enmeshed in personal problems and conundrums of science and politics, justice and empathy–and love. McEwan’s commentary on the novel in various interviews only aggravated the critics who were all too ready to conclude that Machines Like Me offered little originality. This essay will demonstrate that the text is carefully layered as if to protect its own novelty hidden beneath rather conventional love triangle plot, ponderous political commentary, and genre-specific topicality. It will be an effort to understand the complex relation between the writer and conventions which come into play in his novel, and it will proceed to read the text against the authorial comments, finding suppressed hints that invite an interpretation of the text as narrated by its android hero rather than human subject. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","2020","2021-04-20 16:38:36","2021-04-20 16:38:36","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: Routledge","<p>cited By 0</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

NESTORE e-coach is known as a personalized embodied and ubiquitous e-coach that plays three essential roles in elderly’s wellbeing: a coach, a friend and a companion. As a coach, NESTORE will give trainings and advice following a wellbeing path that is proposed by experts in wellbeing. As a friend, this e-coach knows and understands the user. As a companion, this e-coach has the ability to detect the user’s emotion and aims at building empathy with the user based by providing support throughout their daily training. The NESTORE e-coach is based on three different intervention medium: a mobile application, a chatbot and an embodied vocal assistant. These interfaces have different forms, different capabilities and different visions. Users can communicate with the NESTORE e-coach through different interfaces exclusively, sequentially, concurrently and synergistically. The interaction can be initiated from the user side to different interfaces and/or from the e-coach side. In this paper, we present the NESTORE’s full vision for building the three essential roles of this e-coach which are: a coach, a companion and a friend for seniors. Furthermore, we explain the NESTORE system design, architecture, capabilities and how the different interfaces of this E-coach contribute to make a multi-modal system.

The research is designed in qualitative research methods, phenomenology patterns using interview techniques. The study group consists of 17 special education teachers. The data were analyzed by content analysis. In the study, it was concluded that there are problems arising from legal and administrative deficiencies within the Ministry of National Education. It has been revealed that the problems encountered in inclusion practices are not simple enough to be overcome only by legal regulations, but that these problems are a system problem. Deficiencies in managerial processes affect all processes of inclusion practices. This situation hinders the academic and social development of the inclusion student and it is concluded that it plays a slowing role in achieving the desired integration objectives. Another important result of the study is that the social and cultural context is effective as the source of the problems related to inclusion practices. It was concluded that this situation leads to deep turmoil in the emotion world of inclusion students. In this context, it has been revealed that the empathy, knowledge and awareness levels of all stakeholders related to inclusion should be improved. In addition, it was emphasized that the inclusion process contributes positively to the attitudes, behaviors and learning of students who show normal development. Another result is revealed that all stakeholders, from top level decision makers, to education administrators, from teachers to students and parents, should take responsibility concerning inclusion policies in a coordinated and planned manner, in order to achieve the standard and quality in the education systems of developed countries. In addition, instead of focusing on academic achievement to overcome the difficulties experienced and support stakeholders, it was emphasized that take into account individual differences and necessity of the use of technology, artificial intelligence and robotic applications in learning processes. The research is important for educational and managerial analysis of inclusion practices in school organizations. © 2020, Milli Egitim.

Fair Play is an avatar-based role-playing video game in which Jamal Davis, a Black graduate student at a research university, navigates implicit forms of racial bias to reach the win-state of earning his PhD and becoming a professor. Fair Play was designed to educate players on the existence of racial bias in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine (STEMM) fields in an experiential way and to encourage perspective-taking. Research has found that taking the perspective of another can induce empathy, which improves the empathizer’s attitudes towards individuals and groups. Paired with a facilitated workshop, Fair Play was also designed to teach bias concepts to increase participants’ bias literacy. Intervention. Research on workshops to reduce gender bias suggests that it increased awareness of personal bias, the motivation and self-efficacy to practice bias-reducing strategies, and a more welcoming department climate and the hiring of more women faculty three years after the intervention. Capitalizing on these findings, a 3-hour workshop was developed to reduce race-based bias against Black/African Americans in STEMM using Fair Play. Conclusions. The facilitation of the workshops and Fair Play requires particular competencies due to its topic (racial bias) and player’s skepticism about the reality of the bias incidents. Our data suggest that participants who identify as a person of color are more likely to believe that bias exists compared to White players, which can lead to a discussion about how the incidents in the game were designed and scripted. The facilitator also needs to be versed in a number of intentional design choices, such as Jamal not having voiceover and his success. Finally, this paper describes the Facilitator Game, which was developed as a complement to the game and allows a facilitator to jump to bias incidents quickly while debriefing and discussing the game to further participant learning. © 2020 SAGE Publications.","2020","2021-04-20 16:38:36","2021-04-20 16:38:36","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: SAGE Publications Inc.","<p>cited By 0</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, cognitive skills are not sufficient for a successful life. Understanding and managing the emotions of oneself is another crucial factor in success. The current state of the art teaching methods educates the kids about programming and emotional intelligence independently. In our opinion, it is advantageous to teach kids emotional intelligence, along with the programming concepts. However, the literature lacks the studies that make students emotionally aware while teaching them programming. This research aims to prepare students to be cognitively healthy as well as emotionally intelligent with the hypothesis that a kid's emotional intelligence can be enhanced while teaching them cognitive skills. We proposed a computational model that teaches programming and emotional intelligence side by side to students. The model provides a curriculum and related tools. For evaluations, five hundred students of a public school were involved in different activities to find the effectiveness of the proposed model. These students were divided into five groups (A, B, C, D, and E), each having a mean age of 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 years, respectively. Students performed multiple adaptive scenarios of path-finding that were based on self-awareness, social-awareness, sharing, and empathy emotions. Students provide the programming instructions such as sequencing, conditional statements, and looping to a robot. The children have successfully improved in both fundamental programming constructs and emotional intelligence skills. The research also successfully reduced screen time problem by providing a screen-free student interface. © 2013 IEEE.","2020","2021-04-20 16:38:36","2021-04-20 16:38:36","","149616-149629","","","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","<p>cited By 0</p>","","","Computation model; Computation theory; Computational model; Computational thinkings; Education computing; Emotional intelligence; Learning programming; Programming concepts; Programming instruction; Robot programming; Social awareness; State of the art; Students","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We draw on a particular line of posthumanist theory associated closely with the work of Karen Barad, Rosi Braidotti and N. Katherine Hayles that suggests a constantly permeable, fluid and extended subjectivity, displacing the boundaries between human and other. In doing so, we propose a posthuman concept of empathy in gameplay, and we apply this concept to data from the first author’s 18-month ethnographic field notes of gameplay in the MMORPG World of Warcraft. Exploring these data through our analysis of posthuman empathy, we demonstrate the entanglement of avatar–player, machine–human relationship. We show how empathy allows us to understand this relationship as constantly negotiated and in process, producing visceral reactions in the intra-connected avatar–player subject as well as moments of co-produced in-game action that require ‘affective matching’ between subjective and embodied experiences. We argue that this account of the avatar–player relationship extends research in game culture, providing a horizontal, non-hierarchical discussion of its most necessary interaction. © The Author(s) 2017.","2019","2021-04-20 16:38:36","2021-04-20 16:38:36","","791-806","","5-6","25","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: SAGE Publications Ltd","<p>cited By 2</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To fill the research gaps, we use time-aware social networks to combine various information sources in social media posts. Also, machine learning detectors are trained to automatically identify empathic interactions, filter out irrelevant information and construct empathy-based networks.

One such problem of particular importance is the low accuracy of predictions. This paper suggests that users' help is a practical approach to improve accuracy and it considers four factors that trigger users' willingness to help for an imperfect AI system. The two factors covered in Study 1 are utilitarian benefit based on egoistic motivation, and empathy based on altruistic motivation. In Study 2, utilitarian benefit is divided into explainable AI and monetary reward. The results indicate that two variables, namely empathy and monetary reward, have significant positive effects on willingness to help, and monetary reward is the strongest stimulus. In addition, explainable AI is shown to be positively associated with trust in AI. This study applies social studies of help motivation to the HCI field in order to induce users' willingness to help for an imperfect AI. The triggers of help motivation, empathy and monetary reward, can be utilized to induce the users’ voluntary engagement in the loop with an imperfect AI. © 2019","2019","2021-04-20 16:38:37","2021-04-20 16:38:37","","180-196","","","101","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>cited By 4</p>","","","AI systems; article; artificial intelligence; Artificial intelligence; empathy; Food image; human; human experiment; Human-in-the-loop; Image recognition; Monetary rewards; motivation; Motivation; reward; Social study; sociology; stimulus; trust; Trust; Willingness to help","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, it is not known whether real-world altruists’ heightened empathy reflects true self-other mapping of multi-voxel neural response patterns. We investigated this relationship in adults who had engaged in extraordinarily costly real-world altruism: donating a kidney to a stranger. Altruists and controls completed fMRI testing while anticipating and experiencing pain, and watching as a stranger anticipated and experienced pain. Machine learning classifiers tested for shared representation between experienced and observed distress. Altruists exhibited more similar representations of experienced and observed fearful anticipation spontaneously and following an empathy prompt in anterior insula and anterior/middle cingulate cortex, respectively, suggesting heightened empathic proclivities and abilities for fear. During pain epochs, altruists were distinguished by spontaneous empathic responses in anterior insula, anterior/mid-cingulate cortex and supplementary motor area, but showed no difference from controls after the empathy prompt. These findings (1) link shared multi-voxel representations of the distress of self and others to real-world costly altruism, (2) reinforce distinctions between empathy for sensory states like pain and anticipatory affective states like fear, and (3) highlight the importance of differentiating between the proclivity and ability to empathize. © 2019, The Author(s).","2019","2021-04-20 16:38:37","2021-04-20 16:38:37","","","","1","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","<p>cited By 3</p>","","","adult; Adult; altruism; Altruism; brain; Brain; diagnostic imaging; distress syndrome; donor; empathy; Empathy; female; Female; functional neuroimaging; Functional Neuroimaging; human; Humans; kidney; Kidney; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; male; Male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; physiology; Psychological Distress; psychology; Tissue Donors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study examines perceived mistreatment directed towards a robot in comparison to a computer. This will provide some understanding of how people feel about robots in collaborative social settings. We conducted a two by two between-subjects study with 80 participants. Participants worked cooperatively with either a robot or a computer agent. An experiment confederate would either act aggressively or neutrally towards the agent. We hypothesized that people would not perceive aggressive speech as mistreatment when an agent was capable of emotional feelings and similar to themselves; that participants would perceive the robot as more similar in appearance and emotionally capable to themselves than a computer; and so would observe more mistreatment with a robot. The final results supported our hypotheses; the participants observed greater mistreatment for the robot, but not the computer. Also participants felt significantly more sympathetic towards the robot and believed that it was much more emotionally capable. © 2019, The Author(s).","2019","2021-04-20 16:38:37","2021-04-20 16:38:37","","727-739","","5","11","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: Springer Science and Business Media B.V.","<p>cited By 4</p>","","","Agricultural robots; Behavioral research; Computer agents; Emotional feeling; Mistreatment; Robot cooperation; Robot interactions; Sensory perception; Social robots; Social settings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we use a simple neuroscience-inspired procedure to beam our human subjects into one of two distinct robots and demonstrate how this can readily increase acceptability and social closeness to that robot. Participants wore a Head Mounted Display tracking their head movements and displaying the 3D visual scene taken from the eyes of a robot which was positioned in front of a mirror and piloted by the subjects’ head movements. As a result, participants saw themselves as a robot. When participant’ and robot’s head movements were correlated, participants felt that they were incorporated into the robot with a sense of agency. Critically, the robot they embodied was judged more likeable and socially closer. Remarkably, we found that the beaming experience with correlated head movements and corresponding sensation of embodiment and social proximity, was independent of robots’ humanoid’s appearance. These findings not only reveal the ease of body-swapping, via visual-motor synchrony, into robots that do not share any clear human resemblance, but they may also pave a new way to make our future robotic helpers socially acceptable. © 2019, The Author(s).","2019","2021-04-20 16:38:37","2021-04-20 16:38:37","","","","1","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","<p>cited By 5</p>","","","adult; article; attitude; Attitude; awareness; Awareness; emotion; Emotions; eye; female; Female; head movement; Head Movements; human; human experiment; human relation; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; intimacy; male; Male; neuroscience; physiology; procedures; robotics; Robotics; sensation; social competence; Social Skills; young adult; Young Adult","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, only few studies have investigated how functional network changes are related to social anhedonia. The aim of this fMRI study was to classify subjects according to their degree of social anhedonia using supervised machine learning. More specifically, we extracted both spatial and temporal network features during a social cognition task from 70 subjects, and used support vector machines for classification. Since impairment in social cognition is well established in schizophrenia-spectrum disorders, the subjects performed a comic strip task designed to specifically probe theory of mind (ToM) and empathy processing. Features representing both temporal (time series) and network dynamics were extracted using task activation maps, seed region analysis, independent component analysis (ICA), and a newly developed multi-subject archetypal analysis (MSAA), which here aimed to further bridge aspects of both seed region analysis and decomposition by incorporating a spotlight approach.We found significant classification of subjects with elevated levels of social anhedonia when using the times series extracted using MSAA, indicating that temporal dynamics carry important information for classification of social anhedonia. Interestingly, we found that the same time series yielded the highest classification performance in a task classification of the ToM condition. Finally, the spatial network corresponding to that time series included both prefrontal and temporal-parietal regions as well as insula activity, which previously have been related schizotypy and the development of schizophrenia. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","2019","2021-04-20 16:38:37","2021-04-20 16:38:37","","4965-4981","","17","40","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: John Wiley and Sons Inc.","<p>cited By 2</p>","","","adolescent; Adolescent; adult; anhedonia; Anhedonia; Article; brain; Brain; classification; college student; Computer-Assisted; diagnostic imaging; empathy; Empathy; female; Female; functional connectivity; functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; Humans; image analysis; image processing; Image Processing; independent component analysis; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; major clinical study; male; Male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; perception; physiology; priority journal; schizophrenia; Schizophrenia; schizophrenia spectrum disorder; social behavior; Social Behavior; social cognition; Social Perception; supervised machine learning; support vector machine; Support Vector Machine; theory of mind; Theory of Mind; young adult; Young Adult","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the present study, we investigated the relationship between mimicry and cognitive and emotional empathy. To assess mimicry, facial electromyography was recorded for 70 participants while they completed the Multifaceted Empathy Test, which presents complex context-embedded emotional expressions. As predicted, inter-individual differences in emotional and cognitive empathy were associated with the level of facial mimicry. For positive emotions, the intensity of the mimicry response scaled with the level of state emotional empathy. Mimicry was stronger for the emotional empathy task compared to the cognitive empathy task. The specific empathy condition could be successfully detected from facial muscle activity at the level of single individuals using machine learning techniques. These results support the view that mimicry occurs depending on the social context as a tool to affiliate and it is involved in cognitive as well as emotional empathy. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

In this study, we investigated the influence of the visualization of a real-time personalized avatar on gait parameters, focusing on knee flexion during the swing phase. We also studied the impact of the modification of avatar's knee amplitude on kinematic of the knee of healthy subjects. For this purpose, we used an immersive reality treadmill equipment and developed a 3D avatar, with instantly modifiable parameters for knee flexion and extension (acceleration or deceleration). Fourteen healthy young adults, equipped with motion capture markers, were asked to walk at a self-selected pace on the treadmill. A real-time 3D image of their lower limbs was modelized and projected on the screen ahead of them, as if in a walking motion from left to right. The subjects were instructed to continue walking. When we initiated an increase in the knee flexion of the avatar, we observed a similar increase in the subjects' knee flexion. No significant results were observed when the modification involved a decrease in knee flexion. The results and their significance are discussed using theories encompassing empathy, sympathy and sensory re-calibration. The prospect of using this type of modified avatar for stroke rehabilitation is discussed. © 2019 The Author(s)","2019","2021-04-20 16:38:37","2021-04-20 16:38:37","","","","11","5","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>cited By 0</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Life experience and imagination are as essential to narrative as narrative is to mankind. The phylogenic perspective of literature suggests an inborn capacity for empathy, intelligence and inventiveness, whereas the ontological example is variable. Western knowledge, politics and ethics have evolved from their narrative of Greek myth, epic and drama, the few medieval writers, singularly by the Elizabethan theater, importantly the Arthurian legend and romance stories, English and Russian novels, and uniquely the American short story. This heritage progressively demarcated such life themes as the hero, maiden and adversary; love, hate and indifference; loyalty, deception and betrayal; desire, achievement and loss. These characterizations of self and other remain relevant to the contemporary novel, cinema/TV, and theater, as well as the news, commentary, and real life. Conversely, postmodern assumptions challenge that individual subjectivity determines what is real, valid or authentic, consequently the relativism of traditional, institutional and historical precedents of the truth. Further, the computer, gaming, smart device, and artificial intelligence have changed the content and function of customary narrative. Nonetheless, narrative — real and imagined, ancient and new — retains the meaning of a story about connected events which variously transcends the boundaries of difference. ©, Copyright © Melvin Bornstein, Joseph Lichtenberg, Donald Silver.","2019","2021-04-20 16:38:38","2021-04-20 16:38:38","","476-484","","7","39","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: Routledge","<p>cited By 1</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although there are many methods for measuring emotion from both facial expression and biological signals, few studies have been done on the comparison of estimated emotion. In this paper, we investigate whether emotion estimated from facial expression or biological signals could lead to empathy toward a robot.

In this paper I argue that many medical decisions require value judgements and the doctor-patient relationship requires empathy and understanding to arrive at a shared decision, often handling large areas of uncertainty and balancing competing risks. Arguably, medicine requires wisdom more than intelligence, artificial or otherwise.

Participants completed paper-based postinteraction measures relating to engagement, perceived robot attention, and perceived robot empathy. We video recorded interactions and coded for participant attentional behaviors. Results: A total of 181 participants were recruited from the University of Auckland. Participants who interacted with the robot in the forward lean and self-disclosure conditions found the robot to be significantly more stimulating than those who interacted with the robot in the voice pitch or neutral conditions (P=.03). Participants in the forward lean, self-disclosure, and neutral conditions found the robot to be significantly more interesting than those in the voice pitch condition (P<.001). Participants in the forward lean and self-disclosure conditions spent significantly more time looking at the robot than participants in the neutral condition (P<.001). Significantly, more participants in the self-disclosure condition laughed during the interaction (P=.01), whereas significantly more participants in the forward lean condition leant toward the robot during the interaction (P<.001). Conclusions: The use of self-disclosure and forward lean by a health care robot can increase human engagement and attentional behaviors. Voice pitch changes did not increase attention or engagement. The small effects with regard to participant perceptions are potentially because of the limitations in self-report measures or a lack of comparison for most participants who had never interacted with a robot before. Further research could explore the use of self-disclosure and forward lean using a within-subjects design and in real health care settings. © Deborah L Johanson, Ho Seok Ahn, Bruce A MacDonald, Byeong Kyu Ahn, JongYoon Lim, Euijun Hwang, Craig J Sutherland, Elizabeth Broadbent.","2019","2021-04-20 16:38:38","2021-04-20 16:38:38","","","","10","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: JMIR Publications Inc.","<p>cited By 4</p>","","","80 and over; adolescent; Adolescent; adult; Adult; aged; Aged; article; attention; Attention; controlled study; emotional intelligence; Emotional Intelligence; empathy; female; Female; human; human experiment; human relation; Humans; intelligence; Interpersonal Relations; major clinical study; male; Male; medical receptionist; middle aged; Middle Aged; perception; physiology; pitch; procedures; randomized controlled trial; robotics; Robotics; self disclosure; self report; simulation; social interaction; very elderly; videorecording; voice; young adult; Young Adult","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

University students responded to questionnaires regarding three animism tendencies (i.e., general animism or a tendency to believe souls or gods in nonliving things, aliveness animism or a tendency to consider nonliving things as live entities, and agentic animisms or a tendency to attribute biological, artifactual, psychological, perceptual, and naming properties) and empathy. We found that friendship and morality were related to slightly different animism tendencies and empathy even though they shared some major factors. Aliveness animism, as well as a tendency to attribute perceptual and name properties toward robots, might be necessary for an individual to believe that robots could be social agents. Participants who responded that robots could be their friends showed a tendency to feel a soul in manmade objects and a strong self-oriented emotional reactivity, whereas participants who answered that robots were moral beings showed a tendency to exhibit strong emotional susceptibility. We discuss implications of these results and reasons why people feel that robots have a mind or consciousness. © 2019 ACM.","2019","2021-04-20 16:38:38","2021-04-20 16:38:38","","51-58","","","","","","","","","","","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","","English","","","","","","","","<p>cited By 4; Conference of 7th International Conference on Human-Agent Interaction, HAI 2019 ; Conference Date: 6 October 2019 Through 10 October 2019; Conference Code:155501</p>","","","Animism; Empathy; Human robot interaction; Major factors; Man made objects; Social agents; Surveys; University students","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Virtual embodiment by avatars allows social interaction with others using the full spectrum of verbal and non-verbal behaviour. Still, one’s avatar appearances is elective. Hence, avatars make it possible for users to discuss and exchange sensible or even problematic personal topics potentially hiding their real identity and hence preserving anonymity and privacy. While previous works identified similarities how participants perceive avatars compared to human stimuli, there is a question as to whether avatar-mediated self-disclosure is authentic and results in similar social responses. In the present study, we created a comparable stimulus set to investigate this issue and conducted an online study (N=172) for comparison. Our results indicate that avatars can be perceived as authentic and that empathy is attributed in similar level than to a human stimulus. In an exploratory model, we found that for in the overall results, authenticity fostered emotional empathy which in turn fostered pro-social intentions. We argue that avatars may serve as a valuable supporting medium for HCI applications related to mental well-being, self-disclosure, and support. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

However, its own development is encountering bottlenecks that it is unable to implement empathy with human emotions. So affective computing is getting more attention from researchers. In this paper, we propose an amygdala-inspired affective computing framework to realize the recognition of all kinds of human personalized emotions. Similar to the amygdala, the instantaneous emergency emotion is first computed more quickly in a low-redundancy convolutional neural network compressed by pruning and weight sharing with hashing trick. Then, the real-time process emotion is identified more accurately by the memory level neural networks, which is good at handling time-related signals. Finally, the intracranial emotion is recognized in personalized hidden Markov models. We demonstrate on Facial Expression of Emotion Dataset and the recognition accuracy of external emotions (including the emergency emotion and the process emotion) reached 85.72%.

The system is inspired by advances in biosensing wearables, tattoo displays, brain sensors, robotic agents, artificial intelligence (AI), gestural interaction and 3D holographic displays. By 2030, technological advances will enable us to prototype and investigate questions related to experiential and embodied emotional learning; emotion-based human-computer interaction, affective biosensing, empathetic AI agents, and 3D interactive holographic environments. We envision EmotoTent as a modular, emotion-sensing Holodeck. In the EmotoTent program children learn and practice emotion regulation and empathy with peers, pets and a robotic dog agent in ways that are experiential, embodied and playful. We propose EmotoTent as a core element of a K-6 socio-emotional learning curriculum designed to improve school culture through the enhancement of children's ability to regulate emotions and interact with human and non-human species with empathy and compassion. Enhancing these qualities has been shown to lead to reductions in violence and bullying, racism, gender inequality and other forms of marginalization.

BACKGROUND Meaningful recognition positively impacts nursing and organizational outcomes. The use of AI techniques such as natural language processing and machine learning to identify and describe behaviors impacting patient experiences is an emerging science. METHODS Nurse recognition comments were collected from a convenience sample of 3 organizations via an IPC inpatient platform and analyzed using the AI techniques of natural language processing, machine learning, sentiment analytics, and corollary dictionaries based on rules of linguistics. RESULTS The top theme of nursing recognition comments was courtesy and respect with the behaviors of empathy/compassion, helpfulness, kindness, attentiveness, and emotional comfort. The theme of skills/knowledge was the 2nd most common, with the behaviors of being professional, knowledgeable, keeping track, competence, dedication, and being thorough. CONCLUSIONS AI techniques for qualitative analysis of comments collected through IPC reveal nurse themes and behaviors most meaningful to patients and their family members.

Third, we include other basic principles which arise from the demands of empathy with humans.

The phases to be followed are described in this regard. We explain in detail the opportunity and the basic content of codes of conduct and committees and other control systems.

We evaluated an initial proof of concept automated feedback system that generates motivational interviewing quality metrics and provides easy access to other session data (e.g., transcripts). The system automatically provides a report of session-level metrics (e.g., therapist empathy) and therapist behavior codes at the talk-turn level (e.g., reflections).

A sample of 21 novice (n = 10) or experienced (n = 11) therapists each completed a 10-min session with a standardized patient. The system received the audio from the session as input and then automatically generated feedback that therapists accessed via a web portal.

Many diseases such as type II diabetes will no longer be considered as a single disease. Many familiar cancers such as cancer of liver or pancreas will have hundreds of subtypes whose management will be very different. The way we think about diseases will change. It will no longer be possible for clinicians to make a diagnosis, remember the names of diseases, the names of drugs or management protocols without the help of computers. As computer intelligence becomes more important than human intelligence in deciding diagnosis and treatment there will be a paradigm in the role of doctors. Internet, computers and social media will become more important than individuals in decision making. As a result, medicine will go more and more egalitarian (“wiki”) with increasing community participation in health decision making and management. A socialistic pattern will evolve over time globally as an adaptive reaction to the pressures put by artificial intelligence. This is because the individual differences in knowledge or intellect between human beings will become less apparent compared to the super powers of artificial intelligence. Qualities which are unique for humans such as compassion, empathy and emotional care will decide the professional success of future physicians even more than today. Today we are using artificial intelligence in diagnosis and prediction to help clinicians. Clinical algorithms and human experience cannot be replaced by machines. It will take many years to completely merge or replace humans with machines. However, we need to modify our medical education system in order to prepare the medical community and sensitize the society well in advance for a smooth transition. © 2019, Journal of Association of Physicians of India.

Internal motivational factors for studying medicine (e.g., care for patients, save lives) coupled with a deep approach to learning have been positively related to empathy in contrast to external motivational factors (e.g., future earning potential, prestige) and surface learning. However, assessments of these assumptions among medical school candidates are scarce. This study examined the relationship between different motivational factors and empathy among students enrolled in a selection year in medicine by testing the mediating role of learning approaches. A sample of 572 candidates for medical studies answered a self-reported questionnaire half way through their selection year. Measures included internal and external motivational factors for studying medicine, deep and surface learning approaches and empathy. Path-analysis tested the mediation effects of deep and surface approaches to learning on the relationship of internal and external motivational factors with empathy. The deep learning approach partially mediated the significant positive association between internal motivational factors and empathy, while the surface learning approach fully mediated the significant negative association between external motivational factors and empathy. These results suggest that learning approaches could be a pathway by which internal and external motives for studying medicine are related to empathy among medical school candidates.

In this regard, humanrobot interaction can be improved through the automatic perception of empathy, among other human attributes, allowing robots to affectively adapt their actions to interactants' feelings in any given situation. This paper presents our contribution to the generalised track of the One-Minute Gradual (OMG) Empathy Prediction Challenge by describing our approach to predict a listener's valence during semi-scripted actor-listener interactions. We extract visual and acoustic features from the interactions and feed them into a bidirectional long short-term memory network to capture the time-dependencies of the valence-based empathy during the interactions. Generalised and personalised unimodal and multimodal valence-based empathy models are then trained to assess the impact of each modality on the system performance. Furthermore, we analyse if intra-subject dependencies on empathy perception affect the system performance. We assess the models by computing the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) between the predicted and self-annotated valence scores. The results support the suitability of employing multimodal data to recognise participants' valence-based empathy during the interactions, and highlight the subject-dependency of empathy. In particular, we obtained our best result with a personalised multimodal model, which achieved a CCC of 0.11 on the test set. © 2019 IEEE.","2019","2021-04-20 16:38:39","2021-04-20 16:38:39","","","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","","","","","","<p>cited By 0; Conference of 14th IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition, FG 2019 ; Conference Date: 14 May 2019 Through 18 May 2019; Conference Code:149544</p>","","","Acoustic features; Correlation coefficient; Gesture recognition; Human robot interaction; Interpersonal relationship; Multimodal modeling; Multimodal models; Performance analysis; Short term memory; Subject dependencies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the present study, we combined functional neuroimaging with a robot socializing intervention to probe the flexibility of empathy, a core component of social relationships, towards robots. Twenty-six individuals underwent identical fMRI sessions before and after being issued a social robot to take home and interact with over the course of a week. While undergoing fMRI, participants observed videos of a human actor or a robot experiencing pain or pleasure in response to electrical stimulation. Repetition suppression of activity in the pain network, a collection of brain regions associated with empathy and emotional responding, was measured to test whether socializing with a social robot leads to greater overlap in neural mechanisms when observing human and robotic agents experiencing pain or pleasure. In contrast to our hypothesis, functional region-of-interest analyses revealed no change in neural overlap for agents after the socializing intervention. Similarly, no increase in activation when observing a robot experiencing pain emerged post-socializing. Whole-brain analysis showed that, before the socializing intervention, superior parietal and early visual regions are sensitive to novel agents, while after socializing, medial temporal regions show agent sensitivity. A region of the inferior parietal lobule was sensitive to novel emotions, but only during the pre-socializing scan session. Together, these findings suggest that a short socialization intervention with a social robot does not lead to discernible differences in empathy towards the robot, as measured by behavioural or brain responses. We discuss the extent to which long-term socialization with robots might shape social cognitive processes and ultimately our relationships with these machines.

Automated technologies are finding themselves more and more integrated into every aspect of the fight. As technology continues to advance, the United States Military must consider what a human-machine team will look like and how an optimal relationship between the two assets can be formed, especially under the stressful conditions that often characterize military contexts. For a human-machine team in a military context to work at maximum efficiency, an ideal level of empathy towards an automated teammate must be obtained. The goal of this study is to determine the effect stress can have on an individual's empathetic reaction toward a Pepper robot. Twenty-eight participants interacted with a Pepper robot either under stress or not. Empathy toward the robot was measured through subjective assessments as well as by participant decisions to continue interacting with Pepper even though doing so would harm the robot. Although not conclusive, the results suggest an interaction between participant gender and stress on empathy toward the Pepper robot. Women showed more empathy toward Pepper under higher levels of stress than lower levels of stress. However, the opposite was true for men. Men showed less empathy toward Pepper under higher levels of stress. The results of this study could help to inform military training and robot design. © 2019 IEEE.","2019","2021-04-20 16:38:39","2021-04-20 16:38:39","","","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","","","","","","<p>cited By 1; Conference of 2019 Systems and Information Engineering Design Symposium, SIEDS 2019 ; Conference Date: 26 April 2019; Conference Code:148712</p>","","","Automated technology; Human robot interaction; Human robots; Human-machine; Machine design; Maximum Efficiency; Military training; Robot designs; Subjective assessments","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our in-the-wild study found that people helped Sam for significantly longer when it adapted to match their background.

Although much work in human-robot interaction describes the meaningful relationships that humans forge with their robots in one-on-one encounters, when robots venture into places where humans cannot go - in search and rescue operations, ocean voyages, or even into space - they do so as part of a large human team. Decisions about what the robot should do and where it should go are therefore the result of large group interactions instead of individual human cognition: the realm of organizational sociology. This talk draws on over a decade of ethnography with NASA's robotic spacecraft missions, specifically focusing on the Mars Exploration Rover mission. Going behind the scenes of the mission, I show the meaning-making, emotional connections, and embodied synergy that scientists develop as they work with their robots millions of miles away on a daily basis. This begins by learning to see through the robots' 'eyes' on another planet, yet the peculiar social arrangement of mission work produces a deeper connection to the robot explorers too: one that is no doubt responsible for the extraordinary success and unexpected longevity of the mission team. Studying robotic spacecraft teams demonstrates how humans build a particular and peculiar empathy with their robotic colleagues that goes beyond anthropomorphism. Instead, this case points to the many and unusual ways in which organizations participate in our interactions with, understanding of, and ultimately care for the robots we work with in everyday life. © 2019 IEEE.","2019","2021-04-20 16:38:40","2021-04-20 16:38:40","","152","","","2019-March","","","","","","","","IEEE Computer Society","","English","","","","","","","ISSN: 21672148","<p>cited By 0; Conference of 14th Annual ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction, HRI 2019 ; Conference Date: 11 March 2019 Through 14 March 2019; Conference Code:146545</p>","","","Emotional connections; Human cognition; Human robot interaction; Man machine systems; Mars exploration rover missions; Martian surface analysis; Meaning makings; NASA; Robotic spacecrafts; Robotics; Scientific discovery; Search and rescue operations; Space flight; Teamwork","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The present research aimed to investigate the impact of occupational stereotypes, evoked by attire, as well as posture on person perception. For this, computer animation was used to create avatars with different types of attire (nurse, military, casual) and posture (open, closed). In Study 1 (N = 164), participants attributed significantly more empathy to avatars wearing a nurse versus a military uniform or casual outfit. When adding posture as an additional cue, Study 2 (N = 312) showed that ratings of empathy and dominance were affected by both attire and posture. This effect was replicated in Study 3 (N = 163) for female avatars, in the sense that open postures in nurses increased empathy ratings and decreased dominance ratings, which both in turn led to greater perceived competence. By contrast, for male avatars, posture did not affect attributions of competence directly. Rather, attire predicted perceived dominance directly, as well as through perceived empathy. The present findings suggest that both posture, and occupational information evoked by attire, are used to infer personal characteristics. However, the strength of each cue may vary with the gender of the target. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","2019","2021-04-20 16:38:40","2021-04-20 16:38:40","","23-38","","1","43","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: Springer New York LLC","<p>cited By 5</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We address two research questions: (1) Can an autonomous robot designed with empathic competencies foster collaborative learning in a group context? (2) Can an empathic robot sustain positive educational outcomes in long-term collaborative learning interactions with groups of students? To answer these questions, we developed an autonomous robot with empathic competencies that is able to interact with a group of students in a learning activity about sustainable development. Two studies were conducted. The first study compares learning outcomes in children across three conditions: learning with an empathic robot; learning with a robot without empathic capabilities; and learning without a robot. The results show that the autonomous robot with empathy fosters meaningful discussions about sustainability, which is a learning outcome in sustainability education. The second study features groups of students who interact with the robot in a school classroom for 2 months. The long-term educational interaction did not seem to provide significant learning gains, although there was a change in game-actions to achieve more sustainability during game-play. This result reflects the need to perform more long-term research in the field of educational robots for group learning. © 2019 ACM.","2019","2021-04-20 16:38:40","2021-04-20 16:38:40","","","","1","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","<p>cited By 19</p>","","","Agricultural robots; Collaborative learning; Educational robots; Field studies; Group learning; Learning Activity; Learning gain; Learning outcome; Research questions; Robots; Students; Sustainability education; Sustainable development","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Objective: This study aimed to explore general practitioners' (GPS') opinions about the potential impact of future technology on key tasks in primary care. Methods: In June 2018, we conducted a Web-based survey of 720 UK GPS' opinions about the likelihood of future technology to fully replace GPS in performing 6 key primary care tasks, and, if respondents considered replacement for a particular task likely, to estimate how soon the technological capacity might emerge. This study involved qualitative descriptive analysis of written responses (""comments"") to an open-ended question in the survey. Results: Comments were classified into 3 major categories in relation to primary care: (1) limitations of future technology, (2) potential benefits of future technology, and (3) social and ethical concerns. Perceived limitations included the beliefs that communication and empathy are exclusively human competencies; many GPS also considered clinical reasoning and the ability to provide value-based care as necessitating physicians' judgments. Perceived benefits of technology included expectations about improved efficiencies, in particular with respect to the reduction of administrative burdens on physicians. Social and ethical concerns encompassed multiple, divergent themes including the need to train more doctors to overcome workforce shortfalls and misgivings about the acceptability of future technology to patients. However, some GPS believed that the failure to adopt technological innovations could incur harms to both patients and physicians. Conclusions: This study presents timely information on physicians' views about the scope of artificial intelligence (AI) in primary care.

An inventive step is taken through the separation of computational resources based on whether the algorithms are addressing functional or experiential needs. The paper therefore addresses the requirement for new approaches that can be employed in the design of mobile robots to reduce cost, power consumption, and computational burden of the system. We propose that tasks requiring real-time and safety critical control are processed using dedicated on-board computers, whereas functionality dedicated to system optimization, machine learning and customization are handled through use a cloud-based platform.

We formalize the notions of Empathetic Planning and Empathetic Plan Recognition which are informed by the beliefs and affective state of the actor, and propose AI planning-based computational approaches.

Therefore, we proposed a counseling agent (CA) called CRECA (context respectful counseling agent), which listens to clients and promotes their reflection context respectfully namely in a context preserving way. This agent is now enhanced using a body language called 'unazuki' in Japanese, a kind of nodding to greatly promote dialogue, often accompanying 'un-un' (meaning 'exactly') of Japanese onomatopoeia. This body language significantly helps represent empathy or entire approval. Our agent is enhanced with such dialog promotion nodding robot to continue the conversation naturally or context respectfully towards clients' further reflection. To realize it, the robot nods twice at each end of dialog sentence input by clients. Here, we introduce a robot that behaves human-like by an appropriate nodding behavior. The motivation for such a more human-like robot was the extension of application fields from IT workers' counselling to people, who suffer from more social problems such as financial debt, or anxiety of victory or defeat. For such applications, it is important that the agent behaves as much as possible human-like. Here, we present an enhanced experimental evaluation. The quantitative evaluation is based on the utterance amounts of a test group of individuals. These amount with and without the nodding feature are compared.

The present study broadens the spectrum of the elements eliciting empathy that previous research has so far explored separately. Our research questions are: does the continuum represented by this set of elements elicit empathy? Is it possible to observe a linear decrease of empathy according to different features of the selected elements? More broadly, does empathy, as a construct, resist in front of the diversification of the element eliciting it? Results show that participants expressed empathy differently when exposed to three clusters of social actors being mistreated: they felt more sad, sorry, aroused and out of control for animals than for humans, but showed little to no empathy for objects. Interestingly, robots that looked more human-like evoked emotions similar to those evoked by humans, while robots that looked more animal-like evoked emotions half-way between those evoked by humans and objects.

Our experience, called BigBlueBot, consists of interactions with two chatbots in which breakdowns occur and the user (or chatbot) must recover using one or more repair strategies.

However, the traditional use of didactic lectures for communication skills training is ineffective, and the use of standardized patients is not time- or cost-effective. Given the abilities of virtual patients (VPs) to simulate interactive and authentic clinical scenarios in secured environments with unlimited training attempts, a virtual counseling application is an ideal platform for nursing students to hone their communication skills before their clinical postings. Objective: The aim of this study was to develop and test the use of VPs to better prepare nursing undergraduates for communicating with real-life patients, their family members, and other health care professionals during their clinical postings. Methods: The stages of the creation of VPs included preparation, design, and development, followed by a testing phase before the official implementation. An initial voice chatbot was trained using a natural language processing engine, Google Cloud's Dialogflow, and was later visualized into a three-dimensional (3D) avatar form using Unity 3D. Results: The VPs included four case scenarios that were congruent with the nursing undergraduates' semesters' learning objectives: (1) assessing the pain experienced by a pregnant woman, (2) taking the history of a depressed patient, (3) escalating a bleeding episode of a postoperative patient to a physician, and (4) showing empathy to a stressed-out fellow final-year nursing student. Challenges arose in terms of content development, technological limitations, and expectations management, which can be resolved by contingency planning, open communication, constant program updates, refinement, and training. Conclusions: The creation of VPs to assist in nursing students' communication skills training may provide authentic learning environments that enhance students' perceived self-efficacy and confidence in effective communication skills. However, given the infancy stage of this project, further refinement and constant enhancements are needed to train the VPs to simulate real-life conversations before the official implementation. © Shefaly Shorey, Emily Ang, John Yap, Esperanza Debby Ng, Siew Tiang Lau, Chee Kong Chui.","2019","2021-04-20 16:38:41","2021-04-20 16:38:41","","","","10","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: JMIR Publications Inc.","<p>cited By 8</p>","","","artificial intelligence; Artificial Intelligence; clinical competence; Clinical Competence; Communication; counseling; Counseling; Education; female; Female; human; Humans; interpersonal communication; Nursing; nursing education; procedures; virtual reality; Virtual Reality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The term Franken-algorithms has been used. Furthermore, there are concerns about driverless cars, automated General Practitioner Doctors (GPs) and robotic surgeons, legal expert systems, and particularly autonomous military drones. Digital Empathy grows when people and computers place themselves in each other’s shoes. Some would argue that for too long people have discriminated against computers and robots by saying that they are only as good as what we put into them. However, in recent times computers have outperformed people, beating world champions at the Asian game of Go (2017), Jeopardy (2011) and chess (1997), mastering precision in medical surgical operations (STAR) and diagnosis (Watson), and in specific speech and image recognition tasks. Computers have also composed music (AIVA), generated art (Aaron), stories (Quill) and poetry (Google AI). In terms of calling for more Digital Empathy between machines and people, we refer here to theories, computational models, algorithms and systems for detecting, representing and responding to people’s emotions and sentiment in speech and images but also for people’s goals, plans, beliefs and intentions. In reciprocation, people should have more empathy with machines allowing for their mistakes and also accepting that they will be better than people at performing particular tasks involving large data sets where fast decisions may need to be made, keeping in mind that they are not as prone as people to becoming tired. We conclude that if digital souls are programmed with Digital Empathy, and people have more empathy with them, by doing unto them as we would have them do unto us, this will help to secure Shelley’s monster. © 2019 CEUR-WS.

In contrast to industrial robots that, for example, may be used on an assembly line, social robots are designed specifically to interact with humans and/or other robots. People tend to perceive social robots as autonomous and capable of having a mind. As such, they are also more likely to be subject to social categorization by humans. As social robots become more human like, people may also feel greater empathy for them and treat robots more like (human) ingroup members. On the other hand, as they become more human like, robots also challenge our human distinctiveness, threaten our identity, and elicit suspicion about their ability to deceive us with their human-like qualities. We review relevant research to explore this apparent paradox, particularly from an intergroup relations perspective. We discuss these findings and propose three research questions that we believe social psychologists are ideally suited to address. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","2019","2021-04-20 16:38:41","2021-04-20 16:38:41","","","","8","13","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: Wiley-Blackwell","<p>cited By 4</p>","","","article; empathy; human; human experiment; identity; psychologist; robotics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Two dialog types were defined. First, the query type dialog was defined as a robot’s answer to human questioning. Second, the phatic type dialogs were defined to express the personality of the robot. While the former type dialog is initiated by formulated questioning, the latter type response can even be induced by misrecognition of human speech. Applying this simple method, the same unit sessions for each of the three classrooms on AI and robot were conducted. During the sessions, students’ burst of laughter was induced at 83% of the phatic type dialog, and the laughing response was found at 44% of the query type dialogs. By this representation, it became easier for the students to empathize with the robot. After this session, a questionnaire survey on the preference of robot pet, on what the students wanted to talk with the robot that dreams at night, and on their view of life if AI robots replaced human workers was conducted. The results suggested that the students got to imagine a virtual subjectivity of the intelligent machines and considered a better life for the human with them. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","2019","2021-04-20 16:38:41","2021-04-20 16:38:41","","494-506","","","11572 LNCS","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","ISBN: 9783030235598 Publisher: Springer Verlag","<p>cited By 0; Conference of 13th International Conference on Universal Access in Human-Computer Interaction, UAHCI 2019, held as part of the 21st International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction, HCI International 2019 ; Conference Date: 26 July 2019 Through 31 July 2019; Conference Code:228809</p>","","","Anthropomorphic robots; Elementary schools; Empathy; Human computer interaction; Humanoid robot; Humanoid robot NAO; Intelligent machine; Intelligent robots; Phatic dialog; Query processing; Questionnaire surveys; SIMPLE method; Students; Surveys; Virtual reality","","Antona M., Stephanidis C.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This article presents a new framework, the 3S Process, as a method for teaching leaders how to strategically adopt AI within their organizations. At a high-level, the 3S Process consists of three stages (Story, Strategy, and Solution), which are described in detail in the article. Stage 1: Story in the process is inspired by the Harvard Case Method to provide context for a problem. Stage 2: Strategy uses Design Thinking to produce candidate solutions. The substage of Empathy in Design Thinking plays a crucial role to reduce bias in designing AI. Virtualization technology is a tool for students to experience hands-on learning in prototype development. Stage 3: Solution is where students advocate for their conceptual AI solution in the context of the case study. AI is a type of complex system; therefore, students should consider feedback loops and the potential for unintended biases to enter a deployed solution. The presentation of the 3S Process in this article is conceptual. Further empirical studies, including evaluations of the 3S Process in classroom settings, will be considered in the future. © 2019 Carleton University.

Using our Performative Body Mapping (PBM) approach, we have developed a robotic object for studying how social meaning is enacted when movement qualities meet kinesthetic empathy. In this paper we introduce PBM and how it harnesses performers' kinesthetic imagination and movement expertise for designing the movement potential and movement qualities of abstract, non-humanlike robots. We then present our recent study of how the social presence of our robotic object-in-motion emerges in an encounter, involving experts from performance and design. Preliminary results of this study show that our robotic object can successfully convey movement qualities and their intended expressions as embodied by a dancer as part of the PBM process. Finally, we discuss how our observations can shift our focus from attributing qualities to the object to an emergence of qualities, propelled by the encounter. We believe our study provides a glimpse into the dynamic enactment of agency and how it requires both sides to 'give' for the robotic object's characteristics and the participants' experience to evolve. © 2019 AISB Convention.All right reserved.","2019","2021-04-20 16:38:41","2021-04-20 16:38:41","","31-37","","","","","","","","","","","The Society for the Study of Artificial Intelligence and Simulation of Behaviour","","English","","","","","","","","<p>cited By 1; Conference of 2019 Convention of the Society for the Study of Artificial Intelligence and the Simulation of Behaviour, AISB 2019 ; Conference Date: 16 April 2019 Through 18 April 2019; Conference Code:152955</p>","","","Body mappings; Co-presence; Emergent phenomenon; Human robots; Humanlike robots; Intrinsic property; Robotics; Robots; Social presence; Social robotics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

ER in Artificial Intelligence offers a growing number of problem-solving multidisciplinary opportunities. Most current AC and ER applications are focused on a somewhat controversial enterprise-centered approach, i.e., recognizing user emotions to enable a third-party to achieve its own goals, in areas such as e-commerce, cybersecurity, behavior profiling, user experience. In this work we propose to explore a human-centered research direction, aiming at using AC/ER to enhance user consciousness of emotional states, ultimately supporting the development of self-aid applications. The use of facial ER and text ER to help forms of assistive technologies in the fields of Psychotherapy and Communication is an example of such a human-centered approach. A general framework for ER in Self-aid is depicted, and some relevant application domains are suggested and discussed: dependencies treatment (DT) (e.g., workaholism, sexaholism); non-violent communication (NVC) for people in leading roles using e-mail or chat communication; empathy learning for parents and teachers in the circle-of-security (COS) caring environment. Far from being complete and comprehensive, the purpose of this work is to trigger discussions and ideas for feasible studies and applications of ER in self-aid, which we hope to see published in the future editions of our workshops, believing that it may be one of the drops needed in the ocean of a better world. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","2019","2021-04-20 16:38:41","2021-04-20 16:38:41","","391-404","","","11620 LNCS","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","ISBN: 9783030242954 Publisher: Springer Verlag","<p>cited By 4; Conference of 19th International Conference on Computational Science and Its Applications, ICCSA 2019 ; Conference Date: 1 July 2019 Through 4 July 2019; Conference Code:227949</p>","","","Affective Computing; Assistive technology; Behavioral research; Circle of security; Cobalt; Emotion recognition; Possible futures; Problem solving; Sexaholics; Speech recognition; User experience; Workaholics","","Misra S., Apduhan B.O., Gervasi O., Murgante B., Stankova E., Korkhov V., Torre C., Tarantino E., Rocha A.M.A.C., Taniar D.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, if you actually drop it you will need a lot of money. This study, we pay attention to innovation theory. In Japan, the study reported a long sales period. However, the study didn’t report a short sales period. Therefore, we report of a short sales period, especially food. This study, we call “High Sensitivity Layer” the innovators and the early adopters in innovation theory in term of to be interested in the innovation of products, sensitive to trends and constantly collecting new information by themselves and to have greater influence on other consumers. We think that those that collect a lot of empathy in the “High Sensitivity Layer” are diffusive in the innovators and the early adopters, and grab the characteristics of highly sensitive consumers who gather many empathies. I think that it may be able to fulfill the purpose of test marketing by seeing the response of new products of food to this consumer. We prepare a generalized model with a deep learning model and report features of highly sensitive consumers, visually and numerically clearly, using decision tree analysis from that model. From the analysis results, attached more images, and the older, the better it got a report that empathizes with sensitive consumers. When conducting test marketing, it is predicted that high-sensitivity consumers will be able to obtain preferable results by targeting people with this characteristic. Also, it was found that gender and emotion are not related to the characteristics of the person who writes the report sympathized with the consumer.

Although AI application brings in high efficiency, low labor cost and novelty, practical operation of robotic hotels still faces with challenges. This quantitative research aims at understanding the current user expectation level of AI robotic hotel and robot appliance. Based on that, it tries to make the user classification by demographic, behavioral and attitude factors. By using the refined SERVQUAL model, it gathers the expectation from five dimensions involving tangibles, reliability, responsiveness, assurance and empathy. These research objectives were realized by using survey-designed questionnaires and distributed by a snowball sampling method conducted in Beijing. After validity and reliability test, data collected from the field were analyzed by a variety of inspections. It is found that education, attitude and income level have a significant effect on the expectation to stay in the robotic hotel, which provided the basis of market position for robotic hotel operators. Through regression analysis, the model was established to identify what factors played an important part and how they worked. It is found that tangibles and responsiveness expectation significantly and positively contributed to increases in general user expectation to robotic hotels. This thesis drew up several conclusions, which would help industry players including hoteliers, AI robot suppliers better understand details of the user group in their decision-making process, as well as academic side to formulate a tailored model to evaluate the interaction between AI robots and hotel guests. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","2019","2021-04-20 16:38:42","2021-04-20 16:38:42","","350-366","","","11588 LNCS","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","ISBN: 9783030223342 Publisher: Springer Verlag","<p>cited By 2; Conference of 6th International Conference on HCI in Business, Government, and Organizations, HCIBGO 2019, held as part of the 21st International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction, HCI International 2019 ; Conference Date: 26 July 2019 Through 31 July 2019; Conference Code:228649</p>","","","Consumer behavior; Decision making; Decision making process; Hospitality; Hotels; Human computer interaction; Quality of service; Quantitative research; Regression analysis; Research objectives; Robotics; Robots; Service expectations; Service quality management; Surveys; User classification; User experience; User interfaces; Wages","","Nah F.F.-H., Siau K.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Furthermore, a transformation model is proposed to convert the obtained emotional behaviors into a specific robot's motion space. To validate the proposed approach, the models were evaluated by two example scenarios of interaction. The experimental results confirmed that the proposed approach endows a social robot with the capability to learn emotional behaviors from individual users, and to generate its emotional bodily expressions.

The results revealed that harmed versions of both robotic and human-like avatars were imbued with mind to a higher degree, irrespective of the baseline level of mind attributed to their unharmed counterparts. Perceptions of capacity for pain mediated attributions of experience, while both pain and empathy mediated attributions of abilities linked to agency.

For the first time, immersive virtual reality was used to place parents in the position of a child in order to assess impact on perspective-taking and empathy. This novel study was conducted with 20 non-high risk Spanish mothers (a pilot study with 12 mothers is reported in supplementary files). Mothers were virtually embodied as a 4-year-old child, experienced from the first-person perspective and with virtual and real body movements synchronised. They interacted with a 'mother avatar', which responded either in a Positive or Negative way. Participants reported a strong body ownership illusion for the child body that led to cognitive, emotional and physical reactions. Experiencing negative maternal behavior increased levels of empathy.

We then present our approach to equipping a robotic tutor with several empathic qualities, describing the technical architecture and its components, a map-reading learning scenario developed for an interactive multitouch table, as well as the pedagogical and empathic strategies devised for the robot. We also describe the results of a pilot study comparing the robotic tutor with these empathic qualities against a version of the tutor without them. The pilot study was performed with 26 school children aged 10-11 at their school. Results revealed that children in the test condition indeed rated the robot as more empathic than children in the control condition. Moreover, we explored several related measures, such as relational status and learning effect, yet no other significant differences were found.

As humans anthropomorphize robots, an empathetically interacting robot is expected to increase the level of acceptance of social robots. Here, a human perception experiment evaluates whether human subjects perceive empathy in robot speech. For this experiment, empathy is expressed only by adding appropriate emotions to the words in speech. Also, humans' preferences for a robot interacting with empathetic speech versus a standard robotic voice are also assessed. The results show that humans are able to perceive empathy and emotions in robot speech, and prefer it over the standard robotic voice. It is important for the emotions in empathetic speech to be consistent with the language content of what is being said, and with the human users' emotional state. Analyzing emotions in empathetic speech using valence-arousal model has revealed the importance of secondary emotions in developing empathetically speaking social robots. © 2018 IEEE.","2018","2021-04-20 16:38:42","2021-04-20 16:38:42","","632-637","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","","","","","","<p>cited By 7; Conference of 27th IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication, RO-MAN 2018 ; Conference Date: 27 August 2018 Through 31 August 2018; Conference Code:142166</p>","","","Behavioral research; Emotional state; Human perception; Human robot interaction; Human robot Interaction (HRI); Human subjects; Human users; Language content; Robotics; Social robots; Speech synthesis; Speech synthesizer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite significant progress towards the development of empathic social agents, current social robots have yet to reach the full emotional and social capabilities. This paper presents our recent effort on incorporating an automated Facial Expression Recognition (FER) system based on deep neural networks into the spoken dialog of a social robot (Ryan) to extend and enrich its capabilities beyond spoken dialog and integrate the user's affect state into the robot's responses. In order to evaluate whether this incorporation can improve social capabilities of Ryan, we conducted a series of Human-Robot-Interaction (HRI) experiments. In these experiments the subjects watched some videos and Ryan engaged them in a conversation driven by user's facial expressions perceived by the robot. We measured the accuracy of the automated FER system on the robot when interacting with different human subjects as well as three social/interactive aspects, namely task engagement, empathy, and likability of the robot. The results of our HRI study indicate that the subjects rated empathy and likability of the affect-aware Ryan significantly higher than non-empathic (the control condition) Ryan. Interestingly, we found that the accuracy of the FER system is not a limiting factor, as subjects rated the affect-aware agent equipped with a low accuracy FER system as empathic and likable as when facial expression was recognized by a human observer. © 2018 IEEE.","2018","2021-04-20 16:38:42","2021-04-20 16:38:42","","783-789","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","","","","","","<p>cited By 3; Conference of 27th IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication, RO-MAN 2018 ; Conference Date: 27 August 2018 Through 31 August 2018; Conference Code:142166</p>","","","Automation; Deep neural networks; Economic and social effects; Facial expression recognition; Facial Expressions; Human computer interaction; Human observers; Human robot interaction; Human robot Interaction (HRI); Human subjects; Social agents; Social robots; Spoken dialogs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Social cues are an important factor in this context. This work investigates, if emotional adaptation still works under absence of human-like facial Action Units. A human-robot dialog scenario is chosen using NAO pretending to work for a supermarket and involving humans providing object names to the robot for training purposes. In a user study, two conditions are implemented with or without explicit emotional adaptation of NAO to the human user in a between-subjects design. Evaluations of user experience and acceptance are conducted based on evaluated measures of human-robot interaction (HRI). The results of the user study reveal a significant increase of helpfulness (number of named objects), anthropomorphism, and empathy in the explicit emotional adaptation condition even without social cues of facial Action Units, but only in case of prior robot contact of the test persons. Otherwise, an opposite effect is found. These findings suggest, that reduction of these social cues can be overcome by robot experience prior to the interaction task, e.g. realizable by an additional bonding phase, confirming the importance of such from previous work. Additionally, an interaction with academic background of the participants is found. © 2018 IEEE.","2018","2021-04-20 16:38:42","2021-04-20 16:38:42","","275-281","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","","","","","","<p>cited By 3; Conference of 27th IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication, RO-MAN 2018 ; Conference Date: 27 August 2018 Through 31 August 2018; Conference Code:142166</p>","","","Behavioral research; Bonding phase; Facial action; Human robot interaction; Human robot Interaction (HRI); Human robots; Robotic interaction; Social behavior; Training purpose; User experience","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Major depression is associated with impaired psychosocial functioning and reduced quality of life. Challenges such as shortage of mental health personnel, long waiting times, perceived stigma, and lower government spends pose barriers to the alleviation of mental health problems. Face-to-face psychotherapy alone provides only point-in-time support and cannot scale quickly enough to address this growing global public health challenge. Artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled, empathetic, and evidence-driven conversational mobile app technologies could play an active role in filling this gap by increasing adoption and enabling reach. Although such a technology can help manage these barriers, they should never replace time with a health care professional for more severe mental health problems. However, app technologies could act as a supplementary or intermediate support system. Mobile mental well-being apps need to uphold privacy and foster both short-and long-term positive outcomes. Objective: This study aimed to present a preliminary real-world data evaluation of the effectiveness and engagement levels of an AI-enabled, empathetic, text-based conversational mobile mental well-being app, Wysa, on users with self-reported symptoms of depression. Methods: In the study, a group of anonymous global users were observed who voluntarily installed the Wysa app, engaged in text-based messaging, and self-reported symptoms of depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. On the basis of the extent of app usage on and between 2 consecutive screening time points, 2 distinct groups of users (high users and low users) emerged. The study used mixed-methods approach to evaluate the impact and engagement levels among these users. The quantitative analysis measured the app impact by comparing the average improvement in symptoms of depression between high and low users. The qualitative analysis measured the app engagement and experience by analyzing in-app user feedback and evaluated the performance of a machine learning classifier to detect user objections during conversations. Results: The average mood improvement (ie, difference in pre-and post-self-reported depression scores) between the groups (ie, high vs low users; n=108 and n=21, respectively) revealed that the high users group had significantly higher average improvement (mean 5.84 [SD 6.66]) compared with the low users group (mean 3.52 [SD 6.15]); Mann-Whitney P=.03 and with a moderate effect size of 0.63. Moreover, 67.7% of user-provided feedback responses found the app experience helpful and encouraging. Conclusions: The real-world data evaluation findings on the effectiveness and engagement levels of Wysa app on users with self-reported symptoms of depression show promise. However, further work is required to validate these initial findings in much larger samples and across longer periods. © Becky Inkster, Shubhankar Sarda, Vinod Subramanian.","2018","2021-04-20 16:38:42","2021-04-20 16:38:42","","","","11","6","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: JMIR Publications Inc.","<p>cited By 68</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One of the reasons for its increasing growth is the structural/market-level factors (known as media factors). Although India is a growing technology hub, there have been limited efforts to identify the media multitasking behaviour among the youth in this country. Thus, this study attempts to analyse the prevalence of media multitasking behaviour among the Indian college students and its relationship with their emotions through two methods: self-report and an android-based application known as ‘Affective Media Landscape Survey’ (AMLS). Previous studies have reported that continuous interaction with media diminishes face-to-face interaction, reduces empathy and increases the tendency to live in the virtual world. This raises the concern for emotional differences in everyday life, if any, between the high and low groups of media multitaskers. So the second objective of the study is to understand the emotional profile of the users that varies among media multitasking index. To achieve these objectives, the same two methods, the ‘self-report’ that involves questionnaires and AMLS (an android-based app to study the frequency of media multitasking behaviour and the emotions of the users) have been employed. The study gives an insight into the emerging behavioural patterns and hence is helpful for designing communities to cater to the growing needs of the young media users. © 2018 Mudra Institute of Communications, Ahmedabad, India.","2018","2021-04-20 16:38:42","2021-04-20 16:38:42","","197-211","","3","13","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: SAGE Publications Ltd","<p>cited By 3</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Revealing potential similarities in communicative exchanges in both groups when in contact with a human or a toy robot, the results might signify that emotional empathy requires the implication of an automatic identification. In this sense, emotional empathy might be considered a broad idiosyncrasy, a kind of synchronisation, offering the mind a peculiar form of communication.

These internal emotions act as motivation for learning to respond to the user in different situations, using the physical capabilities of the robot. This paper proposes a deep hybrid neural model for multi-modal affect recognition, analysis and behaviour modelling in social robots. The model uses growing self-organising network models to encode intrinsic affective states for the robot.

Dick’s empathy box from his novel Do Androids Dream of Electronic Sheep? [3]. In the novel, thousands of people were anonymously connected with each other both hap-tically and emotionally when they grabbed the handles of their empathy boxes. The Empathy Amulet similarly networks a group of strangers together through shared experiences of physical warmth. It is not yet another technology for staying in touch with people you already know (and falling short). Rather, it encourages its wearer to make a deliberate and generous choice to invest their time and energy in connection with strangers, and it incorporates reciprocity into its design, such that helping oneself means helping other people. In today’s world, people are less likely to feel empathy towards those not in their immediate network of family and friends, and, despite a proliferation of connective technologies, loneliness is on the rise [2, 5]. Surprisingly, it is the perceived sense of loneliness, and not actually being physically alone that has numerous health consequences for a significant portion of the population. Lakoff and Johnson’s theory of embodied mind asserts that our physical and subjective experiences are inextricably linked, and the Empathy Amulet leverages the powerful connection between the physical experience of warmth and the subjective experience of social connectedness to combat loneliness and cultivate a stronger sense of connection with strangers [1, 4].

Or, should it show sympathy and empathize with our situation? Although expression of caring and understanding is valued in supportive human communications, do we want the same from a chatbot, or do we simply reject it due to its artificiality and uncanniness? To answer this question, we conducted two experiments with a chatbot providing online medical information advice about a sensitive personal issue. In Study 1, participants (N = 158) simply read a dialogue between a chatbot and a human user. In Study 2, participants (N = 88) interacted with a real chatbot. We tested the effect of three types of empathic expression - sympathy, cognitive empathy, and affective empathy - on individuals' perceptions of the service and the chatbot. Data reveal that expression of sympathy and empathy is favored over unemotional provision of advice, in support of the Computers are Social Actors (CASA) paradigm. This is particularly true for users who are initially skeptical about machines possessing social cognitive capabilities.

On the other hand, this model replaces the batch learning self-organizing map with the dynamic cell structure, incrementally training a neural network model with a variety of emotional behaviors obtained from the users with whom the robot interacts. We demonstrate the validity of our incremental learning model through a public human action dataset, which will facilitate the acquisition of emotional body expression of socially assistive robots as a reflection of the individual user's culture. © 2018 IEEE.","2018","2021-04-20 16:38:43","2021-04-20 16:38:43","","377-382","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","","","","","","<p>cited By 1; Conference of 15th International Conference on Ubiquitous Robots, UR 2018 ; Conference Date: 27 June 2018 Through 30 June 2018; Conference Code:138974</p>","","","Batch learning; Behavioral research; Conformal mapping; Cultural backgrounds; Cultural traits; Emotional behavior; Facial Expressions; Human robot interaction; Incremental learning; Neural network model; Self organizing maps; Socially assistive robots","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The medical students of today will practice in a world where information technology is sophisticated and omnipresent. In this world, the tasks of memorization and analysis will be less important to them as practicing physicians. On the other hand, the nonanalytical, humanistic aspects of medicine-most importantly, the art of caring-will remain a critical function of the physician, and facility with improving systems of care will be required. Communication, empathy, shared decision making, leadership, team building, and creativity are all skills that will continue to gain importance for physicians. These skills should be further prioritized in medical school curricula to produce an even more effective physician for the future.","2018","2021-04-20 16:38:43","2021-04-20 16:38:43","","1105-1106","","8","93","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: NLM (Medline)","<p>cited By 19</p>","","","artificial intelligence; Artificial Intelligence; doctor patient relationship; empathy; Empathy; forecasting; Forecasting; human; Humans; Physician-Patient Relations; procedures; standards; trends","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Importantly, this neural mirroring is not constant; rather, it is modulated by our beliefs about their intentions, circumstances, and group allegiances. We investigated if the neural empathic response is modulated by minimally-differentiating information (e.g., a simple text label indicating another's religious belief), and if neural activity changes predict ingroups and outgroups across independent paradigms. We found that the empathic response was larger when participants viewed a painful event occurring to a hand labeled with their own religion (ingroup) than to a hand labeled with a different religion (outgroup). Counterintuitively, the magnitude of this bias correlated positively with the magnitude of participants' self-reported empathy. A multivariate classifier, using mean activity in empathy-related brain regions as features, discriminated ingroup from outgroup with 72% accuracy; the classifier's confidence correlated with belief certainty. This classifier generalized successfully to validation experiments in which the ingroup condition was based on an arbitrary group assignment. Empathy networks thus allow for the classification of long-held, newly-modified and arbitrarily-formed ingroups and outgroups. This is the first report of a single machine learning model on neural activation that generalizes to multiple representations of ingroup and outgroup. The current findings may prove useful as an objective diagnostic tool to measure the magnitude of one's group affiliations, and the effectiveness of interventions to reduce ingroup biases. © 2018 Vaughn, Savjani, Cohen and Eagleman.","2018","2021-04-20 16:38:43","2021-04-20 16:38:43","","","","","12","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: Frontiers Media S.A.","<p>cited By 3</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A growing number of electroencephalography studies also suggest that it might be useful to assess empathy. The main goal of this study was to use quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) to test whether observation of pain expressed by an avatar (virtual reality) induces a suppression of alpha waves over sensorimotor cortical areas, as it is observed with human stimuli. Not only was it the case, but also the magnitude of alpha suppression was correlated with perspective-taking capacity of participants. Both empathy levels and magnitude of sensorimotor alpha suppression (SAS) were significantly higher in women than men. Interestingly, a significant interaction emerged between levels of individual empathy and specificity of experimental instructions, where SAS in participants with good perspective-taking was higher during passive observation of the distressed avatar, while the opposite was true during an active (trying to understand) condition. These results suggest that: (1) synthetic characters are able to elicit SAS; (2) SAS is indeed associated with perspective-taking capacities; (3) Persons with poorer perspective-taking capacities can show significant SAS when proper instructions are provided. Therefore, qEEG represents a low-cost objective approach to measure perspective-taking abilities. © 2018 Joyal, Neveu, Boukhalfi, Jackson and Renaud.","2018","2021-04-20 16:38:43","2021-04-20 16:38:43","","","","","12","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: Frontiers Media S.A.","<p>cited By 5</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Meanwhile, counselors to help them are lack in number. To solve the problem, we proposed a counseling agent (CA) called CRECA (context respectful counseling agent). CRECA listens to clients and promotes their reflection context respectfully namely in a context preserving way. This agent can be enhanced using a body language called 'unazuki' in Japanese, a kind of 'nodding' to greatly promote dialogue, often accompanying 'un-un' (meaning 'exactly') of Japanese onomatopoeia. This body language is expected to significantly help represent empathy or entire approval. In this paper, the agent is integrated with such a 'unazuki' or 'dialog promotion nodding' robot to continue the conversation naturally or context respectfully towards clients' further reflection. To realize such 'unazuki', the robot nods twice at each end of dialog sentence input by clients. Here, we introduce our newly developed robot that behaves human-like by an appropriate nodding behavior. The main motivation for developing a more human-like robot was the extension of application fields from IT workers' counselling to people, who suffers from more social problems such as financial debt, or anxiety of victory or defeat. For such applications, it is often very important that the agent behaves as much as possible human-like. Finally, we present the experimental evaluation results that proves such nodding is effective in counseling. © 2017 IEEE.","2018","2021-04-20 16:38:44","2021-04-20 16:38:44","","56-62","","","2018-January","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","","","","","","<p>cited By 1; Conference of 13th International Conference on Signal-Image Technology and Internet-Based Systems, SITIS 2017 ; Conference Date: 4 December 2017 Through 7 December 2017; Conference Code:135826</p>","","","3D printers; Application fields; Counseling; Counseling agents; Dialog Promotion; Experimental evaluation; Machine design; Nodding; Psychological distress; Robots; Unazuki","","Dipanda A., Gallo L., Chbeir R., Nain N., Yetongnon K.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As relationships extend over long periods of time, sustained empathic behavior towards robots would be of interest. In order to measure user actions that may vary over time and are affected by empathy towards a robot teammate, we created the TEAMMATE simulation system. Our findings suggest that inducing empathy through a back story narrative can significantly change participant decisions in actions that may have consequences for a robot companion over time.

As the breath of robots applications requiring human interaction grow, it is important for robots to acquire sophisticated social skills such as empathy towards pain. However, it turns out that this is difficult to achieve without having an appropriate concept of pain that relies on robots being aware of their own body machinery aspects. This paper introduces the concept of pain, based on the ability to develop a state of awareness of robots own body and the use of the fault detection approach to generate artificial robot pain. Faults provide the stimulus and defines a classified magnitude value, which constitutes artificial pain generation, comprised of synthetic pain classes. Our experiment evaluates some of synthetic pain classes and the results show that the robot gains awareness of its internal state through its ability to predict its joint motion and generate appropriate artificial pain. The robot is also capable of alerting humans whenever a task will generate artificial pain, or whenever humans fails to acknowledge the alert, the robot can take a considerable preventive actions through joint stiffness adjustment. © 2017 IEEE.","2018","2021-04-20 16:38:44","2021-04-20 16:38:44","","694-699","","","2017-July","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","","","","","","<p>cited By 1; Conference of 2017 IEEE International Conference on Real-Time Computing and Robotics, RCAR 2017 ; Conference Date: 14 July 2017 Through 18 July 2017; Conference Code:135217</p>","","","Broad application; Detection approach; Fault detection; Health; Human interactions; Human robot interaction; Internal state; Joint motion; Joint stiffness; Machinery; Pattern recognition; Preventive action; Robotics; Social skills","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Participants were exposed to a virtual stranger asking to sit at the table (prosocial behavior) as well as a virtual waiter handing over the false drink (social avoidance). Empathy, interaction anxiety, social and physical presence as well as subjective stress levels were assessed to control for confounding influences. Empathy emerged as a significant predictor of prosocial behavior. Social avoidance, in turn, was not predicted by any of the included variables. Also, there was no effect of agency on social presence, physical presence, social interaction anxiety and stress. Yet, participants showed significantly more social avoidance and prosocial behavior towards avatars.

As part of our preliminary design stage, we conducted a interaction pilot study in the wild to explore and capture teens' initial interactions with a low-fidelity social robot prototype. We observed strong engagement and expressions of empathy from teens during our qualitative, interaction studies. © 2018 Authors.","2018","2021-04-20 16:38:44","2021-04-20 16:38:44","","69-70","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Computer Society","","English","","","","","","","ISSN: 21672148","<p>cited By 8; Conference of 13th Annual ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human Robot Interaction, HRI 2018 ; Conference Date: 5 March 2018 Through 8 March 2018; Conference Code:135192</p>","","","engagement; Human robot interaction; Human-centered designs; Interaction studies; Low fidelities; Machine design; Man machine systems; Pilot studies; Preliminary design; prototype; Robot interactions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper contributes with the first model on group-based emotions in social robotic partners. We defined a model of group-based emotions for social robots that allowed us to create two distinct robotic characters that express either individual or group-based emotions. This paper also contributes with a user study where two autonomous robots embedded the previous characters, and formed two human-robot teams to play a competitive game. Our results showed that participants perceived the robot that expresses group-based emotions as more likeable and attributed higher levels of group identification and group trust towards their teams, when compared to the robotic partner that expresses individual-based emotions. © 2018 ACM.","2018","2021-04-20 16:38:44","2021-04-20 16:38:44","","261-269","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Computer Society","","English","","","","","","","ISSN: 21672148","<p>cited By 25; Conference of 13th Annual ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction, HRI 2018 ; Conference Date: 5 March 2018 Through 8 March 2018; Conference Code:135041</p>","","","Behavioral research; Emotion; Group effects; Human robot interaction; Human robots; Identification (control systems); Inter-group; Man machine systems; Robotics; Self-categorisation; Trust","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This principle has been shown to be effective in games between humans and between humans and computer agents. We compared the social and cognitive engagement of children when playing checkers game combined with a social strategy against a robot or against a computer. We found that by combining the social and game strategy the children (average age of 8.3 years) had more empathy and social engagement with the robot since the children did not want to necessarily win against it. This finding is promising for using social strategies for the creation of long-term relations between robots and children and making educational tasks more engaging. An additional outcome of the study was the significant difference in the perception of the children about the difficulty of the game–the game with the robot was seen as more challenging and the robot–as a smarter opponent. This finding might be due to the higher perceived or expected intelligence from the robot, or because of the higher complexity of seeing patterns in three-dimensional world. © 2017 The Author(s).

Educators recognise that effective and active approaches to teaching are more closely associated with deeper learning. These active approaches aim to develop higher order skills, encouraging learners’ critical thinking and decision-making as well as enhancing their capacity to be agile, flexible and adaptable. Among those active approaches stand serious games, which are powerful learning environments that are seen as an emergent and engaging new way of experiment situations and construct knowledge. Serious games, in the form of role-play simulations, are scenario-based games that are used to simulate real life situations. Although serious games and simulations have been widely used in serving educational purposes, there is little evidence on their use in achieving deeper learning. In addition, there is lack of guidelines or a framework for designing serious games to support learners achieve deep learning. This paper proposes a theoretical framework, based on Bloom’s educational model for Mastery Learning, which illustrates the design of instructional process adapted for serious games using empathy and creativity as an approach of designing serious games for achieving deeper learning. It describes an approach of evaluating this framework by designing a serious game focusing on raising awareness about domestic violence and abuse. © 2018, Dechema e.V.

As people interact more often with voice and gesture controlled machines, they expect the machines to recognize different emotions, and understand other high level communication features such as humor, sarcasm and intention. In order to make such communication possible, the machines need an empathy module in them, which is a software system that can extract emotions from human speech and behavior and can decide the correct response of the robot. Although research on empathetic robots is still in the primary stage, current methods involve using signal processing techniques, sentiment analysis and machine learning algorithms to make robots that can ‘understand’ human emotion. Other aspects of human-robot interaction include facial expression and gesture recognition, as well as robot movement to convey emotion and intent. We propose Zara the Supergirl as a prototype system of empathetic robots. It is a software-based virtual android, with an animated cartoon character to present itself on the screen. She will get ‘smarter’ and more empathetic, by having machine learning algorithms, and gathering more data and learning from it. In this paper, we present our work so far in the areas of deep learning of emotion and sentiment recognition, as well as humor recognition. We hope to explore the future direction of android development and how it can help improve people’s lives. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.","2018","2021-04-20 16:38:45","2021-04-20 16:38:45","","173-193","","","9624 LNCS","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","ISBN: 9783319754864 Publisher: Springer Verlag","<p>cited By 1; Conference of 17th International Conference on Intelligent Text Processing and Computational Linguistics, CICLing 2016 ; Conference Date: 3 April 2016 Through 9 April 2016; Conference Code:212219</p>","","","Artificial intelligence; Behavioral research; Cartoon characters; Communication features; Computational linguistics; Customer services; Deep learning; Facial Expressions; Human computer interaction; Human robot interaction; Learning algorithms; Man machine systems; Prototype system; Robot movements; Sentiment analysis; Signal processing; Signal processing technique; Software systems; Speech communication; Text processing","","A, Gelbukh","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The main challenge of this paper is study whether people's empathic reactions towards robots change depending on previous information given to human about the robot before the interaction. The use of false data about robot skills creates different levels of what we call 'fake empathy'. This study performs an experiment in WOZ environment in which different subjects (n=17) interacting with the same robot while they believe that the robot is a different robot, up to three versions. Each robot scenario provides a different 'humanoid' description, and out hypothesis is that the more human-like looks the robot, the more empathically can be the human responses.

Positive results reinforce the strength of our hypothesis, although we recommend a new and bigger and then more robust experiment. © Copyright 2018, IGI Global.","2018","2021-04-20 16:38:45","2021-04-20 16:38:45","","44-59","","1","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: IGI Global","<p>cited By 3</p>","","","Basic emotions; Emotions; Empathy; Fake; Human response; Human robot interaction; Human robot Interaction (HRI); Man machine systems; Robot skills; Robots; Social relationships; Surveys; Video recording","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this situation, robots will require sophisticated capabilities, such as the ability to recognize human pain in advance and generate counter-responses as follow up emphatic action. Hence, it is important for robots to acquire an appropriate pain concept that allows them to develop these capabilities. This paper conceptualizes empathy generation through the realization of synthetic pain classes integrated into a robot's self-awareness framework, and the implementation of fault detection on the robot body serves as a primary source of pain activation. Projection of human shoulder motion into the robot arm motion acts as a fusion process, which is used as a medium to gather information for analyses then to generate corresponding synthetic pain and emphatic responses. An experiment is designed to mirror a human peer's shoulder motion into an observer robot. The results demonstrate that the fusion takes place accurately whenever unified internal states are achieved, allowing accurate classification of synthetic pain categories and generation of empathy responses in a timely fashion. Future works will consider a pain activation mechanism development. © 2018 the Author(s).","2018","2021-04-20 16:38:45","2021-04-20 16:38:45","","56-73","","1","5","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: AIMS Press","<p>cited By 2</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

If a robot can identify emotions and intentions of a human interacting with it, interactions with humans can potentially become more natural and effective. However, mechanisms of perception and empathy used by humans to achieve this understanding may not be suitable or adequate for use within robots. Electroencephalography (EEG) can be used for recording signals revealing emotions and motivations from a human brain. This study aimed to evaluate different machine learning techniques to classify EEG data associated with specific affective/emotional states. For experimental purposes, we used visual (IAPS) and physical (Tower of Hanoi) tasks to record human emotional states in the form of EEG data. The obtained EEG data processed, formatted and evaluated using various machine learning techniques to find out which method can most accurately classify EEG data according to associated affective/emotional states. The experiment confirms the choice of a method for improving the accuracy of results. According to the results, Support Vector Machine was the first, and Regression Tree was the second best method for classifying EEG data associated with specific affective/emotional states with accuracies up to 70.00% and 60.00%, respectively.

On the other hand, however, more complex technology and/or services inhibit users' satisfaction and,consequently,the intention to adopt SST, because such SST can instill fear in users. Nevertheless, at present, patients and other people who are interested in their own health and well-being are paying great attention to healthcare robots (as a form of SST)and,consequently, it has become crucial to investigate how these healthcare robots can positively influence users' satisfaction with them. Hence, this study aims to empirically investigate the factors that affect users' satisfaction with healthcare robots, especially in regard to human-robot interaction (HRI). Methods/Statistical analysis: We focused on the theory of heterophily and applied a series of factors identified in previous robot-adoption studies.Uniquely, this study focuses on users' heterophily with healthcare robots, examining heterophily through three fundamental ele-ments, empathy, professionalism, and personality, which we considered to be suitable fordetermining user satisfaction with HRI-based communication.To prove the validity of our hypotheses, we conducted an empirical testthat involved participants receiving a short health assessment from a robot. Findings: The findings of our empirical test supported our hypothesis that the lower the difference in empathy between a user and robot, the higher the level of user satisfaction with the humanoid-style healthcare service. Further, our results also suggest that heterogeneity between a user and healthcare robot is positively associated with user satisfaction. Improvements/Applications: First, to increase user satisfaction,robots must be provided with the ability to somehow recognizea user's personality and adjust their own accordingly before beginning the robot-based healthcare service. Secondly, users' behavior patterns should be analyzed by the healthcare robot. Overall, our study empirically shows the importance of ensuring thatprofessionalism is present in healthcare-domain-related HRI. © 2018 Ohbyung Kwon at.al.","2018","2021-04-20 16:38:45","2021-04-20 16:38:45","","68-75","","2","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: Science Publishing Corporation Inc","<p>cited By 0</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In fact, not only is it becoming apparent that quantum processes may regularly take place in biological systems, but these processes may underlie the mechanisms of consciousness and propel our models of conceptualizing the human brain into the next era of scientific understanding. The phenomena of consciousness have allured scientists and philosophers for thousands of years, while a precise technical understanding has remained elusive. If possible, developing this understanding will likely be one of humanity's greatest achievements. Knowing the fundamental processes that create conscious experience has far-reaching implications, from the potential birth of true artificial intelligence to a better understanding of mental health disorder etiologies and treatments. One major challenge in the mental health professions, and, ultimately, in empathy of any kind, is being able to see from and appreciate another person's unique, subjective experience.

The purpose of this study is to compare two models describing social-emotional behavior, one of which is based on a traditional machine learning algorithm, and the other on a cognitive architecture supporting social emotionality. It is hypothesized that the second model will be more efficient in eliciting user's empathy to a virtual cobot based on this model. Here the object of study is a virtual pet: a penguin. Two models controlling the pet were compared: a reinforcement learning model (a Q-learning algorithm) and the emotional cognitive architecture eBICA (Samsonovich, 2013). The second approach was based on a semantic map of pet's emotional states, that was constructed based on the human ranking. It is found that the eBICA model scores higher in participant's empathy compared to the model based on reinforcement learning. This article compares strengths and weaknesses of both methods. In conclusion, the findings indicate advantages of the approach based on eBICA compared to more traditional techniques.

Un-fortunately, many people cannot live with animals because of allergies, infection risk, or risk of damage to rental housing. To address these problems, some research groups have investigated robot-based psychotherapy. However, the important healing elements for therapy robots were not identified. Therefore, we conducted an Internet survey to determine the design elements of such a robot that might engender a healing mood and the functions that should be implemented. We assumed that a healing mood could be induced based on the interactive functions and appearance. To verify this hypothesis, we developed and evaluated a new interactive therapy robot. Next, we conducted interviews with individuals who interacted with a prototype therapy robot. The interviews revealed that the appearance of the robot was critical to engendering feelings of healing, comfort, and empathy. In addition, the size, softness, and comfort of the interactive therapy robot contributed to people feeling affection towards it. We also confirmed the importance of the robot appearing to listen to those who interacted with it. Our results should be useful for designing companion robots for therapy purposes. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.","2018","2021-04-20 16:38:46","2021-04-20 16:38:46","","66-83","","","10714 LNCS","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","ISBN: 9783319762692 Publisher: Springer Verlag","<p>cited By 1; Conference of 14th International Conference on Advances in Computer Entertainment Technology, ACE 2017 ; Conference Date: 14 December 2017 Through 16 December 2017; Conference Code:211429</p>","","","Animals; Companion robot; Design elements; Housing; Interactive functions; Internet survey; Machine design; Research groups; Risk of damage; Robots; Therapeutic effects; Therapeutic robots","","Inami M., Cheok A.D., Romao T., Cheok A.D.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, we could not provide feedback to cyberspace regarding the place, time, and target of a user realizing friendship since there is no technique for conveniently measuring the evocation of friendship during offline events. In this research, we propose a method of estimating the evocation of friendship using the similarity in the pulse rate variabilities (PRVs) of users when empathy is evoked between them. The user can be made aware of friendship estimated automatically through machine learning by wearing a wristwatch-type pulsimeter. CFs are more likely to evoke empathy than superficial friendships (SFs). To demonstrate the usefulness of this method, we conducted an experiment assuming an event where a group of four people are enjoying their time in an amusement park. From the experimental results, we showed that the similarity of the PRVs in CFs is greater than that in SFs when the favorability rating is high and the users like each other. Moreover, we showed that the proposed method estimated the evocation of friendship during the attraction experience with an f-measure of 0.74 at maximum and during an offline event with a mean f-measure of 0.78. The results showed the usefulness and effectiveness of this method. © MYU K.K.","2018","2021-04-20 16:38:46","2021-04-20 16:38:46","","1407-1426","","7","30","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: M Y U Scientific Publishing Division","<p>cited By 0</p>","","","Amusement parks; Artificial intelligence; Cyberspaces; Event-based; F measure; Favorability; Friendship; Internet of things; Learning systems; Pulse rate variability; Social network services; Social networking (online)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While basic design is focused on the development of new products for the individual, working towards a more sustainable world demands greater attention to designing for and with communities. Improving design education and examining design-learning outcomes requires a kind of targeted approach that could match the best practices to personalize student learning. Design is complex and design includes balancing the needs of multiple stakeholders. However, there is a gap in the preparation of design education that will be needed in a challenging environment. This paper reviews the history of design thinking in the engineering curriculum. Design thinking education starts with an understanding of its importance with socioeconomic relevance. Through observation and empathy, mapping the designer uses the listening and learning tools for mapping users unarticulated needs, working in a team environment. The designer takes time to think carefully why a certain project is considered and details which aspects of machine learning application can be applied from functional to complete success for the end users. The availability of powerful virtual reality methodologies, have made it possible to consider the realistic needs and visualize scenarios and to explore the design alternatives with new ideas before full scale resource allocation on new ideas. Mid-to-advanced level courses with experimental assignments require that students apply through experimentation the principles and concepts learned in foundation courses. The basic design tools such as axiomatic thinking, theory of inventive problem solving, design iteration and simulation using hardware-in-the loop are discussed with case studies. Consideration of product sustainability with the thoughts of design for disassembly and disposal has emerged as a major part of design thinking. Senior engineering courses center on cross and interdisciplinary design and capstone experiences so that students experience fully guided practice of device design and problem solving, simulating what they are likely to experience in the world. This paper examines the critical issues of design thinking in a curriculum from observation, empathy mapping, validation of the idea, and improvement of idea by virtual reality and machine learning, optimization of the idea by tools such as axiomatic design, hardware in the loop simulation, and finally examining product sustainability causes.

However, due to limited resources of health professionals, working alliance cannot always be promoted just-in-time in a ubiquitous fashion. To address this scalability problem, we investigate the direct effect of interpersonal closeness cues of text-based healthcare chatbots (THCBs) on attachment bond from the working alliance construct and the indirect effect on the desire to continue interacting with THCBs. The underlying research model and hypotheses are informed by counselling psychology and research on conversational agents. In order to investigate the hypothesized effects, we first develop a THCB codebook with 12 design dimensions on interpersonal closeness cues that are categorized into visual cues (i.e. avatar), verbal cues (i.e. greetings, address, jargon, T-V-distinction), quasi-nonverbal cues (i.e. emoticons) and relational cues (i.e. small talk, self-disclosure, empathy, humor, meta-relational talk and continuity). In a second step, four distinct THCB designs are developed along the continuum of interpersonal closeness (i.e. institutional-like, expert-like, peer-like and myself-like THCBs) and a corresponding study design for an interactive THCB-based online experiment is presented to test our hypotheses.

The departing assumption is that robotisation of warfare transforms military operations into automated industrial processes with the aim of removing empathy as a redundant ‘cost’. The development of autonomous weapons systems raises a number of sharp ethical controversies related to the projected moral insensitivity of robots regarding the treatment of enemies and civilian population. The futurist vision of war as a foreign policy instrument entirely ‘purified’ of the risk of morally wrong actions is in opposition with the negative effects of the use of drones. The author concludes that the use of lethal robots in combat would eventually remove enemy soldiers and civilians from the realm of ethical reasoning and deprive them of human dignity. Decision to kill in military operations ought to be based on human conscience as the only proper framework of making decisions by reasoning whether an action is right or wrong. © 2018, University of Belgrade - Institute for Philosophy and Social Theory.

I highlight three emerging areas of research with current research exemplars. First, simulating affect is necessary to enhance human-like relationships with technology; for example, with artificially intelligent virtual agents, or teachable robots as learning companions. Second, sensing and responding to learner affect in immersive learning experiences as well as learning at scale is rapidly evolving; for example, through affective intelligent tutoring systems, or dashboards driven by multimodal analytics. Third, designing technology-based learning experiences that promote, elicit and support affective outcomes requires theory building within the learning sciences; for example, to realize outcomes such as empathy or curiosity and formulate linkages to learning. Finally, I suggest how research in these areas of affective technology afford new opportunities to prepare learners for future learning and work environments. © ISLS.","2018","2021-04-20 16:38:46","2021-04-20 16:38:46","","1843-1846","","2018-June","3","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: International Society of the Learning Sciences (ISLS)","<p>cited By 0; Conference of 13th International Conference of the Learning Sciences, ICLS 2018: Rethinking Learning in the Digital Age: Making the Learning Sciences Count ; Conference Date: 23 June 2018 Through 27 June 2018; Conference Code:138742</p>","","","Advanced learning; Affective learning; Computer aided instruction; E-learning; Immersive learning; Intelligent robots; Intelligent tutoring system; Intelligent virtual agents; Learning companions; Learning science; Learning systems; Teaching; Technology-based learning; Work environments","","Luckin R., Kay J.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, given the wide use of this medium, emojis are now available in such a number and variety that every basic concept and mood is covered by at least one. For this reason, the connection between the emoji and its semantical meaning grows stronger. In this paper, we will be describing the work performed in order to develop a Machine Learning based tool that, given a tweet, predicts the most likely emoji associated with the text. The task resembles the one presented by Barbieri et al., [23], and is placed within the context of the International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval) 2018. We designed a baseline with standard Support Vector Machines and another baseline based on fastText, which was provided as part of the Workshop. In addition, we implemented several models based on Neural Networks such as Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks. We found that the latter is the most effective since it outperformed all our models and ranks in the 6th position out of 47 total participants. Our work aims to illustrate the potential of simpler models, which, thanks to the fine-tuning of hyper-parameters, could achieve accuracy comparable to the more complex models of the challenge. © 2018 CEUR-WS.

A model of empathy in engineering as a core skill, as a practice orientation and a professional way of being that can be taught in university programs has been proposed [1]. Does an emotional intelligence model of empathy need to be taught earlier than at the university level? The engineering design process has been included in the science standards for k-12 schools since 2013[2]. One of the purposes of this inclusion is the ability to reach a diverse population of students by applying real world problems in their curriculum. The design process typically includes the steps of defining the engineering problem, developing solutions and optimizing the design. Although the word ""empathy"" is not used, these problems are defined from an empathetic perspective as ""situations people want to change"" of ""social and global significance."" However, the standards do not discuss how to define a problem or how to teach empathy. In the winter of 2016 a study was conducted to evaluate the influence of empathy-based lessons on girls' interest in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). Some information is known about empathy in lessons. Girls may be more interested if lessons are altered to include an element of caring [3]. Other studies indicate children's empathy increases with type of media provided in lesson (computer versus robot) [4]. The study in this article was a qualitative case study of 50 children, grades 6, 7, and 8, boys and girls in an after-school 4-H Science Club. The lessons were conducted once per week. The lessons were previously conducted in an all-girls after-school STEM program with similar available inexpensive materials. Both schools had similar demographics. The students and coordinators(instructors) were observed, pre- and post-surveys were conducted, and interviews of both students and coordinators were audio and/or video-taped. Although responses varied by lesson, initial results indicate many students and coordinators did not understand the meaning of empathy situated in engineering design. © 2017 IEEE.","2017","2021-04-20 16:38:46","2021-04-20 16:38:46","","1-4","","","2017-October","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","","","","","ISSN: 15394565","<p>cited By 1; Conference of 47th IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE 2017 ; Conference Date: 18 October 2017 Through 21 October 2017; Conference Code:133822</p>","","","After-school science club; Design; Design process; Education computing; Emotional intelligence; Empathy; Engineering; Engineering and Mathematics; engineering and mathematics); Engineering design process; Middle school; Qualitative case studies; Science; Standards; STEM (science; Students; Teaching; technology; Technology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These claims are based on a moderated mediation model. They reported a three-way interaction between game condition, gender, and avatar identification when predicting masculine ideology in their original study. Masculine ideology was associated, in turn, with decreased empathy. However, there were no main experimental effects for video game condition on empathy. The current analysis considers the strength of the evidence for claims made in the original study on a sample of 153 adolescents (Mage = 16.812, SD = 1.241; 44.2% male). We confirmed that there was little evidence for an overall effect of game condition on empathy toward girls or women. We tested the robustness of the original reported moderated mediation models against other, theoretically derived alternatives, and found that effects differed based on how variables were measured (using alternatives in their public data file) and the statistical model used. The experimental groups differed significantly and substantially in terms of age suggesting that there might have been issues with the procedures used to randomly assign participants to conditions. These results highlight the need for preregistration of experimental protocols in video game research and raise some concerns about how moderated mediation models are used to support causal inferences. These results call into question whether use of “sexist” video games is a causal factor in the development of reduced empathy toward girls and women among adolescents. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","2017","2021-04-20 16:38:46","2021-04-20 16:38:46","","2446-2459","","12","46","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: Springer New York LLC","<p>cited By 9</p>","","","adolescent; aggression; Aggression; child; controlled study; crime victim; Crime Victims; empathy; experimental model; female; Female; girl; human; Humans; ideology; major clinical study; male; Male; masculinity; Masculinity; perception; psychology; sexism; Sexism; Social Perception; statistical model; theoretical model; video game; Video Games; violence; Violence; young adult; Young Adult","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Micro-expressions (subtle, rapid movements of muscles in and around the eyes and mouth in particular) are thus captured in a fine-grained, yet low- cost and low-tech alternative to established techniques. A future experiment will compare the emotive efficacy of the hybrid virtual agent with that of a conventional (fully CG) rigged avatar head in a 6DoF scenario that transitions from sympathetic (gauging empathy by self-report) to confrontational (gauging physiological arousal by heart-rate or GSR).

In this article, we examine the feasibility of creating companion robots that would seek to nurture a user’s empathy toward other human beings. As more and more computing devices subtly and overtly influence human behavior, it is important to draw attention to whether it would be ethically appropriate for roboticists to pursue this type of design pathway.

The behavior that would induce human-like feelings after long exposures is difficult to determine, and it often depends on the cultural background of the observers. Therefore, in this study, we generate an acting performance system for the android, in which an android and a human interact in a stage play in the real world. We adopt the theatrical theory called Contemporary Colloquial Theatre Theory to give the android natural behaviors so that audiences can comfortably observe it even after long-minute exposure. A stage play is created and shown in various locations, and the audiences are requested to report their impressions of the stage and their cultural and psychological backgrounds in a self-evaluating questionnaire. Overall analysis indicates that the audience had positive feelings, in terms of attractiveness, towards the android on the stage even after 20 min of exposure. The singularly high acceptance of the android by Japanese audiences seems to be correlated with a high animism tendency, rather than to empathy. We also discuss how the stage play approach is limited and could be extended to contribute to realization of human-robot interaction in the real world. © 2016 by the authors.","2017","2021-04-20 16:38:47","2021-04-20 16:38:47","","","","4","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: MDPI AG","<p>cited By 4</p>","","","Android theatre; Contemporary colloquial theatre theory; Cultural backgrounds; Human computer interaction; Human like robots; Human robot interaction; Long term exposure; Performance system; Robot theatres; Robots; Social robots; Theaters","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, it is noticed that most platforms use only a unique 3D avatar, and this character is responsible for all the reproduction of signals, with no alternative of choice for users. Such a limitation may have an impact on the acceptance of automatic translation by the deaf community, since there must be empathy of the deaf with the animated agent. Having only one available avatar makes impossible a more precise choice, which may involve personal characteristics and affinities. One of the reasons for this is the great effort, human and technological, that is necessary for the construction of a sign dictionary, which can scale proportionally with the addition of new avatars. In view of such a scenario, the present study aims to investigate mechanisms that allow multiple avatars to be offered in sign dictionaries without necessarily needing to reshape them again and manually, one by one. The initial premise is to analyze the functioning of each signal in a particular avatar, in order to predict possible problems in the reproduction of the signals after the permutation to a new one (retargeting), such as improper collisions or mesh invasions. As main contributions of the work, techniques are proposed to facilitate the identification and automatic correction of nonconformities in the movement of the signals and also some practical recommendations for the modeling of new avatars in order to minimize the occurrence of errors. © 2017 ACM.","2017","2021-04-20 16:38:47","2021-04-20 16:38:47","","325-332","","","","","","","","","","","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","","Portuguese","","","","","","","","<p>cited By 1; Conference of 23rd Brazillian Symposium on Multimedia and the Web, WebMedia 2017 ; Conference Date: 17 October 2017 Through 20 October 2017; Conference Code:131253</p>","","","Accessibility; Avatar; Computational linguistics; Computer aided language translation; Machine translations; Retargeting; Sign language; Space platforms; Three dimensional computer graphics; Translation (languages); Transportation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Mind perception also modulates the attitudes we have toward others, and determines the degree of empathy, prosociality, and morality invested in social interactions. Seeing mind in others is not exclusive to human agents, but mind can also be ascribed to non-human agents like robots, as long as their appearance and/or behavior allows them to be perceived as intentional beings. Previous studies have shown that human appearance and reliable behavior induce mind perception to robot agents, and positively affect attitudes and performance in human-robot interaction. What has not been investigated so far is whether different triggers of mind perception have an independent or interactive effect on attitudes and performance in human-robot interaction. We examine this question by manipulating agent appearance (human vs. robot) and behavior (reliable vs. random) within the same paradigm and examine how congruent (human/reliable vs. robot/random) versus incongruent (human/random vs. robot/reliable) combinations of these triggers affect performance (i.e., gaze following) and attitudes (i.e., agent ratings) in human-robot interaction. The results show that both appearance and behavior affect human-robot interaction but that the two triggers seem to operate in isolation, with appearance more strongly impacting attitudes, and behavior more strongly affecting performance. The implications of these findings for human-robot interaction are discussed. © 2017 Abubshait and Wiese.","2017","2021-04-20 16:38:47","2021-04-20 16:38:47","","","","AUG","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: Frontiers Media S.A.","<p>cited By 34</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the future, we may face a different but related problem: That we might create (or cause the creation of) beings that not only satisfy but exceed these criteria. The question becomes whether these are minimal criteria, or hierarchical, such that those who fulfill them to greater degree should be afforded greater consideration. This article questions the validity and necessity of drawing divisions among beings that satisfy the minimum requirements for personhood; considering how future beings - intelligent androids, synthezoids, even alternate-substrate sentiences - might fit alongside the baseline human. I ask whether these alternate beings ought to be considered different to us, and why this may or may not matter in terms of a notion of human community. The film Blade Runner, concerned in large part with humanity and its key synthezoid antagonist Roy Batty, forms a framing touchstone for my discussion. Batty is stronger, faster, more resilient, and more intelligent than Homo sapiens. His exploits, far beyond the capability of normal humans, are contrasted with his frailty and transient lifespan, his aesthetic appreciation of the sights he has seen, and his burgeoning empathy.

However, RAT using humanoid robots is still a novel practice for which the adhesion mechanisms, indications and benefits remain unclear. Also, little is known about how the robot's behavioral and affective style might promote engagement of persons with dementia (PwD) in RAT. The present study sought to investigate the use of a humanoid robot in a psychomotor therapy for PwD. We examined the robot's potential to engage participants in the intervention and its effect on their emotional state. A brief psychomotor therapy program involving the robot as the therapist's assistant was created. For this purpose, a corpus of social and physical behaviors for the robot and a ""control software"" for customizing the program and operating the robot were also designed. Particular attention was given to components of the RAT that could promote participant's engagement (robot's interaction style, personalization of contents). In the pilot assessment of the intervention nine PwD (7 women and 2 men, M age = 86 y/o) hospitalized in a geriatrics unit participated in four individual therapy sessions: one classic therapy (CT) session (patient- therapist) and three RAT sessions (patient-therapist-robot). Outcome criteria for the evaluation of the intervention included: participant's engagement, emotional state and well-being; satisfaction of the intervention, appreciation of the robot, and empathy-related behaviors in human-robot interaction (HRI). Results showed a high constructive engagement in both CT and RAT sessions. More positive emotional responses in participants were observed in RAT compared to CT. RAT sessions were better appreciated than CT sessions. The use of a social robot as a mediating tool appeared to promote the involvement of PwD in the therapeutic intervention increasing their immediate wellbeing and satisfaction. © 2017 Rouaix, Retru-Chavastel, Rigaud, Monnet, Lenoir and Pino.","2017","2021-04-20 16:38:48","2021-04-20 16:38:48","","","","JUN","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: Frontiers Media S.A.","<p>cited By 13</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This may interfere with the ability of a patient's family, friends and healthcare practitioners to understand what it is like to live with CP, or to even believe it exists. A reluctance by or ability of others to believe a CP patient may in turn exacerbate pain and sequelae common in CP, such as depression, frustration, stigma or social isolation. The goal of this research is to help foster empathy of what CP patients experience by designing and evaluating a body-sensing video game titled AS IF. In this game, players ""inhabit"" a virtual body or avatar of a CP patient. The virtual body simulates physical limitations and displays red areas meant to indicate painful areas. A pilot study with 15 participants was conducted. Results show that while not every aspect of the game proved successful, players had a significant increase in their willingness to help patients. This research demonstrates an approach that may help foster empathy towards CP patients through an embodied game simulation, and has design implications for future research and gameplay explorations. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.","2017","2021-04-20 16:38:48","2021-04-20 16:38:48","","244-250","","","","","","","","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","","English","","","","","","","","<p>cited By 3; Conference of 11th EAI International Conference on Pervasive Computing Technologies for Healthcare, PervasiveHealth 2017 ; Conference Date: 23 May 2017 Through 26 May 2017; Conference Code:115071</p>","","","Body-Sensing Games; Chronic pain; Embodied Simulation; Empathy; Gaming For A Purpose; Health care; Human computer interaction; Interactive computer graphics; Serious games; Ubiquitous computing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We compared self-report ratings of the multidimensional scale of PSS (MSPSS) among age- and IQ-matched groups of adults (18–58 years) with cognitively high-functioning ASD (N = 41), or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; N = 69), and neurotypical controls (NC; N = 69). Accompanying group comparisons, we used machine learning random forest (RF) analyses to explore predictors among a range of psychopathological and socio-emotional variables. Relative to both ADHD and NC, adults with ASD showed lower MSPSS ratings, specifically for the friends subscale (MSPSS-f). Across ASD and ADHD, interindividual differences in autism severity, affective empathy, symptoms of anxiety related to social interactions, hyperactivity/impulsivity, and somatization best predicted MSPSS-f. These relationships did not differ between clinical groups. While group comparisons demonstrated greater impairment in individuals with ASD, analyzing individuals' characteristics revealed cross-diagnoses similarities in regard to their MSPSS-f relationships.

Correspondingly, drift measurements in science are used as a means of rating the intensity of a body-ownership illusion via which a participant in a controlled experiment perceives that an extracorporeal appendage, or virtual whole-body avatar is incorporated as part of one’s own body schema. In this research article, I will examine an applied performance by BeAnotherLab utilising the anti-disciplinary collective’s The Machine to Be Another as part of Good Chance’s Encampment project–this telepresence system produces a VR body illusion intended to increase empathy and reduce proximity between an immersant’s real body and that of a volunteer refugee counterpart. When scientifically-tested body illusions cross a paradigmatic boundary to be framed as immersive art, what are the ethical implications? Furthermore, are these kinds of virtual proprioceptive transactions across different kinds of social and political boundaries symptomatic of radical empathic acts, or a capitalistic desire for the acquisition of another’s experiences by virtual means? This article examines illusory bodily inhabitation through a Levinasian critical lens to consider the ethics of deterritorializing the immersant’s gaze and referring their sense of touch elsewhere to produce ‘narrative immersion’. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","2017","2021-04-20 16:38:48","2021-04-20 16:38:48","","30-37","","3","22","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: Routledge","<p>cited By 1</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The existence of an implicit mentalizing system has generated considerable debate however, centered on the ability of various experimental paradigms to demonstrate unambiguously such mentalizing. Evidence for implicit mentalizing has previously been provided by the 'dot perspective task,' where participants are slower to verify the number of dots they can see when an avatar can see a different number of dots. However, recent evidence challenged a mentalizing interpretation of this effect by showing it was unaltered when the avatar was replaced with an inanimate arrow stimulus. Here we present an extension of the dot perspective task using an invisibility cloaking device to render the dots invisible on certain trials. This paradigm is capable of providing unambiguous evidence of automatic mentalizing, but no such evidence was found. Two further well-powered experiments used opaque and transparent goggles to manipulate visibility but found no evidence of automatic mentalizing, nor of individual differences in empathy or perspective-taking predicting performance, contradicting previous studies using the same design. The results cast doubt on the existence of an implicit mentalizing system, suggesting that previous effects were due to domain-general processes. © 2016 The Author(s).","2017","2021-04-20 16:38:48","2021-04-20 16:38:48","","454-465","","3","43","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: American Psychological Association Inc.","<p>cited By 34</p>","","","adolescent; Adolescent; adult; Adult; female; Female; human; Humans; male; Male; middle aged; Middle Aged; physiology; psychomotor performance; Psychomotor Performance; theory of mind; Theory of Mind; vision; Visual Perception; young adult; Young Adult","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It should also try to establish a social empathic relation with the user. To this aim, it is crucial to endow the robot with the capability of recognizing the user’s affective state and reason on it for triggering the most appropriate communicative behavior. In this paper we describe how such an affective reasoning has been implemented in the NAO robot for simulating empathic behaviors in the context of AAL. In particular, the robot is able to recognize the emotion of the user by analyzing communicative signals extracted from speech and facial expressions. The recognized emotion allows triggering the robot’s affective state and, consequently, the most appropriate empathic behavior. The robot’s empathic behaviors have been evaluated both by experts in communication and through a user study aimed at assessing the perception and interpretation of empathy by elderly users. Results are quite satisfactory and encourage us to further extend the social and affective capabilities of the robot. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","2017","2021-04-20 16:38:48","2021-04-20 16:38:48","","5073-5094","","4","76","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: Springer New York LLC","<p>cited By 15</p>","","","Affective Computing; Affective state; Ambient assisted living (AAL); Assistive robots; Elderly users; Empathy; Facial Expressions; Hardware; Multimedia systems; Robots; Task-oriented","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It has similarly been suggested that poetry writing offers students a way to express their feelings and emotions related to clinical issues, medical education, and their relationship with patients. The rhythmic structure and temporal organisation of poetry allow students to remember poetry more easily than prose, suggesting that important and detailed information could be better memorised through poetic text. To report on how poetry writing and reciting was used in a PBL class in nursing to enhance the students' artistic ability, and on the students' perspectives on artistry in their learning. This paper presented a part of results of a main educational study where data were collected through lesson observations, reflective notes, and a follow-up interview. A total of 17 Hong Kong students were encouraged to collaborate in groups and write English poems based on a clinical case. A content analysis was conducted on their reflective notes and narratives were extracted from an interview. Although the students learned about cooperation, creativity, thinking, stress management, how to make lively presentations, deep learning, long-term memory, and professional knowledge, they expressed that the above were indirectly related to artistry. Scholars from the fields of both health related disciplines and literature should collaborate in researching and developing some learning and teaching activities which can further enhance the students' artistic ability so as to let them learn about empathy and understand patients' sufferings and illness experiences. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","2017","2021-04-20 16:38:48","2021-04-20 16:38:48","","37-44","","1","16","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: Walter de Gruyter GmbH","<p>cited By 2</p>","","","clinical article; content analysis; creativity; empathy; follow up; Hong Kong; human; interview; literature; long term memory; narrative; nursing; problem based learning; professional knowledge; stress management; teaching; writing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In our previous studies, we have focused only on the robot's emotional state. However, the emotional state of the other party is also an important factor for smooth conversation in human society. Therefore, the robot partner has two emotional structures for human: empathy and robot emotion. First, human empathy uses a perceptual based emotion model to know the human's emotional state based on the sensory information. Next, we propose a recurrent simple spike response model to improve the robot's emotional model, and we apply ""Hebbian-LMS"" learning to modify the weights in the spiking neural network. The robot's emotional state is calculated by using the human's emotional information, internal and external information. The robot partner can use the emotional results to control the facial and gesture expression. The utterance style is also changed by the robot's emotional state. As a result, the robot partner can interact emotionally and naturally with human. First, we explain the related works and the development of the robot partner ""iPhonoid-C"". Next, we define the architecture of the emotional model to realize emotional empathy towards human. Then, we discuss the algorithms and the methods for developing the emotional model.

For artificial agents without emotional intelligence might generate behavior that is misinterpreted, unexpected, and confusing to humans, violating human expectations and possibly causing emotional harm. Surprisingly, there is a dearth of investigations aimed at understanding the extent to which artificial agents need emotional intelligence for successful interactions. Here, we present the first study in the perception of emotional intelligence (EI) in robots vs. humans. The objective was to determine whether people viewed robots as more or less emotionally intelligent when exhibiting similar behaviors as humans, and to investigate which verbal and nonverbal communication methods were most crucial for human observational judgments. Study participants were shown a scene in which either a robot or a human behaved with either high or low empathy, and then they were asked to evaluate the agent’s emotional intelligence and trustworthiness. The results showed that participants could consistently distinguish the high EI condition from the low EI condition regardless of the variations in which communication methods were observed, and that whether the agent was a robot or human had no effect on the perception. We also found that relative to low EI high EI conditions led to greater trust in the agent, which implies that we must design robots to be emotionally intelligent if we wish for users to trust them. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","2017","2021-04-20 16:38:49","2021-04-20 16:38:49","","129-141","","","10498 LNAI","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","ISBN: 9783319674001 Publisher: Springer Verlag","<p>cited By 10; Conference of 17th International Conference on Intelligent Virtual Agents, IVA 2017 ; Conference Date: 27 August 2017 Through 30 August 2017; Conference Code:197079</p>","","","Artificial agents; Behavioral research; Communication method; Emotional intelligence; Human perception; Human robot interaction; Intelligent robots; Intelligent virtual agents; Machine design; Non-verbal communications; Robots; Social interactions","","O'Sullivan C., Leite I., Castellano G., Kopp S., Beskow J., Peters C.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Digital games show some unique properties that make them valuable for inducing social change. Some of the game elements that can be used to integrate values are as follows: Narration, which is one of the elements that is most obvious to players and is part of most of today's digital games, is a proper way of presenting human rights topics and can also include ideological messages. However, there are also other ways of creating empathy for certain groups as the example of Ayitii - The Cost of Life shows: If players feel responsible for the game characters, games can make players think about the topic presented. Being able to take meaningful decisions which influence the player's avatar, other non-playable characters, the narration or the game-world is a property of many recent games. Thus, ethical decisions are included in games and put players into the shoes of those who are oppressed or put in other situations where there is no easy way of deciding if something is right or wrong. Finally, the article also discusses if these serious games can affect players' real lives and change their way of thinking and attitudes. The serious game This War of Mine shows that some players think about their decisions and the topic of the game even after having stopped playing. However, there are also restrictions to transferring game contents into players' lives and induce social change. Quite often it is not enough just to play the game, teaching which must take place in a non-game context, is needed to make players aware of human rights (violations).","2017","2021-04-20 16:38:49","2021-04-20 16:38:49","","191-196","","","","","","","","","","","Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited","","English","","","","","","","","<p>cited By 2; Conference of 11th European Conference on Games Based Learning, ECGBL 2017 ; Conference Date: 5 October 2017 Through 6 October 2017; Conference Code:131756</p>","","","Computer games; Digital games; Empathy; Game contents; Game elements; Human computer interaction; Human rights; Interactive computer graphics; Serious games; Social aspects; Social changes; Video game","","Pivec M., Grundler J.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Head motion synchrony analysis revealed a leader-follower relationship for the reactive model and a mutual entrainment of head motion for the interactive model. Also, questionnaire survey results showed the degree of empathy for interactive condition was significantly higher as compared with reactive and unreactive conditions. In addition, the degree of naturalness for interactive condition was significantly higher as compared with unreactive condition. Hence, these indicate that empathy was shared through mutual entrainment of head motion, which could provide a smooth interface in human-robot communication. This system would be extended to elderly adults as an assistive system for the elderly's rehabilitation. © 2016 The Society of Instrument and Control Engineers - SICE.","2016","2021-04-20 16:38:49","2021-04-20 16:38:49","","1514-1519","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","","","","","","<p>cited By 0; Conference of 55th Annual Conference of the Society of Instrument and Control Engineers of Japan, SICE 2016 ; Conference Date: 20 September 2016 Through 23 September 2016; Conference Code:124992</p>","","","Aging population; Communication robot; Developing countries; Head motion; Human computer interaction; Human robot interaction; Human-robot communication; Interactive modeling; Questionnaire surveys; Robots; Smooth interface; Surveys; Synchronization; Synchronization systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This model is based on the heat conduction equation in heat-transfer engineering, and has been developed to enhance empathy during embodied interaction in avatar-mediated communication.

Currently, there are many devices that allow gathering biometric measurements from human beings, such as EEG Headsets or Health Bracelets. The massive data sets generated by tracking of EEG and physiology may be used, among other things, to infer knowledge about human moods and emotions. Apart from direct biometric signal measurement, eye tracking systems are nowadays capable of determining the point of gaze of the users when interacting in ICT environments, which provides an added value research on many different areas, such as psychology or marketing. We present a process in which devices for eye tracking, biometric, and EEG signal measurements are synchronously used for studying both basic and complex emotions. We selected the least intrusive devices for different signal data collection given the study requirements and cost constraints, so users would behave in the most natural way possible. On the one hand, we have been able to determine basic emotions participants were experiencing by means of valence and arousal. On the other hand, a complex emotion such as empathy has also been detected. To validate the usefulness of this approach, a study involving forty-four people has been carried out, where they were exposed to a series of affective stimuli while their EEG activity, biometric signals, and eye position were synchronously recorded to detect self-regulation. The hypothesis of the work was that people who self-regulated would show significantly different results when analyzing their EEG data. Participants were divided into two groups depending on whether Electro Dermal Activity (EDA) data indicated they self-regulated or not. The comparison of the results obtained using different machine learning algorithms for emotion recognition shows that using EEG activity alone as a predictor for self-regulation does not allow properly determining whether a person in self-regulation its emotions while watching affective stimuli. However, adequately combining different data sources in a synchronous way to detect emotions makes it possible to overcome the limitations of single detection methods. © 2016 López-Gil, Virgili-Gomá, Gil and García.","2016","2021-04-20 16:38:50","2021-04-20 16:38:50","","","","AUG","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: Frontiers Media S.A.","<p>cited By 24</p>","","","arousal; Artificial intelligence; autoregulation; Biometric informations; Biometric measurements; Biometrics; controlled study; Deregulation; dermis; electroencephalogram; Electroencephalography; Emotions; empathy; Empathy; exposure; eye position; eye tracking; Eye tracking systems; Eye tracking technologies; Eye-tracking; gaze; human; human experiment; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; machine learning; marketing; Physiological models; Physiological response; Physiology; recognition; Signal detection; Speech recognition; stimulus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this article in order to analyze human behaviors in social context, we propose a new approach which explores interrelations between body part motions in scenarios with people doing a conversation. The novelty of this method is that we analyze body motion-based features in frequency domain to estimate different human social patterns: Interpersonal Behaviors (IBs) and a Social Role (SR). To analyze the dynamics and interrelations of people's body motions, a human movement descriptor is used to extract discriminative features, and a multi-layer Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) technique is proposed to model the existent dependencies. Laban Movement Analysis (LMA) is a well-known human movement descriptor, which provides efficient mid-level information of human body motions. The mid-level information is useful to extract the complex interdependencies. The DBN technique is tested in different scenarios to model the mentioned complex dependencies. The study is applied for obtaining four IBs (Interest, Indicator, Empathy and Emphasis) to estimate one SR (Leading).The obtained results give a good indication of the capabilities of the proposed approach for people interaction analysis with potential applications in human-robot interaction. © 1979-2012 IEEE.","2016","2021-04-20 16:38:50","2021-04-20 16:38:50","","1679-1691","","8","38","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: IEEE Computer Society","<p>cited By 11</p>","","","algorithm; Algorithms; Automated; automated pattern recognition; Bayes theorem; Bayes Theorem; Bayesian approaches; Bayesian networks; Behavioral research; Complex networks; Frequency domain analysis; Frequency domains; human; Human movement analysis; Human robot interaction; Humans; Man machine systems; Models; motion; Motion; Movement; movement (physiology); Network layers; Pattern Recognition; Robots; Signal processing; social behavior; Social Behavior; Social roles; Social sciences; Social signal processing; Statistical; statistical model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using participatory design, our aim was to understand factors related to adoption and acceptance of behavioral intervention technology as part of daily life. Two challenges of living with HIV led to an empathy-driven approach in our design process: (1) HIV is a stigmatized condition, which (2) disproportionately affects the marginalized populations of young African American men who have sex with men and transgender women. We discuss five empathy-driven design strategies: positive and nonjudgmental tone; minimal, avatar-based gamification; motivational and corny messages; nondisclosure through neutral signifiers; and social support through camaraderie. Our approach enabled us to identify and work through factors, often related to stigma and marginalization, which would lead to rejection of TreatYoSelf use in daily life. © 2016 EAI.","2016","2021-04-20 16:38:50","2021-04-20 16:38:50","","","","","2016-May","","","","","","","","ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social-Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering","","English","","","","","","","ISSN: 21531633","<p>cited By 12; Conference of 10th EAI International Conference on Pervasive Computing Technologies for Healthcare, PervasiveHealth 2016 ; Conference Date: 16 May 2016 Through 19 May 2016; Conference Code:138076</p>","","","African American; Behavior change; Behavioral interventions; Design strategies; Ecological momentary intervention; Medication adherence; mHealth; Participatory design; Smart-phone applications; Ubiquitous computing","","Favela J., Hoey J., Matic A., Fitzpatrick G., Weibel N.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Method: From the perspective of a theoretical opening both phenomenological and psychoanalytic, auto-empathy is the process in which, taking the position of the ""other-in-oneself"", we represent our subjective world - or the all states of our subjectivity (actions, emotions, thoughts) - by an empathic relationship with ourselves. The auto-empathy relationship is a process of distancing, and symbolic appropriation, in which we are divided into halves, implementing our innate ability to be both subject and object for ourselves. Results: The mediatization of auto-empathy in digital worlds can put ourselves instead of a figure that represents us - our avatar - so that our empathy is turned towards ourselves indirectly. This second time of empathy for a virtual figure of the self, called ""mediatized auto-empathy"" or ""virtual auto-empathy"", would contribute thirdly to the development of empathy for oneself. Finally, the development of empathy for others would be supported in a fourth time, by the attention the players are paying to each other in network games. Discussion: These four hypotheses, illustrated by clinical cases, open an interrogation concerning the frame of the psychoanalytical work. In the adolescent, the work of virtualisation, which consists in the creative anticipation of its subjective possibilities, seems regularly impeded. The mental duplicity is no longer in a position to operate a symbolizing distance between the real self and the virtual self, between the subjective self and the subjectivising self. The other-in-oneself is ineffective in proposing to the adolescent an empathic dialogue with oneself. Consequently, the autorepresentation flirts with the seizure, in particular in the subjective states of breaks. Nevertheless, the digital spaces could be indirect media of appropriation of subjective experiences for the teenager. Conclusion: Our reflections led us to think of auto-empathy as the realization of the other-in-oneself which allows us to represent our own subjective world. The auto-empathy mediatized by an avatar can thus be described as a representation by empathy of our subjective part that contains this character. From then on, the space of the video game appears as a space of subjectivation. © 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.","2016","2021-04-20 16:38:50","2021-04-20 16:38:50","","293-308","","2","81","","","","","","","","","","French","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Masson SAS","<p>cited By 6</p>","","","adolescence; Article; auto empathy; empathy; human; psychoanalysis; self concept; virtual reality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is a common scenario in modern computer games, where players interact with NPCs assuming the guise of human characters. To explore this question, an online game was developed in which a human player had a primary objective of surviving against increasingly difficult waves of enemies. As a secondary objective, the player was tasked with protecting an unarmed NPC companion which assumed either a human, or non-human identity, but with identical underlying Artificial Intelligence. The intention was to explore whether the human player would be more or less protective of a synthetic companion simply due to the identity assumed. The results of the study demonstrate that player's behavior does change based on identity, and clearly indicates that the player was more protective of the companion assuming a human identity. Furthermore, the results show that this phenomenon extends beyond simple human and non-human identities, and that the specific persona, or gender of the NPC may influence the player's empathy towards it. © 2015 IEEE.","2016","2021-04-20 16:38:50","2021-04-20 16:38:50","","145-152","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","","","","","","<p>cited By 1; Conference of International Conference on Cyberworlds, CW 2015 ; Conference Date: 7 October 2015 Through 9 October 2015; Conference Code:119374</p>","","","Artificial intelligence; CASA; Computer games; Human agent interactions; Human identity; Human players; Identity; Intelligent agents; Interactive computer graphics; Internet; Non-player character; On-line games; Primary objective","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our ongoing important challenges are to discover our own truly meaningful personal happiness with the aid of AI and personal genome technologies. We have been developing a personal genome information agent entitled MyFinder, which supports searching for our inherited talents and maximizes our potential for a meaningful life. In the MyFinder project, we have provided a crowd-sourced DIY (Do it yourself) genomics research platform and conducted various ""citizen science"" projects in health and wellness. In this paper, we discuss how machine learning technologies and personal genome informatics might contribute to happiness sciences. We introduce the ""Social Intelligence Genomics and Empathy-Building Study"" and report the preliminary results of applying deep learning and six other machine learning algorithms for predicting social intelligence levels from nine SNPs genetic profiles. We discuss the possibilities and limitations of applying machine learning technologies for personal happiness trait prediction. We also discuss future AI challenges in the context of wellbeing computing. Copyright © 2016, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

There is an ongoing effort to find a HIP that is secure enough yet easy for humans. Recently, a new HIP has been designed aiming at higher security: the Civil Rights Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart (CAPTCHA). It employs the empathy capacity of humans to further strengthen Securimage, a well-known text CAPTCHA. In this paper, we analyze it from a security perspective, finding fundamental design flaws. Using several well-known machine learning (ML) algorithms, we analyze to what extent these flaws affect its security. We discover that thanks to them, we can create a successful side-channel attack. This attack is able to correctly solve the HIP on 20.7% of occasions, much more than enough to consider it broken. Thus, we show that there is no need to solve the problem of optical character recognition nor empathy analysis for computers to break this particular HIP. ML can be successfully used to break a HIP that uses both with a side-channel attack. This security analysis can be applied to other HIPs. It will allow to test whether they are leaking too much information by unexpected ways, given non-evident design flaws.

These robots vary in their appearance and behavior. Since these two factors can have an impact on lasting human-robot relationships, it is important to understand their effect for companion robots. We have conducted an experiment that evaluated the impact of a robot's appearance and its behaviour in repeated interactions on its perceived empathy, trustworthiness and anxiety experienced by a human. The results indicate that a highly humanlike robot is perceived as less trustworthy and empathic than a more machinelike robot. Moreover, negative behaviour of a machinelike robot reduces its trustworthiness and perceived empathy stronger than for highly humanlike robot. In addition, we found that a robot which disapproves of what a human says can induce anxiety felt towards its communication capabilities. Our findings suggest that more machinelike robots can be more suitable as companions than highly humanlike robots. Moreover, a robot disagreeing with a human interaction partner should be able to provide feedback on its understanding of the partner's message in order to reduce her anxiety. © 2016 Jakub Złotowski et al., published by De Gruyter Open.","2016","2021-04-20 16:38:50","2021-04-20 16:38:50","","55-66","","1","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: De Gruyter Open Ltd","<p>cited By 13</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We start from the hypothesis that the robots, in order to become personal companions need to know how to empathic interact with human beings. To validate our research, we have used the proposed system with the minimalistic humanoid robot Telenoid. We have conducted human-robot interactions test with elderly people with no prior interaction experience with robot. During the experiment, elderly persons engaged a stimulated conversation with the humanoid robot. Our goal is to overcome the state of loneliness of elderly people using this minimalistic humanoid robot capable to exhibit a dialogue similar to what usually happens in real life between human beings.

In motivational interviewing, it is desirable for the counselor to communicate empathy towards the client to promote better therapy outcomes. In this paper, we propose a deep neural network (DNN) system for predicting counselors' session level empathy ratings from transcripts of the interactions. First, we train a recurrent neural network mapping the text of each speaker turn to a set of task-specific behavioral acts that represent local dynamics of the client-counselor interaction. Subsequently, this network is used to initialize lower layers of a deep network predicting session level counselor empathy rating. We show that this method outperforms training the DNN end-to-end in a single stage and also outperforms a baseline neural network model that attempts to predict empathy ratings directly from text without modeling turn level behavioral dynamics.

This study investigates the generation of a variety of backchannel forms appropriate for the dialogue context, using the corpus of counseling dialogue. At first, we annotate all acceptable backchannel form categories considering the permissible variation in backchannels. Second, we analyze how the morphological form of backchannels relates to linguistic features of the preceding utterance such as the utterance boundary type and the linguistic complexity. Based on this analysis, we conduct machine learning to predict backchannel form from the linguistic and prosodic features of the preceding context. This model outperformed a baseline which always outputs the same form of backchannels and another baseline which randomly generates backchannels. Finally, subjective evaluations by human listeners show that the proposed method generates backchannels more naturally and gives a feeling of understanding and empathy. © 2016, Transactions of the Japanese Society for Artificial Intelligence.

However, selection in a great number of medical schools worldwide is still based on knowledge exams, a procedure that might neglect students with needed personal characteristics for future medical practice. We investigated whether the personal profile of students selected through a knowledge-based exam differed from those not selected. Methods: Students applying for medical school (N=311) completed questionnaires assessing motivations for becoming a doctor, learning approaches, personality traits, empathy, and coping styles. Selection was based on the results of MCQ tests. Principal component analysis was used to draw a profile of the students. Differences between selected and non-selected students were examined by Multivariate ANOVAs, and their impact on selection by logistic regression analysis. Results: Students demonstrating a profile of diligence with higher conscientiousness, deep learning approach, and task-focused coping were more frequently selected (p=0.01). Other personal characteristics such as motivation, sociability, and empathy did not significantly differ, comparing selected and non-selected students. Conclusion: Selection through a knowledge-based exam privileged diligent students.

One of the robots used in this study called MARC (See Fig. 1) was given a series of biased behaviours such as forgetting participant’s names, denying its own faults for failures, unable to understand what a participant is saying, etc. Such fallible behaviours were compared to a non-biased baseline behaviour. In the current paper, we present a comparison of two case studies using these biases and a non-biased algorithm.

Humor support is defined as the conversational strategies used in reaction to humor utterances. This paper aims at exploring the phenomenon of responses to humor interventions from the robot through the examination of a corpus. We assume that using humor in human-robot interaction sets up a positive atmosphere in which participants are willing to contribute. This study relies on 49 human-robot interaction dialogues and 381 adjacency pairs of humorous acts made by the robot and the following human responses. The human humor responses, elicited through canned jokes and conversational humor, were annotated. Three main categories of human responses were found (1) providing no support, (2) recognizing the attempt of humor and (3) contributing with more humor. The findings indicate that, as in human-human interaction, strategies of humor support are strongly dependent of the humorous event’s context. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","2016","2021-04-20 16:38:51","2021-04-20 16:38:51","","305-316","","","9749","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","ISBN: 9783319398617 Publisher: Springer Verlag","<p>cited By 4; Conference of 18th International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction, HCI International 2016 ; Conference Date: 17 July 2016 Through 22 July 2016; Conference Code:177779</p>","","","Dialog systems; Empirical studies; Human computer interaction; Human response; Human robot interaction; Human-human interactions; Man machine systems; Multi-modal; Robots; Social human-robot interactions; Social skills; Verbal response","","Streitz N., Markopoulos P.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite several studies on when to backchannel, most of the current spoken dialogue systems generate the same pattern of backchannels, giving monotonous impressions to users. In this work, we investigate generation of a variety of backchannel forms according to the dialogue context. We first show the feasibility of choosing appropriate backchannel forms based on machine learning, and the synergy of using linguistic and prosodic features. For generation of backchannels, a framework based on a set of binary classifiers is adopted to effectively make a ""not-to-generate"" decision. The proposed model achieved better prediction accuracy than a baseline which always outputs the same backchannel form and another baseline which randomly generates backchannels. Finally, evaluations by human subjects demonstrate that the proposed method generates backchannels as naturally as human choices, giving impressions of understanding and empathy.

We focused on the pupil response which is closely related to human affect, and developed an embodied communication system in which an interactive CG character generates the pupil response as well as communicative actions and movements such as nodding and body movements by speech input. In addition, it was confirmed that the pupil response is effective for supporting the embodied interaction and communication using the developed system.

Could training with virtual human teammates empower you to speak up to a bullying teammate? Could virtual teammates change the way you speak as to reduce errors? How about learn new patient safety policies or efficiently transfer care? In this talk, we will explore the emerging area of using virtual humans to subtly influence healthcare teams' teamwork and communication skills. This application of virtual humans could have significant patient safety impact as teamwork and communication is the top reason for adverse events in critical care areas, such as the emergency room, intensive care unit, and operating room. We will examine the latest research into simulating healthcare teams with mixed reality humans. Mixed reality humans are virtual humans that can share the same physical space as the user. These virtual humans combine interactive graphics, natural language processing, artificial intelligence, human-computer interaction, and data mining to create in situ learning experiences. In these learning experiences, critical care personnel can work to improve teamwork with life-sized interactive virtual team-mates [1]. These learning experiences can also help implement best-practices to address address difficult teamwork concepts such as authority gradients, conflict negotiation, empathy and critical thinking [2][3]. Our research team (Samsun Lampotang, Anesthesia Department, University of Florida, Adam Wendling, Anesthesia Department, University of Florida, and Casey White, College of Medicine, University of Virginia) has developed VR hardware and software platforms to create compelling experiences for users to work on teams with mixed reality humans (MRHs). MRHs are virtual humans that can inhabit the user's physical space [4]. The MRH virtual team members can respond to the user's speech and actions and respond with natural speech and gestures. The virtual team members cannot physically interact with the environment. However, they can present realistic personalities and role-play the roles of operating room teammates, such as surgeons, anesthesiologists, nurses, and surgical technicians. The virtual team members combine the benefits of dynamic visuals of virtual humans with the physicality of mannequins (Figure 1). (Figure Presented) The virtual teammates are composed of comprise a minitower desktop for computation, networking, and rendering, a 40′ TV for display, and a Microsoft Kinect® (version 2) for tracking. All of these components are mounted onto a TV stand. Additionally, a Sennheiser DW-Pro 1 wireless headset is used for speech capture. ANDI's torso, arms, and head are rendered using a virtual human model from Autodesk's Character Generator. The virtual teammate's legs were physical and were composed of shoes and pants filled with stuffing. The physical props were used to integrate the virtual teammate into the user's space. A series of studies evaluated the social presence impact of ANDI design decisions and the current system configuration was shown to provide a virtual teammate with which participants reported a high sense of presence [5]. The virtual teammates' audio responses are pre-recorded by voice talent, and gestures are generated using motion capture and professionally key-framed animations. The virtual teammates can gaze at whoever is speaking, and intermittently glance at the other team members. They also blink and mimic idle motions when not speaking. We will examine results from studies evaluating the perception of virtual teammates, lessons learned in integrating such systems into hospital training, and areas for future research. © 2016 IEEE.","2016","2021-04-20 16:38:52","2021-04-20 16:38:52","","615-616","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","","","","","","<p>cited By 0; Conference of 2016 International Conference on Collaboration Technologies and Systems, CTS 2016 ; Conference Date: 31 October 2016 Through 4 November 2016; Conference Code:126763</p>","","","Anesthesiology; Communication skills; Computer graphics; Data mining; E-learning; Hardware and software; Health care; Human computer interaction; In situ processing; Intensive care units; NAtural language processing; Natural language processing systems; Nursing; Operating rooms; Personnel training; Rendering (computer graphics); System configurations; Team training; University of Florida; University of Virginia; Virtual humans; Virtual reality","","Smari W.W., Natarian J.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We measure the effects of lifelike movement and stories on people's hesitation to strike the robot, and we evaluate the relationship between hesitation and people's trait empathy. Our results show that people with a certain type of high trait empathy (empathic concern) hesitate to strike the robots. We also find that high empathic concern and hesitation are more strongly related for robots with stories. This suggests that high trait empathy increases people's hesitation to strike a robot, and that stories may positively influence their empathic responses. © 2015 IEEE.","2015","2021-04-20 16:38:52","2021-04-20 16:38:52","","770-775","","","2015-November","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","","","","","","<p>cited By 38; Conference of 24th IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication, RO-MAN 2015 ; Conference Date: 31 August 2015 Through 4 September 2015; Conference Code:116986</p>","","","Human robot interaction; Man machine systems; Robots","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

((2010) A realistic, virtual head for human-computer interaction. Interact. Comput., 22, 176-192, ISSN 0953-5438), in this paper we describe a method for dynamic recognition of displayed facial emotions on low-resolution streaming images. First, we address the detection of action units (AUs) of the facial action coding system using active shape models and Gabor filters. Normalized outputs of the AU recognition step are then used as inputs for a neural network that consists of an habituation network plus a competitive network. Both the competitive and the habituation layer use differential equations, thus taking into account the dynamic information of facial expressions through time. Experimental results carried out on live video sequences and on the Cohn-Kanade face database show that the proposed method provides high recognition hit rates. To assess the suitability of the developed emotional recognition system for human-computer interaction applications, it has been successfully integrated in the architecture of an avatar and we have conducted a preliminary experiment on empathy. The experiment showed promising results, as the avatar that made use of the emotional recognition system obtained a clear increase in the positivity of the rating when compared with the same avatar with no emotional response. © 2013 The Author.

We found that the descending phase of the P3 component was larger for the painful stimuli than the non-painful stimuli, regardless of whether the hand belonged to a human or robot. In contrast, the ascending phase of the P3 component at the frontal-central electrodes was increased by painful human stimuli but not painful robot stimuli, though the interaction of ANOVA was not significant, but marginal.

In the current study, we explored the relationship between visuospatial perspective taking and self-report measures of the cognitive and emotional components of empathy in young adults. To this aim, we employed a priming paradigm, in which the presence of an avatar allowed to anticipate the next perceived perspective on the visual scene. We found that the emotional dimension of empathy was positively correlated with the behavioral advantage provided by the presence of the avatar, relative to unprimed perspective changes. These data suggest a link between the tendency to vicariously experience the others’ emotions and the ability to perform self–other spatial transformations. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","2015","2021-04-20 16:38:52","2021-04-20 16:38:52","","2091-2102","","7","233","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: Springer Verlag","<p>cited By 8</p>","","","adult; Adult; analysis of variance; Analysis of Variance; Article; behavior; cognition; computer interface; correlational study; depth perception; emotion; Emotions; empathy; Empathy; female; Female; human; Humans; male; Male; personal experience; personality; Personality; Photic Stimulation; photostimulation; physiology; priority journal; self report; Self Report; Space Perception; spatial memory; Spatial Memory; spatial memory test; statistics; Statistics as Topic; User-Computer Interface; young adult; Young Adult","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, we conducted an exploratory study to empirically examine children’s perceptions toward the computer- and robot-mediated AR systems designed to make dramatic play activities interactive and participatory. A multi-disciplinary expert group consisting of early childhood education experts, preschool teachers, AR specialists, and robot engineers collaborated to develop a learning scenario and technological systems for dramatic play. The experiment was conducted in a kindergarten setting in Korea, with 81 children (aged 5–6 years old). The participants were placed either in the computer-mediated AR condition (n = 40) or the robot-mediated AR condition (n = 41). We administered an instrument to measure children’s perceived levels of the following variables: (a) satisfaction (i.e., interest in dramatic play & user-friendliness), (b) sensory immersion (i.e., self-engagement, environment-engagement & interaction-engagement), and (c) media recognition (i.e., collaboration with media, media function & empathy with media). Data analysis indicates that children in the robot-mediated condition showed significantly higher perceptions than those in the computer-mediated condition regarding the following aspects: interest in dramatic play (satisfaction), interactive engagement (sensory immersion), and empathy with media (media recognition). Furthermore, it was found that the younger-aged children and girls, in particular, perceived AR-infused dramatic play more positively than the older-aged children and boys, respectively. The contribution of this study is to provide empirical evidence about the affordances of robots and AR-based learning systems for young children. This remains a relatively unexplored area of research in the field of learning technologies. Implications of the current study and future research directions are also discussed. © 2015, Association for Educational Communications and Technology.","2015","2021-04-20 16:38:52","2021-04-20 16:38:52","","455-474","","3","63","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: Springer New York LLC","<p>cited By 50</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The challenge stems partly from the complexity and fluidity of this social process, but also from its covert nature. One powerful tool to enhance experimental control over such dynamic social interactions has been the use of avatars in virtual reality (VR); information about an individual in such an interaction can be collected through the analysis of his or her neurophysiological and behavioral responses. We have developed a unique platform, the Empathy-Enhancing Virtual Evolving Environment (EEVEE), which is built around three main components: (1) different avatars capable of expressing feelings and emotions at various levels based on the Facial Action Coding System (FACS); (2) systems for measuring the physiological responses of the observer (heart and respiration rate, skin conductance, gaze and eye movements, facial expression); and (3) a multimodal interface linking the avatar’s behavior to the observer’s neurophysiological response. In this article, we provide a detailed description of the components of this innovative platform and validation data from the first phases of development. Our data show that healthy adults can discriminate different negative emotions, including pain, expressed by avatars at varying intensities. We also provide evidence that masking part of an avatar’s face (top or bottom half) does not prevent the detection of different levels of pain. This innovative and flexible platform provides a unique tool to study and even modulate empathy in a comprehensive and ecological manner in various populations, notably individuals suffering from neurological or psychiatric disorders. © 2015 Jackson, Michon, Geslin, Carignan and Beaudoin.","2015","2021-04-20 16:38:52","2021-04-20 16:38:52","","","","MAR","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: Frontiers Media S.

Its first dimension is auto-empathy and refers to an empathetic relationship with oneself: how can a human directing a robot expand the various components of empathy he feels for himself to this robot? The second is direct empathy: what does a human attribute to a robot in terms of thoughts, emotions, action potentials or even altruism, on the model of what he imagines and attributes to himself? The third dimension is reciprocal empathy that consists of thinking that a robot is able to identify with me, feel or guess my emotions and thoughts, anticipate my actions and wear me assistance if necessary. Finally, the fourth dimension, intersubjective empathy, is about thinking and imagining that a robot can inform me of things - emotions, thoughts that I am likely to experience- that I do not know about myself. Each of these four dimensions includes four different components: (1) Action (empathy of action), (2) Emotion (emotional empathy), (3) Cognition (cognitive empathy) and (4) Assistance (empathy of assistance).

What exactly is empathy, and why do most humans have it? We present a model which suggests that empathy is an emergent behavior with four main elements: a mirror neuron system, somatosensory cortices, an insula, and infant-directed “baby talk” or motherese. To test our hypothesis, we implemented a robot called MEI (multimodal emotional intelligence) with these functions, and allowed it to interact with human caregivers using comfort and approval motherese, the first kinds of vocalizations heard by infants at 3 and 6 months of age. The robot synchronized in real-time to the humans through voice and movement dynamics, while training statistical models associated with its low level gut feeling (“flourishing” or “distress”, based on battery or temperature). Experiments show that the post-interaction robot associates novel happy voices with physical flourishing 90 % of the time, sad voices with distress 84 % of the time. Our results also show that a robot trained with infant-directed “attention bids” can recognize adult fear voices. Importantly, this is the first emotion system to recognize adult emotional voices after training only with motherese, suggesting that this specific parental behavior may help build emotional intelligence. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","2015","2021-04-20 16:38:53","2021-04-20 16:38:53","","35-49","","1","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: Kluwer Academic Publishers","<p>cited By 16</p>","","","Agricultural robots; Developmental robotics; Educational robots; Emergent behaviors; Emotional intelligence; Emotional voices; Intelligent robots; Interaction robot; Mirror systems; Mirror-neuron system; Mirrors; Multi-modal; Social robots; Somatosensory cortex; Speech recognition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is because empathic interactions with ordinary people are needed to introduce robots into our society. Several attempts have been made for specific situations. However, such attempts have provided several limitations; thus, diminishing authenticity. The present article proposes “affective developmental robotics (hereafter, ADR),” which provides more authentic artificial empathy based on the concept of cognitive developmental robotics (hereafter, CDR). First, the evolution and development of empathy as revealed in neuroscience and biobehavioral studies are reviewed, moving from emotional contagion to envy and schadenfreude. These terms are then reconsidered from the ADR/CDR viewpoint, particularly along the developmental trajectory of self-other cognition. Next, a conceptual model of artificial empathy is proposed based on an ADR/CDR viewpoint and discussed with respect to several existing studies.

On the one hand, we performed this study to assess the quality of the current facial expressions of two robot heads. On the other hand, we aimed at developing a simple, easy-to-use methodological variation to evaluate facial expressions of robotic heads. Short movie clips of two different robot heads showing a happy, sad, surprised, and neutral facial expression were compiled into an online survey, to examine how people interpret these expressions. Additionally, we added a control condition with a human face showing the same four emotions. The results showed that the facial expressions could be recognized well for both heads. Even the blender emotion surprised was recognized, although it resulted in positive and negative connotations. These results underline the importance of the situational context to correctly interpret emotional facial expressions. Besides the expected finding that the human is perceived significantly more anthropomorphic and animate than both robot heads, the more human-like designed robot head was rated significantly higher with respect to anthropomorphism than the robot head using animal-like features. In terms of the validation procedure, we could provide evidence for a feasible two-step procedure. By assessing the participants’ dispositional empathy with a questionnaire it can be ensured that they are in general able to decode facial expressions into the corresponding emotion.

According to the famous model of the uncanny valley these opposite reactions depend on the degree of familiarity that different artifacts engender in humans. The aim of my work is trying to find out the cognitive bases of familiarity, analyzing the origin of anthropomorphic projection, namely human disposition to attribute anthropomorphic features - like intentions or feelings—to artifacts. I shall discuss two concepts: relatedness and empathy, and argue that relatedness is the precondition for empathy. The fact that it is possible to attribute anthropomorphic features virtually to any object shows that resemblance is not the point. Anthropomorphism is a kind of relation that humans establish with an artifact, and in order to comprehend this phenomenon we have to focus on the relational aspect. I shall argue that what we call anthropomorphism is an extension to nonhumans of forms of interactions typical of human communication, i.e. the attribution to an artifact of the position of interlocutor in a possible dialogue. It can be shown that attributing to an artifact the position of interlocutor in a dialogue implies dealing with it as if it were endowed of the features characterizing human mind, i.e. mental states and emotions. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","2015","2021-04-20 16:38:53","2021-04-20 16:38:53","","117-127","","1","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: Kluwer Academic Publishers","<p>cited By 24</p>","","","Agricultural robots; Anthropomorphism; Communication; Empathy; Human communications; Mechanical device; Mental state; Relatedness; Social robots; Theory of minds; Uncanny valley","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our results suggest that people may empathize more with a physical robot than a simulated one, a finding that has important implications on the generalizability and applicability of simulated HRI work.

Our work aims at recovering the lost contact with animals in the urban context, taking advantage of biophilic empathy. The parameters governing the robotised elements we propose are mainly qualitative (emotions and aesthetical perception), which cannot easily be described by mathematical parameters. Additionally, due to their complexity, it is often impossible –or at least impractical, to hardcode suitable controllers for such structures. Thus, we propose the use of Artificial Intelligence learning techniques, concretely Evolutionary Algorithms, to allow the user to teach the robotised components how to behave in response to their resemblance to specific animal behaviors.

Despite the production of different computational models, their integration with cognitive and psychological theories remains a central problem. Reasons are both methodological and theoretical. Primarily, it is difficult to quantify the impact of such factors as individual differences, inclinations and personality traits. In addition, Agent-Based Models (ABMs) often use linear dynamics, even in describing emotions, without considering the basis of psychophysics. Bearing in mind this and focusing on compassion as a particular emotion, the paper aims to present a “Decalogue” for those interested in designing agents capable of mimicking human emotional behaviors.

The robot's function is to increase people's awareness to the effect of their behavior towards others, potentially leading to behavior change. Specifically, Kip1 is designed to promote non-aggressive conversation between people. It monitors the conversation's nonverbal aspects and maintains an emotional model of its reaction to the conversation. If the conversation seems calm, Kip1 responds by a gesture designed to communicate curious interest. If the conversation seems aggressive, Kip1 responds by a gesture designed to communicate fear. We describe the design process of Kip1, guided by the principles of peripheral and evocative. We detail its hardware and software systems, and a study evaluating the effects of the robot's autonomous behavior on couples' conversations. We find support for our design goals. A conversation companion reacting to the conversation led to more gaze attention, but not more verbal distraction, compared to a robot that moves but does not react to the conversation. This suggests that robotic devices could be designed as companions to human-human interaction without compromising the natural communication flow between people. Participants also rated the reacting robot as having significantly more social human character traits and as being significantly more similar to them. This points to the robot's potential to elicit people's empathy. © 2015 ACM.","2015","2021-04-20 16:38:54","2021-04-20 16:38:54","","3-10","","","2015-March","","","","","","","","IEEE Computer Society","","English","","","","","","","ISSN: 21672148","<p>cited By 59; Conference of 10th Annual ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction, HRI 2015 ; Conference Date: 2 March 2015 Through 5 March 2015; Conference Code:114310</p>","","","ambient kinetic tangibles; Autonomous behaviors; Behavior change; Behavioral research; Design; Design and evaluations; empathy; Hardware and software; Human computer interaction; Human robot interaction; Human-human interactions; Machine design; Man machine systems; Natural communication; Robotics; Robots","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A group of participants is used to evaluate how imitation by a robot affects people’s perception of their conversation with it. A set of twelve questions about the participants’ university experience serves as a backbone for the dialogue structure. In our experimental evaluation, the robot reacts in one of three ways to the human upper body pose: ignoring it, displaying its own upper body pose, and mirroring it. The manner in which the robot behaviour influences human appraisal is analysed using the standard Godspeed questionnaire. Our results show that robot body mirroring/non-mirroring influences the perceived humanness of the robot. The results also indicate that body pose mirroring is an important factor in facilitating rapport and empathy in human social interactions with robots. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","2015","2021-04-20 16:38:54","2021-04-20 16:38:54","","214-223","","","9388 LNCS","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: Springer Verlag","<p>cited By 7; Conference of 7th International Conference on Social Robotics, ICSR 2015 ; Conference Date: 26 October 2015 Through 30 October 2015; Conference Code:154559</p>","","","Anthropomorphism; Behavioral research; Body pose; Empathy; Experimental evaluation; Human robot interaction; Human social interactions; Human upper body; Man machine systems; Rapport; Robotics; Robots; Upper bodies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We have collected a significant amount of subjective evaluation data from the public by performing a storytelling demonstration that enhanced people's empathy towards the robot. The evaluation model consists of the robot's human friendliness, which involves its impression on humans, interaction with humans, and imitation of human motions and the robot's human appearance which involves gender, age, height, and body type. This study shows that there is no significant difference in human-friendliness between gender groups (male and female), while there is a significant difference between age groups (children and adults).

Previous studies compared interfaces on the left side of the uncanny valley, namely, those with low human likeness. To examine interfaces with higher human realism, a between-groups factorial experiment was conducted through the internet with 426 midwestern U.S. undergraduates. This experiment presented a hypothetical ethical dilemma followed by the advice of an authority figure. The authority was manipulated in three ways: depiction (digitally recorded or computer animated), motion quality (smooth or jerky), and advice (disclose or refrain from disclosing sensitive information). Of these, only the advice changed opinion about the ethical dilemma, even though the animated depiction was significantly eerier than the human depiction.

The system relies on the learning by teaching paradigm to build an interaction, so as to stimulate meta-cognition, empathy and increased self-esteem in the child user. We hypothesise that use of a humanoid robot in such a system could not just engage an unmotivated student, but could also present the opportunity for children to experience physically-induced benefits encountered during human-led handwriting interventions, such as motor mimicry. By leveraging simulated handwriting on a synchronised tablet display, a NAO humanoid robot with limited fine motor capabilities has been configured as a suitably embodied handwriting partner. Statistical shape models derived from principal component analysis of a dataset of adult-written letter trajectories allow the robot to draw purposefully deformed letters. By incorporating feedback from user demonstrations, the system is then able to learn the optimal parameters for the appropriate shape models. Preliminary in situ studies have been conducted with primary school classes to obtain insight into children's use of the novel system. Children aged 6-8 successfully engaged with the robot and improved its writing to a level which they were satisfied with. The validation of the interaction represents a significant step towards an innovative use for robotics which addresses a widespread and socially meaningful challenge in education. © 2015 ACM.","2015","2021-04-20 16:38:54","2021-04-20 16:38:54","","83-90","","","2015-March","","","","","","","","IEEE Computer Society","","English","","","","","","","ISSN: 21672148","<p>cited By 82; Conference of 10th Annual ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction, HRI 2015 ; Conference Date: 2 March 2015 Through 5 March 2015; Conference Code:114310</p>","","","Anthropomorphic robots; Education; Education computing; Human robot interaction; Humanoid robot; In-Situ Study; Learning by teaching; Man machine systems; Meta cognitions; Optimal parameter; Primary schools; Principal component analysis; Robotic partners; Robotics; Robots; Statistical shape model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper presents the basis for a computational model tasked with computing patient shame and the empathetic response of a caregiver during “empathetic opportunities” in their interaction. A PD patient is liable to suffer indignity when there is a substantial difference between his experienced shame and the empathy shown by the caregiver. When this difference falls outside of acceptable set bounds (norms), the robotic agent will act using subtle, nonverbal cues to guide the relationship back within these bounds, preserving patient dignity. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","2015","2021-04-20 16:38:54","2021-04-20 16:38:54","","532-542","","","9388 LNCS","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: Springer Verlag","<p>cited By 3; Conference of 7th International Conference on Social Robotics, ICSR 2015 ; Conference Date: 26 October 2015 Through 30 October 2015; Conference Code:154559</p>","","","Computation theory; Computational methods; Computational model; Nonverbal channels; Nonverbal cues; Norm violation; Robotic agents; Robotics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Humans are hybrids individually: our brains are wired to adapt our evaluative approach to our circumstances. For example, stressors can inhibit the action of oxytocin in the brain, thus forcing a nurse who usually acts from subjective empathy to defer to objective rules instead. In contrast, ecosystem approaches to ethics promote hybridization across, rather than within, individuals; the nurse being empowered to specialize in personalized care because other workers specialize in standardization, and profitability. Various philosophers have argued, or laid the framework to argue, that such specialization can be advantageous to teams and societies. Rather than mass-produce identical machines to emulate the best individual human, perhaps we should build diverse teams of machines to emulate the best human teams. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015","2015","2021-04-20 16:38:54","2021-04-20 16:38:54","","111-127","","","74","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: Kluwer Academic Publishers","<p>cited By 3</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This smartness monitors, anticipates and supports our activities, increasing efficiency of our activities. Smartness is usually associated with efficiency, but it also allows environments, virtual humans and social robots to display emotions, empathy and provide environments to introduce and support humorous events. We review examples of playful and humorous street furniture in ‘playable’ cities and projects that allow residents and visitors to interact with objects and environments in playful and humorous ways. We add observations on humor theory, in particular observations that deal with physical, visual and multimodal humor. Our emphasis is on introducing incongruities and on exploring different forms of incongruities in order to introduce humorous situations. Inventories of incongruities are explored. These inventories have been obtained from observing humor in everyday situations, in comedies, in movies, and in TV commercials. Shortcomings of these inventories from the point of view of multimodal and interaction humor are discussed and some preliminary views on additional approaches are provided. © 2015 The Authors","2015","2021-04-20 16:38:54","2021-04-20 16:38:54","","2175-2182","","","3","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier B.V.","<p>cited By 6</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
