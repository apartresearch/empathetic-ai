But the fact that the term `empathy' has strong social connotations raises a question: can it be applied to robots? Can we actually use social terms and explanations in relation to these inanimate machines? In this article, I analyse the range of uses of the term empathy in the field of HRI studies and social robotics, and consider the substantial, functional and relational positions on this issue. I focus on the relational (cooperational) perspective presented by Luisa Damiano and Paul Dumouchel, who interpret emotions (together with empathy) as being the result of affective coordination. I also reflect on the criteria that should be used to determine when, in such relations, we are dealing with actual empathy.","","2021-04-19 15:55:59","2021-04-19 15:55:59","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article; Early Access","","","","","Empathy; Human&#8211; Neuroscience; robot interactions; Social robots","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Moreover, it is unclear whether all customers respond to the interaction with frontline service robots in the same way. Our research looks at how individual differences in social behaviors, specifically in customers' attachment styles, influence three types of customer responses: affective responses (experienced pleasantness), attitudinal responses (perceived empathy, satisfaction), and behavioral responses (word-of-mouth). Three experimental studies reveal that customers with low (vs. high) scores on anxious attachment style (AAS) measures respond more negatively to frontline service robot (compared to a frontline human agent). We investigate alternative explanations for these findings, such as robots' level of anthropomorphism and we show that human-likeness features such as voice type and level of human-like physical appearance, cannot explain our findings. Our results indicate that for low-AAS customers replacing frontline human service agent with frontline robot undermines customer attitude and behavioral responses to service robots, leading to possible implications on customer segmentation, targeting, and marketing communication.","","2021-04-19 15:55:59","2021-04-19 15:55:59","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article; Early Access","","","","","anthropomorphism; attachment styles; empathy; service robots; social response","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One such approach involves asking participants to inflict `harm' on a robot. Researchers are interested in the length of time between the experimenter issuing the instruction and the participant complying, and propose that relatively long periods of hesitation might reflect empathy for the robot, and perhaps even attribution of human-like qualities, such as agency and sentience. In a recent experiment, we adapted the so-called `hesitance to hit' paradigm, in which participants were instructed to hit a humanoid robot on the head with a mallet. After standing up to do so (signaling intent to hit the robot), participants were stopped, and then took part in a semi-structured interview to probe their thoughts and feelings during the period of hesitation. Thematic analysis of the responses indicate that hesitation not only reflects perceived socialness, but also other factors including (but not limited to) concerns about cost, mallet disbelief, processing of the task instruction, and the influence of authority. The open-ended, free responses participants provided also offer rich insights into individual differences with regards to anthropomorphism, perceived power imbalances, and feelings of connection toward the robot. In addition to aiding understanding of this measurement technique and related topics regarding socialness attribution to robots, we argue that greater use of open questions can lead to exciting new research questions and interdisciplinary collaborations in the domain of social robotics.","2021-02-25","2021-04-19 15:56:00","2021-04-19 15:56:00","","","","","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND Publisher: FRONTIERS MEDIA SA Type: Article","","","","","empathy; human- robot interaction; prosocial behaviour; qualitative research; social perception; social robotics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, progress is not always followed by ethical reflection on its consequences or scientists' responsibility for their creations. The humanities can help health sciences students learn to critically analyse these issues; in particular, literature can aid discussions about ethical principles in biomedical research. Mary Shelley's Frankenstein; or, the modern Prometheus (1818) is an example of a classic novel presenting complex scenarios that could be used to stimulate discussion. Main text Within the framework of the 200th anniversary of the novel, we searched PubMed to identify works that explore and discuss its value in teaching health sciences. Our search yielded 56 articles, but only two of these reported empirical findings. Our analysis of these articles identified three main approaches to using Frankenstein in teaching health sciences: discussing the relationship between literature and science, analysing ethical issues in biomedical research, and examining the importance of empathy and compassion in healthcare and research. After a critical discussion of the articles, we propose using Frankenstein as a teaching tool to prompt students to critically analyse ethical aspects of scientific and technological progress, the need for compassion and empathy in medical research, and scientists' responsibility for their discoveries. Conclusion Frankenstein can help students reflect on the personal and social limits of science, the connection between curiosity and scientific progress, and scientists' responsibilities. Its potential usefulness in teaching derives from the interconnectedness of science, ethics, and compassion. Frankenstein can be a useful tool for analysing bioethical issues related to scientific and technological advances, such as artificial intelligence, genetic engineering, and cloning. Empirical studies measuring learning outcomes are necessary to confirm the usefulness of this approach.","2021-02-23","2021-04-19 15:56:00","2021-04-19 15:56:00","","","","1","22","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND Publisher: BMC Type: Article","","","","","Bioethics; Frankenstein; Health sciences; responsibility; Science fiction; Scientists&#8217; Teaching","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

What our global society needs is a multilingual and transcultural approach to decode-encode the treasure of human experience and transmit it to the next generation of world citizens.

Goal conflicts can arise from simple trajectory planning to complex task prioritization. For successful human-robot goal-conflict resolution, humans and robots need to negotiate their goals and priorities. For this, the robot might be equipped with effective conflict resolution strategies to be assertive and effective but similarly accepted by the user. In this paper, conflict resolution strategies for service robots (public cleaning robot, home assistant robot) are developed by transferring psychological concepts (e.g., negotiation, cooperation) to HRI. Altogether, fifteen strategies were grouped by the expected affective outcome (positive, neutral, negative). In two online experiments, the acceptability of and compliance with these conflict resolution strategies were tested with humanoid and mechanic robots in two application contexts (public: n(1) = 61; private: n(2) = 93). To obtain a comparative value, the strategies were also applied by a human. As additional outcomes trust, fear, arousal, and valence, as well as perceived politeness of the agent were assessed. The positive/neutral strategies were found to be more acceptable and effective than negative strategies. Some negative strategies (i.e., threat, command) even led to reactance and fear. Some strategies were only positively evaluated and effective for certain agents (human or robot) or only acceptable in one of the two application contexts (i.e., approach, empathy). Influences on strategy acceptance and compliance in the public context could be found: acceptance was predicted by politeness and trust. Compliance was predicted by interpersonal power. Taken together, psychological conflict resolution strategies can be applied in HRI to enhance robot task effectiveness. If applied robot-specifically and context-sensitively they are accepted by the user. The contribution of this paper is twofold: conflict resolution strategies based on Human Factors and Social Psychology are introduced and empirically evaluated in two online studies for two application contexts. Influencing factors and requirements for the acceptance and effectiveness of robot assertiveness are discussed.","2021-01-26","2021-04-19 15:56:00","2021-04-19 15:56:00","","","","","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND Publisher: FRONTIERS MEDIA SA Type: Article","","","","","acceptance; HRI strategies; persuasive robots; robot assertiveness; trust; user compliance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Machine learning (ML), on the other hand, can analyse huge amount of data to discover useful trends and patterns in shortest time possible. Despite the benefits, ML usage in EI training is scarce. In this paper, we studied 92 journal articles to discover the trend of the ML utilisation in the study of EI and its components. This survey aims to pave way for future studies that could lead to implementation of ML in EI training, and to rope in researchers in psychology and computer science to find possibilities of having a generic ML algorithm for every EI's components. Our findings show an increasing trend to apply ML on EI components, and Support Vector Machine and Neural Network are the two most popular ML algorithms used in those researches. We also found that social skill and empathy are the least exposed EI components to ML. Finally, we provide recommendations for future research direction of ML in EI domain, and EI in ML.","","2021-04-19 15:56:00","2021-04-19 15:56:00","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND Publisher: TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD Type: Article; Early Access","","","","","emotional intelligence; Machine learning; Neural Network; Support Vector Machine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous neuroimaging studies have indicated that neural responses of empathy for others' pain are modulated by an early automatic emotional sharing and a late controlled cognitive evaluation process. Recent studies about pain empathy for robots found humans present similar empathy process towards humanoid robots under painful stimuli as well as to humans. However, the whole-brain functional connectivity and the spatial dynamics of neural activities underlying empathic processes are still unknown. In the present study, the functional connectivity was investigated for ERPs recorded from 18 healthy adults who were presented with pictures of human hand and robot hand under painful and non-painful situations. Functional brain networks for both early and late empathy responses were constructed and a new parameter, empathy index (EI), was proposed to represent the empathy ability of humans quantitatively. We found that the mutual dependences between early ERP components was significantly decreased, but for the late components, there were no significant changes. The mutual dependences for human hand stimuli were larger than to robot hand stimuli for early components, but not for late components. The connectivity weights for early components were larger than late components. EI value shows significant difference between painful and non-painful stimuli, indicating it is a good indicator to represent the empathy of humans. This study enriches our understanding of the neurological mechanisms implicated in human empathy, and provides evidence of functional connectivity for both early and late responses of pain empathy towards humans and robots.","2021-01-22","2021-04-19 15:56:00","2021-04-19 15:56:00","","","","","151","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND Publisher: PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD Type: Article","","","","","EEG; Empathy; Empathy index; Functional connectivity; Human-robot interaction; Mutual information","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In social neuroscience, many experiments have sought to first define and then locate `perspective taking', `empathy', and other psychological concepts to specific brain circuits. Seldom, bottom-up studies were conducted to first identify explanatory patterns of brain variation, which are then related to psychological concepts; perhaps due to a lack of large population datasets. In this spirit, we performed a systematic de-construction of social brain morphology into its elementary building blocks, involving similar to 10,000 UK Biobank participants. We explored coherent representations of structural co-variation at population scale within a recent social brain atlas, by translating autoencoder neural networks from deep learning. The learned subnetworks revealed essential patterns of structural relationships between social brain regions, with the nucleus accumbens, medial prefrontal cortex, and temporoparietal junction embedded at the core. Some of the uncovered subnetworks contributed to predicting examined social traits in general, while other subnetworks helped predict specific facets of social functioning, such as the experience of social isolation. As a consequence of our population-level evidence, spatially overlapping subsystems of the social brain probably relate to interindividual differences in everyday social life. Kiesow et al. use deep learning to identify partially overlapping subnetworks in the human social brain at the population level. They also demonstrate that the learned subnetwork representations can be used to predict social traits.","2021-01-14","2021-04-19 15:56:01","2021-04-19 15:56:01","","","","1","4","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY Publisher: NATURE RESEARCH Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Collectively, these have resulted in the modification of the physician's role as the gatekeeper for health care, increased shift-based care, and amplified interprofessional team-based care. Technological innovations present opportunities as well as challenges. Artificial intelligence, which has great potential, has already transformed some tasks, particularly those involving image interpretation. Ubiquitous access to information via the Internet by physicians and patients alike presents benefits as well as drawbacks: patients and providers have ready access to virtually all of human knowledge, but some websites are contaminated with misinformation and many people have difficulty differentiating between solid, evidence-based data and untruths. The role of the future physician will shift as complexity in health care increases and as artificial intelligence and other technologies advance. These technological advances demand new skills of physicians; memory and knowledge accumulation will diminish in importance while information management skills will become more important. In parallel, medical educators must enhance their teaching and assessment of critical human skills (e.g., clear communication, empathy) in the delivery of patient care. The authors emphasize the enduring role of critical human skills in safe and effective patient care even as medical practice is increasingly guided by artificial intelligence and related technology, and they suggest new and longitudinal ways of assessing essential noncognitive skills to meet the demands of the future. The authors envision practical and achievable benefits accruing to patients and providers if practitioners leverage technological advancements to facilitate the development of their critical human skills.","2021-01","2021-04-19 15:56:01","2021-04-19 15:56:01","","37-43","","1","96","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA Publisher: LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Prosocial games are games focusing on helping others. Game researchers have been keen to investigate factors that influence the immersive experience in digital games. Previous studies show that VR allows people to take the perspective of others, inducing empathy and prosocial behaviour in the real world. In this lab-based study, we explore whether and how taking the perspective of other game characters - NPCs in a prosocial VR game - influences players' in-game empathy towards NPCs and game immersion. Participants first experienced either a robot's perspective of being destroyed by fire in VR or read a text description about the same event. Then, they participated a prosocial VR game in which they saved robots. The findings show that perspective-taking experiences indirectly enhance participants' game immersion via the effects of closeness with the destroyed robot and empathy towards the four robots protected by the player. This indirect effect is moderated by players' weekly exposure to video games. These results suggest that VR-based perspective-taking of NPCs can indirectly enhance gameplay experiences in prosocial VR games. Theoretical and game design implications are discussed.","","2021-04-19 15:56:01","2021-04-19 15:56:01","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND Publisher: TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD Type: Article; Early Access","","","","","digital games; empathy; Perspective taking; prosocial games; virtual reality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Fair Play is an avatar-based role-playing video game in which Jamal Davis, a Black graduate student at a research university, navigates implicit forms of racial bias to reach the win-state of earning his PhD and becoming a professor. Fair Play was designed to educate players on the existence of racial bias in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine (STEMM) fields in an experiential way and to encourage perspective-taking. Research has found that taking the perspective of another can induce empathy, which improves the empathizer's attitudes towards individuals and groups. Paired with a facilitated workshop, Fair Play was also designed to teach bias concepts to increase participants' bias literacy. Intervention. Research on workshops to reduce gender bias suggests that it increased awareness of personal bias, the motivation and self-efficacy to practice bias-reducing strategies, and a more welcoming department climate and the hiring of more women faculty three years after the intervention. Capitalizing on these findings, a 3-hour workshop was developed to reduce race-based bias against Black/African Americans in STEMM using Fair Play. Conclusions. The facilitation of the workshops and Fair Play requires particular competencies due to its topic (racial bias) and player's skepticism about the reality of the bias incidents. Our data suggest that participants who identify as a person of color are more likely to believe that bias exists compared to White players, which can lead to a discussion about how the incidents in the game were designed and scripted. The facilitator also needs to be versed in a number of intentional design choices, such as Jamal not having voiceover and his success. Finally, this paper describes the Facilitator Game, which was developed as a complement to the game and allows a facilitator to jump to bias incidents quickly while debriefing and discussing the game to further participant learning.","","2021-04-19 15:56:01","2021-04-19 15:56:01","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 2455 ℡LER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA Publisher: SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC Type: Article; Early Access","","","","","games for learning; professional development; Serious games; social impact game","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In human social interaction, the facial expression serves important communicative functions. We examined whether a robot's face is similarly important in human-robot communication. Based on emotion research and neuropsychological insights on the parallel processing of emotions, we argue that greater plasticity in the robot's face elicits higher affective responsivity, more closely resembling human-to-human responsiveness than a more static face. We conducted a between-subjects experiment of 3 (facial plasticity: human vs. facially flexible robot vs. facially static robot) x 2 (treatment: affectionate vs. maltreated). Participants (N = 265; M-age = 31.5) were measured for their emotional responsiveness, empathy, and attribution of feelings to the robot. Results showed empathically and emotionally less intensive responsivity toward the robots than toward the human but followed similar patterns. Significantly different intensities of feelings and attributions (e.g., pain upon maltreatment) followed facial articulacy. Theoretical implications for underlying processes in human-robot communication are discussed. We theorize that precedence of emotion and affect over cognitive reflection, which are processed in parallel, triggers the experience of `because I feel, I believe it's real,' despite being aware of communicating with a robot. By evoking emotional responsiveness, the cognitive awareness of `it is just a robot' fades into the background and appears not relevant anymore.","2020-12","2021-04-19 15:56:02","2021-04-19 15:56:02","","","","4","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND Publisher: MDPI Type: Article","","","","","empathy; experiment; facial expression; human-robot communication; social robots; user response","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Evidence indicates that OT effects on human behavior are multifaceted, such as trust behavior, decrease anxiety, empathy and bonding behavior. For the vital role of mentalizing in understanding others, here we examine whether OT has a general effect on mentalizing brain network which is associated to the effect of related social behavioral and personality traits. Using a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled group design, we investigate the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging after intranasal OT or placebo. The functional connectivity (FC) maps with seed in left/right temporoparietal junction (lTPJ/rTPJ) showed that OT significantly increased connectivity between rTPJ and default attention network (DAN), but decreased the FC between lTPJ and medial prefrontal network (MPN). With machine learning approach, we report that identified altered FCs of TPJ can classify OT and placebo (PL) group. Moreover, individual's empathy trait can modulate the FC between left TPJ and right rectus (RECT), which shows a positive correlation with empathic concern in PL group but a negative correlation in OT group. These results demonstrate that OT has significant effect on FC with lTPJ and rTPJ, brain regions where are critical for mentalizing, and the empathy concern can modulate the FC. These findings advance our understanding of the neural mechanisms by which OT modulates social behaviors, especially in social interaction involving mentalizing.","2020-12","2021-04-19 15:56:02","2021-04-19 15:56:02","","2530-2541","","6","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article","","","","","fMRI; Functional connectivity; Mentalizing network; Oxytocin; Temporoparietal junction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ian McEwan's Machines like Me","CRITIQUE-STUDIES IN CONTEMPORARY FICTION","","0011-1619","10.1080/00111619.2020.1851165","","McEwan's novel Machines Like Me was met with lukewarm reviews and open hostility of the sci-fi genre adherents. It seemed to have appropriated some of the key issues of the genre discourse - the question of what constitutes humanity, of the possibility of coexistence between humans and AI, of the problems of morality and consent. It also made use of time-honored devices of alternative history without treating it too seriously. Instead, the characters are enmeshed in personal problems and conundrums of science and politics, justice and empathy - and love. McEwan's commentary on the novel in various interviews only aggravated the critics who were all too ready to conclude that Machines Like Me offered little originality. This essay will demonstrate that the text is carefully layered as if to protect its own novelty hidden beneath rather conventional love triangle plot, ponderous political commentary, and genre-specific topicality. It will be an effort to understand the complex relation between the writer and conventions which come into play in his novel, and it will proceed to read the text against the authorial comments, finding suppressed hints that invite an interpretation of the text as narrated by its android hero rather than human subject.","","2021-04-19 15:56:02","2021-04-19 15:56:02","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND Publisher: ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD Type: Article; Early Access","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nowadays, technological breakthroughs might have a significant impact on our moral character and abilities. This is the case of Virtual Reality (VR) technologies. The aim of this paper is to consider the ethical aspects of the use of VR in enhancing empathy. First, we will offer an introduction to VR, explaining its fundamental features, devices and concepts. Then, we will approach the characterization of VR as an “empathy machine,” showing why this medium has aroused so much interest and why, nevertheless, we do not believe it is the ideal way to enhance empathy. As an alternative, we will consider fostering empathy-related abilities through virtual embodiment in avatars. In the conclusion, however, we will examine some of the serious concerns related to the ethical relevance of empathy and will defend the philosophical case for a reason-guided empathy, also suggesting specific guidelines for possible future developments of empathy enhancement projects through VR embodied experiences.","2020-11-09","2021-04-19 15:56:02","2021-04-19 15:56:02","","","","","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND Publisher: FRONTIERS MEDIA SA Type: Article","","","","","applied ethics; empathy; empathy enhancement; moral enhancement; moral psychology; neuroethics; virtual embodiment; virtual reality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A plethora of warfighting games exist commercially, but there is a lack of digital games that deal with peace processes. Furthermore, none simulate actual peacekeeping. The United Nations currently deploys about 100,000 peacekeepers to some of the world's most dangerous zones, where peacekeepers save lives, alleviate suffering, and help create conditions for peace. The United Nations and national militaries lack peacekeeping simulations to help train their soldiers. Additionally, the public needs to learn more about the way peacekeeping works. Thus, peacekeeping simulation and gaming are worth exploring, especially in the rapidly evolving digital space, which offers new avenues and benefits. Methods. We review the meager literature on the subject and observe that there are few digital games to directly draw from. We build on previous work that argued the need for such development, but we now assess important design principles and parameters. We draw upon peacekeeping tabletop exercises that are already well developed. Results. We conclude that excellent scenarios and simulation technologies exist that could be combined quite easily for effective peacekeeping training and public education. We find key materials and scenarios in exercises of the United Nations and of the Pearson Peacekeeping Centre. Highlighted areas for future digital design are the inclusion of non-military avatars, emphasis on soft skills development (especially empathy), and realistically complex links between actions and consequences. Conclusion. While describing some UN exploration at a proof-of-concept stage, we suggest that both the United Nations and the gaming industry should explore the idea further to achieve synergies between institutional and entertainment applications. The growing capacity of digital technology allows significant innovation, yielding results that could be useful, ethical, enjoyable, and potentially profitable.","2021-04","2021-04-19 15:56:03","2021-04-19 15:56:03","","226-242","","2","52","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 2455 ℡LER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA Publisher: SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC Type: Article","","","","","digital games; empathy; peace operations; peace simulation; peacekeeping; stability operations; training < objective; United Nations; virtual gaming","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Materials and Methods: Co-design workshops with general practitioners were conducted. The workshops focused on (1) understanding the current consultation context and identifying existing problems, (2) ideating future solutions to these problems, and (3) discussing future roles for Al in primary care. The workshop activities included affinity diagramming, brainwriting, and video prototyping methods. The workshops were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Inductive thematic analysis of the transcripts of conversations was performed. Results: Two researchers facilitated 3 co-design workshops with 16 general practitioners. Three main themes emerged: professional autonomy, human-AI collaboration, and new models of care. Major implications identified within these themes included (1) concerns with medico-legal aspects arising from constant recording and accessibility of full consultation records, (2) future consultations taking place out of the exam rooms in a distributed system involving empowered patients, (3) human conversation and empathy remaining the core tasks of doctors in any future AI-enabled consultations, and (4) questioning the current focus of AI initiatives on improved efficiency as opposed to patient care. Conclusions: AI documentation assistants will likely to be integral to the future primary care consultations. However, these technologies will still need to be supervised by a human until strong evidence for reliable autonomous performance is available. Therefore, different human-AI collaboration models will need to be designed and evaluated to ensure patient safety, quality of care, doctor safety, and doctor autonomy.","2020-11","2021-04-19 15:56:03","2021-04-19 15:56:03","","1695-1704","","11","27","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND Publisher: OXFORD UNIV PRESS Type: Article","","","","","artificial intelligence; general practitioners; medical informatics; primary health care; qualitative study","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This article proposes a novel Automatic Cognitive Empathy Model, ACEM, for humanoid robots to achieve longer and more engaged human-robot interactions (HRI) by considering humans' emotions and replying to them appropriately. The proposed model continuously detects the affective states of a user based on facial expressions and generates desired, either parallel or reactive, empathic behaviors that are already adapted to the user's personality. Users' affective states are detected using a stacked autoencoder network that is trained and tested on the RAVDESS dataset. The overall proposed empathic model is verified throughout an experiment, where different emotions are triggered in participants and then empathic behaviors are applied based on proposed hypothesis. The results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed model in terms of related social and friendship concepts that participants perceived during interaction with the robot.","2020-11","2021-04-19 15:56:03","2021-04-19 15:56:03","","","","3, SI","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 2 PENN PLAZA, STE 701, NEW YORK, NY 10121-0701 USA Publisher: ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY Type: Article","","","","","adaptive interaction; Empathy; facial emotion detection; human robot interaction; non-verbal behavior; social robots","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we tested the effects of some socio-cognitive variables that could contribute to enhancing or reducing the implicit racial bias. The first aim of the study was to assess the beneficial effects of cooperation within a VR scenario, the second aim was to provide preliminary testing of the hypothesis that empathy and political attitudes could contribute to implicit bias about race, while the third aim was to explore the relationship between political attitudes and empathy. We had (Caucasian) participants embodied in a Black virtual body and engaged either in a cooperative (Coop group) or in a non-cooperative (Neutral group) activity with a confederate experimenter embodying another Black avatar. Before and after VR, we measured participants' implicit racial bias by means of Implicit Association Test (IAT) and their perceived closeness toward the confederate experimenter. Before VR we also assessed participants' political attitudes and empathy traits. Results revealed that, as compared to the Neutral group, the Coop group showed lower IAT scores after the social interaction. Interestingly, in the Neutral but not the Coop group the perceived closeness toward the confederate experimenter was associated with the initial racial bias: the more the participants reduced their distance, the more they reduced their IAT score. Moreover, reported traits of empathy and political attitudes significantly explained the variance observed in the initial implicit bias, with perspective-taking, empathic concern, and personal distress being significant predictors of the IAT scores. Finally, there was a relationship between political attitudes and empathy: the more participants considered themselves as left-wing voters, the higher their perspective-taking and empathic concern scores. We discuss these findings within the neuroscientific and social cognition field and encourage scholars from different domains to further explore whether and under which conditions a given manipulation for reducing racial bias could be efficiently transposed in VR.","2020-10-28","2021-04-19 15:56:03","2021-04-19 15:56:03","","","","","11","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND Publisher: FRONTIERS MEDIA SA Type: Article","","","","","cooperation; embodiment; empathy; implicit association test; implicit racial bias; inclusion of the other in the self; political attitudes; virtual reality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Robotic interventions have been explored for use with ASD children worldwide revealing that robots encourage one-to-one social and emotional interactions. However, associations between interpersonal synchronisation and emotional empathy have not yet been directly explored in French and Japanese ASD children when they interact with a human or a robot under analogous experimental conditions. Using the paradigm of actor-perceiver, where the child was the actor and the robot or the human the perceiver, we recorded the autonomic heart rate activation and reported emotional feelings of ASD children in both countries. Japanese and French ASD children showed different interpersonal synchronisation when they interacted with the human perceiver, even though the human was the same in both countries. However, they exhibited similar interpersonal synchronisation when the perceiver was the robot. The findings suggest that the mechanism combining interpersonal synchronisation and emotional empathy might be weakened but not absent in ASD children and that both French and Japanese ASD children do spontaneously and unconsciously discern non verbal actions of non human partners through a direct matching process that occurs via automatic mapping.","2020-10-15","2021-04-19 15:56:04","2021-04-19 15:56:04","","","","1","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY Publisher: NATURE RESEARCH Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Objective This study aimed to explore psychiatrists' opinions about the potential impact innovations in artificial intelligence and machine learning on psychiatric practice Methods In Spring 2019, we conducted a web-based survey of 791 psychiatrists from 22 countries worldwide. The survey measured opinions about the likelihood future technology would fully replace physicians in performing ten key psychiatric tasks. This study involved qualitative descriptive analysis of written responses (”comments”) to three open-ended questions in the survey. Results Comments were classified into four major categories in relation to the impact of future technology on: (1) patient-psychiatrist interactions; (2) the quality of patient medical care; (3) the profession of psychiatry; and (4) health systems. Overwhelmingly, psychiatrists were skeptical that technology could replace human empathy. Many predicted that `man and machine' would increasingly collaborate in undertaking clinical decisions, with mixed opinions about the benefits and harms of such an arrangement. Participants were optimistic that technology might improve efficiencies and access to care, and reduce costs. Ethical and regulatory considerations received limited attention. Conclusions This study presents timely information on psychiatrists' views about the scope of artificial intelligence and machine learning on psychiatric practice. Psychiatrists expressed divergent views about the value and impact of future technology with worrying omissions about practice guidelines, and ethical and regulatory issues.","2020-10","2021-04-19 15:56:04","2021-04-19 15:56:04","","","","","6","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND Publisher: SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD Type: Article","","","","","Artificial intelligence; attitudes; future; machine learning; mental health; opinions; psychiatry; qualitative research; technology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hundreds of genetic variants are expected to influence its complex development, but few have been identified. We used a machine learning method for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to uncover complex genotypic-phenotypic networks and environmental interactions. The Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) measured the self-regulatory components of personality critical for health (i.e., the character traits of self-directedness, cooperativeness, and self-transcendence). In a discovery sample of 2149 healthy Finns, we identified sets of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that cluster within particular individuals (i.e., SNP sets) regardless of phenotype. Second, we identified five clusters of people with distinct profiles of character traits regardless of genotype. Third, we found 42 SNP sets that identified 727 gene loci and were significantly associated with one or more of the character profiles. Each character profile was related to different SNP sets with distinct molecular processes and neuronal functions. Environmental influences measured in childhood and adulthood had small but significant effects. We confirmed the replicability of 95% of the 42 SNP sets in healthy Korean and German samples, as well as their associations with character. The identified SNPs explained nearly all the heritability expected for character in each sample (50 to 58%). We conclude that self-regulatory personality traits are strongly influenced by organized interactions among more than 700 genes despite variable cultures and environments. These gene sets modulate specific molecular processes in brain for intentional goal-setting, self-reflection, empathy, and episodic learning and memory.","2020-10","2021-04-19 15:56:04","2021-04-19 15:56:04","","2295-2312","","10","25","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND Publisher: SPRINGERNATURE Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, appropriate human-like empathic behaviors cannot be defined in advance, instead, they must be learned through daily interaction with humans in different situations. Additionally, to learn and apply the correct behaviors, robots must be able to perceive and understand the affective states of humans. This study presents a framework to enable cognitive empathy in social robots, which uses facial emotion recognition to perceive and understand the affective states of human users. The perceived affective state is then provided to a reinforcement learning model to enable a robot to learn the most appropriate empathic behaviors for different states. The proposed framework has been evaluated through an experiment between 28 individual humans and the humanoid robot Pepper. The results show that by applying empathic behaviors selected by the employed learning model, the robot is able to provide participants comfort and confidence and help them enjoy and feel better.","","2021-04-19 15:56:05","2021-04-19 15:56:05","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article; Early Access","","","","","Empathy; Human-robot interaction; Personality; Reinforcement learning; Social robot","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

When this dyad is completed, mind attribution towards intentionally harmed liminal minds is enhanced. However, from a dehumanisation view, malevolent actions may instead result in a denial of humanness. To contrast both accounts, a visual vignette experiment (N = 253) depicted either malevolent or benevolent intentions towards robotic or human avatars. Additionally, we examined the role of harm-salience by showing patients as either harmed, or still unharmed. The results revealed significantly increased mind attribution towards visibly harmed patients, mediated by perceived pain and expressed empathy. Benevolent and malevolent intentions were evaluated respectively as morally right or wrong, but their impact on the patient was diminished for the robotic avatar. Contrary to dehumanisation predictions, our manipulation of intentions failed to affect mind perception. Nonetheless, benevolent intentions reduced dehumanisation of the patients. Moreover, when pain and empathy were statistically controlled, the effect of intentions on mind perception was mediated by dehumanisation. These findings suggest that perceived intentions might only be indirectly tied to mind perception, and that their role may be better understood when additionally accounting for empathy and dehumanisation.","","2021-04-19 15:56:05","2021-04-19 15:56:05","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: THE ATRIUM, SOUTHERN GATE, CHICHESTER PO19 8SQ, W SUSSEX, ENGLAND Publisher: JOHN WILEY & SONS LTD Type: Article; Early Access","","","","","Benevolent intentions; Dehumanisation; Mind perception; Moral typecasting theory; Robots","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, the aim is to find out if social robots with empathetic voice are acceptable for users in healthcare applications. A pilot study using an empathetic voice spoken by a voice actor was conducted. Only prosody in speech is used to express empathy here, without any visual cues. Also, the emotions needed for an empathetic voice are identified. It was found that the emotions needed are not only the stronger primary emotions, but also the nuanced secondary emotions. These emotions are then synthesised using prosody modelling. A second study, replicating the pilot test is conducted using the synthesised voices to investigate if empathy is perceived from the synthetic voice as well. This paper reports the modelling and synthesises of an empathetic voice, and experimentally shows that people prefer empathetic voice for healthcare robots. The results can be further used to develop empathetic social robots, that can improve people's acceptance of social robots.","","2021-04-19 15:56:05","2021-04-19 15:56:05","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article; Early Access","","","","","Artificial empathy; Emotional speech synthesis; Healthcare; Prosody modelling; Social robots","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Users, on a restaurant guide site, utilize IDs to post their recommendation articles on restaurants, and these posted articles are a valuable information source for other users. Open users can search for restaurants and read recommendation articles posted by other users. Furthermore, they can react (e.g., “like”) to a recommendation article when they feel it is helpful or they feel like visiting the restaurant. On a target restaurant guide site, each post includes the user ID, restaurant name, recommendation sentences, etc., and the number of reactions is considered to depend on these posted contents. For users who post recommendation articles, the number of reactions to their posts represents the degree of empathy from other users and is an important motivation for posting. Therefore, posting users will benefit from guidelines on how to write good recommendation sentences to increase the number of reactions. Moreover, the number of reactions can be regarded as an important indicator of the activity level of the restaurant guide site from the viewpoint of the service operating company. Therefore, an analytical model developed using historical information such as posts and reactions by users would be useful for determining the relationship between posted contents and the number of reactions. Therefore, this paper proposes a model based on the machine learning approach to analyze the relation between the number of reactions and posted contents.

This study explores the service quality provided by robots based on real data in a hotel setting. A sample of 201 guests provided their expected service quality by robots and the actual performance experience after the service.

However, studies investigating social cognition, such as empathy and its underlying neural basis, are lacking. To explore the neural interactions among reward and memory circuits, we applied effective connectivity analysis on resting-state fMRI data collected from cocaine-dependent subjects. The relationship between effective connectivity within these two important circuits and empathy ability - evaluated with the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) - was assessed by machine learning algorithm using multivariate regression analysis. In accordance with the neurocircuitry disruptions of cocaine addiction, the results showed that cocaine-dependent subjects relative to healthy controls had altered resting state effective connectivity between parts of the memory and reward systems. Furthermore, effective connectivity between the memory and reward system could predict the fantasy empathy (FE) subscale scores in cocaine dependence. Overall, our findings provide further evidence for the neural substrates of social cognition in cocaine-dependent patients. These new insights could be useful for the development of new treatment programs for this substance dependency disorder.","","2021-04-19 15:56:06","2021-04-19 15:56:06","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article; Early Access","","","","","cocaine dependence; effective connectivity; fantasy empathy; social cognition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, a proper integration of IHRs requires a detailed description and explanation of their essential capabilities, particularly regarding their competencies in replicating and portraying emotive functions such as empathy. Existing humanoid robots can exhibit rudimentary forms of empathy; as these machines slowly become commonplace in healthcare settings, they will be expected to express empathy as a natural function, rather than merely to portray artificial empathy as a replication of human empathy. This article works with a twofold purpose: firstly, to consider the impact of artificial empathy in nursing and, secondly, to describe the influence of Affective Developmental Robotics (ADR) in anticipation of the empathic behaviour presented by artificial humanoid robots. The ADR has demonstrated that it can be one means by which humanoid nurse robots can achieve expressions of more relatable artificial empathy. This will be one of the vital models for intelligent humanoid robots currently in nurse robot development for the healthcare industry. A discussion of IHRs demonstrating artificial empathy is critical to nursing practice today, particularly in healthcare settings dense with technology.","2020-10","2021-04-19 15:56:06","2021-04-19 15:56:06","","","","4","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article","","","","","affective developmental robotics; artificial empathy; artificial intelligence; humanoid nurse robots; intelligent humanoid robots; nursing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Some researchers have argued that AI will augment the capacities of physicians and increase their availability to provide empathy and other uniquely human forms of care to their patients. The human vulnerabilities experienced in the healthcare context raise the stakes of new technologies such as AI, and the human dimensions of AI in healthcare have particular significance for research in the humanities. This article explains four key areas of concern relating to AI and the role that medical/health humanities research can play in addressing them: definition and regulation of “medical” versus “health” data and apps; social determinants of health; narrative medicine; and technological mediation of care. Issues include data privacy and trust, flawed datasets and algorithmic bias, racial discrimination, and the rhetoric of humanism and disability. Through a discussion of potential humanities contributions to these emerging intersections with AI, this article will suggest future scholarly directions for the field.","","2021-04-19 15:56:07","2021-04-19 15:56:07","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article; Early Access","","","","","Big data; Digital health; Health technology; Narrative medicine; Natural language processing; Social determinants of health","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Dick'sDo androids dream of electric sheep?","NEOHELICON","","0324-4652","10.1007/s11059-020-00544-z","","The official definition for alexithymia dates back to 1973, when Sifneos described its symptoms. Persons affected by this condition are unable to verbally describe their feelings. For many years this condition was relatively little known, but nowadays people are talking about it more and more. In forums in which the patients' comments are posted, it is often underscored how this particular mental state is similar to that of the androids described in the novelDo androids dream of electric sheep? by Philip K. Dick. The Dickian clinical references were those in use during the 1960s. Therefore, to special characteristics that Philip Dick attributed to his robots (coldness and lack of human empathy, and simultaneous desire for social acceptance), the writer, and then the critics, assigned the label of schizophrenia, the only one that the psychiatric manuals of that time associated to such symptoms. Today, if Dick were alive and were to write about his androids, he most likely would no longer use the term schizophrenics, but instead the term alexithymics, which are more socially adaptive than schizophrenics, just like his androids. Making retrospective diagnoses of literary characters is anachronistic; as it was done for decades by critics to consider the Dickian androids schizophrenics: in the fiction story they are not schizophrenics but robots. However a new psychological trait such as alexithymia can revisit that same story by giving it a new symbolic meaning. The aims of this article are: to highlight how the old nosological categories of schizophrenia, generally referred to when commentingDo androids dream of electric sheep?, should be supplemented by the category of alexithymia; to analyze the scenes in which the characters have typical alexithymic behaviors, trying to prove that alexithymia is actually best suited for describing the androids invented by Dick.","2020-12","2021-04-19 15:56:07","2021-04-19 15:56:07","","673-683","","2, SI","47","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article","","","","","Affective disorders; Alexithymia; Dick; Do androids dream of electric sheep?; Philip K; Schizophrenia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To fully exploit the application of a social robot as a psychometric tool, it is necessary to account for the users' factors that might influence the interaction with a robot and the evaluation of user cognitive performance. To this end, we invited senior participants to use a prototype of a robot-led cognitive test and analyzed the influence of personality traits and user's empathy on the cognitive performance and technology acceptance.

The empirical understanding of the drivers of visitors' intentions to use robots in such services has become an urgent necessity for their sustainable deployment. Certainly, using social androids within hospitality services requires organisations' attentive commitment to value creation and fulfilling service quality expectations. In this paper, via structural equation modelling (SEM) and semi-structured interviews with managers, we conceptualise and empirically test visitors' intentions to use social robots in hospitality services. With data collected in Singapore's hospitality settings, we found visitors' intentions to use social robots stem from the effects of technology acceptance variables, service quality dimensions leading to perceived value, and two further dimensions from human robot interaction (HRI): empathy and information sharing. Analysis of these dimensions' importance provides a deeper understanding of novel opportunities managers may take advantage of to position social robot-delivered services in tourism and hospitality strategies.","2020-06","2021-04-19 15:56:07","2021-04-19 15:56:07","","","","","78","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND Publisher: ELSEVIER SCI LTD Type: Article","","","","","Artificial intelligence; Hospitality services; Human-robot interaction; Intention to use robots; Social robots","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This article analyzes the impact of strategic stability of the use of AI in the strategic decision-making process, in particular, the risks and trade-offs of pre-delegating military force (or automating escalation) to machines. It argues that AI-enabled decision support tools, by substituting the role of human critical thinking, empathy, creativity, and intuition in the strategic decision-making process, will be fundamentally destabilizing if defense planners come to view AI's `support' function as a panacea for the cognitive fallibilities and human analysis and decision-making. The article also considers the nefarious use of AI-enhanced fake news, deepfakes, bots, and other forms of social media by non-state actors and state proxy actors, which might cause states to exaggerate a threat from ambiguous or manipulated information, increasing instability.","","2021-04-19 15:56:07","2021-04-19 15:56:07","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND Publisher: ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD Type: Article; Early Access","","","","","-China relations; Artificial intelligence; deterrence policy; emerging technology; nuclear security; S; strategic stability; U","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this work, we aim to examine AI roles in early design stages. The human ideation components and design tools related to AI are discussed in a framework of AI-augmented design support. The framework develops a hierarchy of design cognition (basis), approaches and principles. The cognitive models are constructed in an empirical study of 30 designers (26 for analysis, 4 for pilot study) by concurrent Think-Aloud protocol and behavior analysis. The process of producing new design ideas is explained by a transparent analysis of designers' language and behaviors. Three strategies to organize cognitive activities in design ideation are summarized: develop structured consideration, relate to a scenario, and stick-to designing. These strategies suggest AI could act as (1) representation creation, (2) empathy trigger and (3) engagement, in principles of “knowledge-driven” and “decompose-and-integrate”. The design support with AI provides new perspectives on computer-based design tools that limit to well-defined design variables. The framework is built on a generic notion of design activity and “mimic” human design rationales, expected to benefit research of domain-independent computational design supports and cognitive supports.","2020-11-01","2021-04-19 15:56:08","2021-04-19 15:56:08","","511-544","","5-6","35","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA Publisher: TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC Type: Article","","","","","artificial intelligence; design supports; Human computer interaction theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The epistemological approach helps us to clarify whether we can empathize with artificial intelligence or, more precisely, with social robots. The main puzzle here concerns, among other things, exactly what it is that we empathize with if robots do not have emotions or beliefs, since they do not have a consciousness in an elaborate sense. However, by comparing robots with fictional characters, the paper shows that we can still empathize with robots and that many of the existing accounts of empathy and mindreading are compatible with such a view. By so doing, the paper focuses on the significance of perspective-taking and claims that we also ascribe to robots something like a perspectival experience. The normative approach examines the moral impact of empathizing with robots. In this regard, the paper critically discusses three possible responses: strategic, anti-barbarizational, and pragmatist. The latter position is defended by stressing that we are increasingly compelled to interact with robots in a shared world and that to take robots into our moral consideration should be seen as an integral part of our self- and other-understanding.","2020-12","2021-04-19 15:56:08","2021-04-19 15:56:08","","881-897","","4","11","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article","","","","","Artificial intelligence; Empathy; Ethics; Fictional characters; Humanoid robots; Interaction; Perspective-taking","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Socially-assistive robots (SAR) have been used to reduce pain and distress in children in medical settings. Patients who perceive empathic treatment have increased satisfaction and improved outcomes. We sought to determine if an empathic SAR could be developed and used to decrease pain and fear associated with peripheral IV placement in children. Methods. We conducted a pilot study of children receiving IV placement. Participating children were randomized to interact with (1) no robot, or a commercially available 3D printed humanoid SAR robot programmed with (2) empathy or (3) distraction conditions. Children and parents completed demographic surveys, and children used an adapted validated questionnaire to rate the robot's empathy on an 8-point Likert scale. Survey scores were compared by the t-test or chi-square test. Pain and fear were measured by self-report using the FACES and FEAR scales, and video tapes were coded using the CHEOPS and FLACC. Scores were compared using repeated measures 2-way ANOVA. This trial is registered with . Results. Thirty-one children with an average age of 9.6 years completed the study. For all measures, mean pain and fear scores were lowest in the empathy group immediately before and after IV placement. Children were more likely to attribute characteristics of empathy to the empathic condition (Likert score 7.24 v. 4.70; p=0.012) and to report that having the empathic vs. distraction robot made the IV hurt less (7.45 vs. 4.88; p=0.026). Conclusions. Children were able to identify SAR designed to display empathic characteristics and reported it helped with IV insertion pain and fear. Mean scores of self-reported or objective pain and fear scales were the lowest in the empathy group and the highest in the distraction condition before and after IV insertion. This result suggests empathy improves SAR functionality when used for painful medical procedures and informs future research into SAR for pain management.","2020-04-09","2021-04-19 15:56:08","2021-04-19 15:56:08","","","","","2020","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND Publisher: HINDAWI LTD Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since the creation of social media platforms, numerous studies dealt with measuring personality traits by gathering users' information from their social media profiles. Real world applications showed how natural language processing combined with supervised machine learning algorithms are effective in this field. These applications have some limitations such as focusing on English text only and not considering polysemy in text. In this paper, we propose a multilingual model that handles polysemy by analyzing sentences as a semantic ensemble of interconnected words. The proposed approach processes Facebook posts from the myPersonality dataset and it turns them into a high-dimensional array of features, which are then exploited by a deep neural network architecture based on transformer to perform regression. We prove the effectiveness of our work by comparing the mean squared error of our model with existing baselines and the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the relative data distributions.

In recent years, the quest for greater efficiency in health care, including economic efficiency, has often resulted in the side-lining of these values, making it difficult for health-care professionals to incorporate them in practice. Artificial intelligence is increasingly being used in health care. This technology promises greater efficiency and more free time for health-care professionals to focus on the human side of care, including fostering trust relationships and engaging with patients with empathy and compassion. This article considers the vision of efficient, empathetic and trustworthy health care put forward by the proponents of artificial intelligence. The paper suggests that artificial intelligence has the potential to fundamentally alter the way in which empathy, compassion and trust are currently regarded and practised in health care. Moving forward, it is important to re-evaluate whether and how these values could be incorporated and practised within a health-care system where artificial intelligence is increasingly used.

This article considers the ethical concerns of autonomy, community, transparency, identity, value, and empathy to evaluate the ethics of such deployment of robots. In doing so it provides a response to the Richardson et al. article in IEEE Technology and Society Magazine, Mar. 2018 [20]. This article concludes that deployment of robots to control the behavior of autistic children is ethically suspect and should be questioned. The use of robots with children should be evaluated on the basis of the purpose of and process by which such robots are deployed, rather than on the basis of the technology itself. Particularly important is the roboticist's empathy with the user of the robot, and gaining an understanding of the individual child. The paper suggests how an understanding of the autistic child might lead to sensitive deployment of a robot to help the child manage social environments through supporting the child's regulation of emotions.","2020-03","2021-04-19 15:56:09","2021-04-19 15:56:09","","51-60","","1","39","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA Publisher: IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC Type: Article","","","","","Autism; Ethics; Medical treatment; Pediatrics; Robot sensing systems; Social implications of technology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The goal of this mixed-methods study was to understand teens' operation of, and responsiveness to, a robot only capable of movement compared to a robot only capable of speech. Stemming from a human-centered approach, we introduce a Participatory Wizard of Oz (PWoz) interaction method that engaged teens as operators, users, and witnesses in a uniquely transparent interaction. In this paper, we illustrate the use of the PWoz interaction method as well as how it helps identify engaging robot interactions. Using this technique, we present results from a study with 62 teens that includes details of the complexity of teen stress and a significant reduction in negative attitudes toward robots after interactions. We analyzed the teens' interactions with both the verbal and non-verbal robots and identified strong themes of (1) authenticity, (2) empathy, (3) emotional engagement, and (4) imperfection creates connection.

An untested implication of this hypothesis is that these stable patterns of connectivity should be visible even in the absence of empathy tasks. Using machine learning, we demonstrate that patterns of resting state fMRI connectivity (i.e. the degree of synchronous BOLD activity across multiple cortical areas in the absence of explicit task demands) of resonance and control networks predict trait empathic concern (n = 58). Empathic concern was also predicted by connectivity patterns within the somatomotor network. These findings further support the role of resonance-control network interactions and of somatomotor function in our vicariously driven concern for others.

This assessment, run entirely on a tablet, measures decision-making via a suite of neurocognitive tests in less than 30 minutes. The software measures several cognitive and decision-making traits of the user, including impulsivity, empathy, aggression, and several other traits linked to reoffending. Our analysis measured whether this assessment successfully predicted recidivism by testing probationers in a large urban city (Houston, TX, United States) from 2017 to 2019. To determine predictive validity, we used machine learning to yield cross-validated receiver-operator characteristics. Results gave a recidivism prediction value of 0.70, making it comparable to commonly used risk assessments. This novel approach diverges from traditional self-reporting, interview-based, and criminal-records-based approaches, and can also add a protective layer against bias, while strengthening model accuracy in predicting reoffense. In addition, subjectivity is eliminated and time-consuming administrative efforts are reduced.

Unfair reviews, created when requesters consider factors outside of a worker's control, are known to plague gig workers and can result in lost job opportunities and even termination from the marketplace. Our tool leverages machine learning to implement an intelligent interface that: (1) uses deep learning to automatically detect when an individual has included unfair factors into her review (factors outside the worker's control per the policies of the market); and (2) prompts the individual to reconsider her review if she has incorporated unfair factors. To study the effectiveness of Reputation Agent, we conducted a controlled experiment over different gig markets. Our experiment illustrates that across markets, Reputation Agent, in contrast with traditional approaches, motivates requesters to review gig workers' performance more fairly. We discuss how tools that bring more transparency to employers about the policies of a gig market can help build empathy thus resulting in reasoned discussions around potential injustices towards workers generated by these interfaces. Our vision is that with tools that promote truth and transparency we can bring fairer treatment to gig workers.","2020","2021-04-19 15:56:10","2021-04-19 15:56:10","","1228-1240","","","","","","","","","","","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: Assoc Comp Machinery; Quanta Comp; Taiwan Mobile Co Ltd; Chunghwa Telecom; Microsoft; Taipei City Govt, Dept Informat Technol; Zoom; FET; Web4Good; ELTA HD; ELTA Technol Co Ltd; Facebook; Yahoo Res; Pinterest Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>29th Web Conference (WWW), Taipei, TAIWAN, APR 20-24, 2020</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One approach is using a dialogue strategy in which the robot makes a remark based on previous dialogues with users. However, privacy problems may occur owing to private information of the user being mentioned. We propose a novel dialogue strategy whereby a robot mentions another robot in the form of gossiping. This dialogue strategy can improve the sense of conversation, which results in increased interest while avoiding the privacy issue. We examined our proposal by conducting a conversation experiment evaluated by subject impressions. The results demonstrated that the proposed method could help the robot to obtain higher evaluations. In particular, the perceived mind was improved in the Likert scale evaluation, whereas the robot empathy and intention to use were improved in the binary comparison evaluation. Our dialogue strategy may contribute to understanding the factors regarding the sense of conversation, thereby adding value to the field of human-robot interaction.","2020","2021-04-19 15:56:11","2021-04-19 15:56:11","","653-658","","","","","","","IEEE RO-MAN","","","","IEEE","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: IEEE; IEEE Robot & Automat Soc; Robot Soc Japan; Korean Robot Soc; Furhat Robot; EurAi; Assoc Italiana Lingusitica Computazionale; Assoc Italiana Scienze Voce; Springer; Robotics ISSN: 1944-9445 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>29th IEEE International Conference on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (IEEE RO-MAN), ELECTR NETWORK, AUG 31-SEP 04, 2020</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, inappropriate communication of self-tracking results might cause the opposite effect. Subtle self-tracking feedback is an alternative that can be provided with the aid of an artificial agent representing the self. Hence, we propose a wearable pet that reflects the user's affective states through visual and haptic feedback. By eliciting empathy and fostering helping behaviors towards it, users would indirectly help themselves. A wearable prototype was built, and three user studies performed to evaluate the appropriateness of the proposed affective representations. Visual representations using facial and body cues were clear for valence and less clear for arousal. Haptic interoceptive patterns emulating heart-rate levels matched the desired feedback urgency levels with a saturation frequency. The integrated visuo-haptic representations matched to participants own affective experience. From the results, we derived three design guidelines for future robot mirroring wearable systems: physical embodiment, interoceptive feedback, and customization.","2020","2021-04-19 15:56:11","2021-04-19 15:56:11","","1328-1333","","","","","","","IEEE RO-MAN","","","","IEEE","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: IEEE; IEEE Robot & Automat Soc; Robot Soc Japan; Korean Robot Soc; Furhat Robot; EurAi; Assoc Italiana Lingusitica Computazionale; Assoc Italiana Scienze Voce; Springer; Robotics ISSN: 1944-9445 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>29th IEEE International Conference on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (IEEE RO-MAN), ELECTR NETWORK, AUG 31-SEP 04, 2020</p>","","","","embodiment; empathy and intersubjectivity; haptic feedback; human-machine interaction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, cognitive skills are not sufficient for a successful life. Understanding and managing the emotions of oneself is another crucial factor in success. The current state of the art teaching methods educates the kids about programming and emotional intelligence independently. In our opinion, it is advantageous to teach kids emotional intelligence, along with the programming concepts. However, the literature lacks the studies that make students emotionally aware while teaching them programming. This research aims to prepare students to be cognitively healthy as well as emotionally intelligent with the hypothesis that a kid's emotional intelligence can be enhanced while teaching them cognitive skills. We proposed a computational model that teaches programming and emotional intelligence side by side to students. The model provides a curriculum and related tools. For evaluations, five hundred students of a public school were involved in different activities to find the effectiveness of the proposed model. These students were divided into five groups (A, B, C, D, and E), each having a mean age of 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 years, respectively. Students performed multiple adaptive scenarios of path-finding that were based on self-awareness, social-awareness, sharing, and empathy emotions. Students provide the programming instructions such as sequencing, conditional statements, and looping to a robot. The children have successfully improved in both fundamental programming constructs and emotional intelligence skills. The research also successfully reduced screen time problem by providing a screen-free student interface.","2020","2021-04-19 15:56:13","2021-04-19 15:56:13","","149616-149629","","","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA Publisher: IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC Type: Article","","","","","basic programming; Computational modeling; Education; Emotional intelligence; Programming profession; Robots; robots based learning; screen-free interface; Sequential analysis; Tools","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Part I briefly describes some of the ways AI is already in use in ordinary life - from facial recognition, through medical diagnosis to translation services. Part II describes how AI is transforming what it means to provide legal services in six primary areas: litigation review; expertise automation; legal research; contract analytics; contract and litigation document generation; and predictive analytics. Part III explores who are the providers of these AI driven legal services - often non-lawyer legal service providers - and how these providers are replacing at least some of what clients have traditionally sought from lawyers. Part III also discusses the implications of all these changes both for the future role of lawyers individually, and in particular what services will clients still need lawyers to perform: judgment, empathy, creativity and adaptability. In turn, this Part examines what will these changes mean for the size, shape, composition and economic model of law firms, as well as the implications of these changes for legal education and lawyer training. Part IV identifies the principal legal, ethical, regulatory and risk management issues raised by the use of AI in the provision of legal services. Finally, in Part V the article considers who will be the likely providers of AI based services other than law firms: legal publishers, major accounting firms and venture capital funded businesses.","2020","2021-04-19 15:56:15","2021-04-19 15:56:15","","","","1","16","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: RUA ROCHA, 23 11 ANDAR, SAO PAULO SP, 01330-0000, BRAZIL Publisher: FUNDACAO GETULIO VARGAS, ESCOLA DIREITO Type: Article","","","","","Artificial Intelligence (AI); Future of Legal Services; Law Firms; Lawyers; Legal Service Providers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This article presents a new framework, the 3S Process, as a method for teaching leaders how to strategically adopt AI within their organizations. At a high-level, the 3S Process consists of three stages (Story, Strategy, and Solution), which are described in detail in the article. Stage 1: Story in the process is inspired by the Harvard Case Method to provide context for a problem. Stage 2: Strategy uses Design Thinking to produce candidate solutions. The substage of Empathy in Design Thinking plays a crucial role to reduce bias in designing AI. Virtualization technology is a tool for students to experience hands-on learning in prototype development. Stage 3: Solution is where students advocate for their conceptual AI solution in the context of the case study. AI is a type of complex system; therefore, students should consider feedback loops and the potential for unintended biases to enter a deployed solution. The presentation of the 3S Process in this article is conceptual. Further empirical studies, including evaluations of the 3S Process in classroom settings, will be considered in the future.","2019-12","2021-04-19 15:56:15","2021-04-19 15:56:15","","36-42","","12","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: DUNTON TOWER RM 2122, 1125 COLONEL BY DR, OTTAWA, ON K1A 5B6, CANADA Publisher: CARLETON UNIV GRAPHIC SERVICES Type: Article","","","","","3S Process; Artificial Intelligence; Business Education; Design Thinking; Harvard Case Method","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One such problem of particular importance is the low accuracy of predictions. This paper suggests that users' help is a practical approach to improve accuracy and it considers four factors that trigger users' willingness to help for an imperfect AI system. The two factors covered in Study 1 are utilitarian benefit based on egoistic motivation, and empathy based on altruistic motivation. In Study 2, utilitarian benefit is divided into explainable AI and monetary reward. The results indicate that two variables, namely empathy and monetary reward, have significant positive effects on willingness to help, and monetary reward is the strongest stimulus. In addition, explainable AI is shown to be positively associated with trust in AI. This study applies social studies of help motivation to the HCI field in order to induce users' willingness to help for an imperfect AI. The triggers of help motivation, empathy and monetary reward, can be utilized to induce the users' voluntary engagement in the loop with an imperfect AI.","2019-12","2021-04-19 15:56:15","2021-04-19 15:56:15","","180-196","","","101","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND Publisher: PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD Type: Article","","","","","AI (Artificial Intelligence); Explainable AI; Food image recognition; Human in the loop (HITL); Trust; Willingness to help","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We draw on a particular line of posthumanist theory associated closely with the work of Karen Barad, Rosi Braidotti and N. Katherine Hayles that suggests a constantly permeable, fluid and extended subjectivity, displacing the boundaries between human and other. In doing so, we propose a posthuman concept of empathy in gameplay, and we apply this concept to data from the first author's 18-month ethnographic field notes of gameplay in the MMORPG World of Warcraft. Exploring these data through our analysis of posthuman empathy, we demonstrate the entanglement of avatar-player, machine-human relationship. We show how empathy allows us to understand this relationship as constantly negotiated and in process, producing visceral reactions in the intra-connected avatar-player subject as well as moments of co-produced in-game action that require `affective matching' between subjective and embodied experiences. We argue that this account of the avatar-player relationship extends research in game culture, providing a horizontal, non-hierarchical discussion of its most necessary interaction.","2019-12","2021-04-19 15:56:16","2021-04-19 15:56:16","","791-806","","5-6","25","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 2455 ℡LER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA Publisher: SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC Type: Article","","","","","Avatar-player relationships; digital culture; embodiment; empathy; MMORPG; posthuman; posthuman empathy; posthuman subjectivity; World of Warcraft","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For this purpose, we used an immersive reality treadmill equipment and developed a 3D avatar, with instantly modifiable parameters for knee flexion and extension (acceleration or deceleration). Fourteen healthy young adults, equipped with motion capture markers, were asked to walk at a self-selected pace on the treadmill. A real-time 3D image of their lower limbs was modelized and projected on the screen ahead of them, as if in a walking motion from left to right. The subjects were instructed to continue walking. When we initiated an increase in the knee flexion of the avatar, we observed a similar increase in the subjects' knee flexion. No significant results were observed when the modification involved a decrease in knee flexion. The results and their significance are discussed using theories encompassing empathy, sympathy and sensory re-calibration. The prospect of using this type of modified avatar for stroke rehabilitation is discussed.","2019-11","2021-04-19 15:56:16","2021-04-19 15:56:16","","","","11","5","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND Publisher: ELSEVIER SCI LTD Type: Article","","","","","Adaptation; Avatar; Biomedical engineering; Empathy; Knee flexion; Neuroscience; Rehabilitation; Sympathy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the traditional use of didactic lectures for communication skills training is ineffective, and the use of standardized patients is not time- or cost-effective. Given the abilities of virtual patients (VPs) to simulate interactive and authentic clinical scenarios in secured environments with unlimited training attempts, a virtual counseling application is an ideal platform for nursing students to hone their communication skills before their clinical postings. Objective: The aim of this study was to develop and test the use of VPs to better prepare nursing undergraduates for communicating with real-life patients, their family members, and other health care professionals during their clinical postings. Methods: The stages of the creation of VPs included preparation, design, and development, followed by a testing phase before the official implementation. An initial voice chatbot was trained using a natural language processing engine, Google Cloud's Dialogflow, and was later visualized into a three-dimensional (3D) avatar form using Unity 3D. Results: The VPs included four case scenarios that were congruent with the nursing undergraduates' semesters' learning objectives: (1) assessing the pain experienced by a pregnant woman, (2) taking the history of a depressed patient, (3) escalating a bleeding episode of a postoperative patient to a physician, and (4) showing empathy to a stressed-out fellow final-year nursing student. Challenges arose in terms of content development, technological limitations, and expectations management, which can be resolved by contingency planning, open communication, constant program updates, refinement, and training. Conclusions: The creation of VPs to assist in nursing students' communication skills training may provide authentic learning environments that enhance students' perceived self-efficacy and confidence in effective communication skills. However, given the infancy stage of this project, further refinement and constant enhancements are needed to train the VPs to simulate real-life conversations before the official implementation.","2019-10-29","2021-04-19 15:56:16","2021-04-19 15:56:16","","","","10","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 130 QUEENS QUAY E, STE 1102, TORONTO, ON M5A 0P6, CANADA Publisher: JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC Type: Article","","","","","artificial intelligence; communication; learning; nursing education; patients; technology; virtual reality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A useful thought experiment is the application of the Turing test to user-facing artificial intelligence systems in health care. In this paper I argue that many medical decisions require value judgements and the doctor-patient relationship requires empathy and understanding to arrive at a shared decision, often handling large areas of uncertainty and balancing competing risks. Arguably, medicine requires wisdom more than intelligence, artificial or otherwise. Artificial intelligence therefore needs to supplement rather than replace medical professionals, and identifying the complementary positioning of artificial intelligence in medical consultation is a key challenge for the future. In health care, artificial intelligence needs to pass the implementation game, not the imitation game.","2019-10-28","2021-04-19 15:56:17","2021-04-19 15:56:17","","","","10","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 130 QUEENS QUAY E, STE 1102, TORONTO, ON M5A 0P6, CANADA Publisher: JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC Type: Article","","","","","artificial intelligence; chatbots; conversational agents; digital health; ehealth; machine learning; medical informatics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

How people react to these agents is telling about the perceived empathy of such agents. Mistreatment of robots (or computers) by co-workers might provoke such telling reactions. This study examines perceived mistreatment directed towards a robot in comparison to a computer. This will provide some understanding of how people feel about robots in collaborative social settings. We conducted a two by two between-subjects study with 80 participants. Participants worked cooperatively with either a robot or a computer agent. An experiment confederate would either act aggressively or neutrally towards the agent. We hypothesized that people would not perceive aggressive speech as mistreatment when an agent was capable of emotional feelings and similar to themselves; that participants would perceive the robot as more similar in appearance and emotionally capable to themselves than a computer; and so would observe more mistreatment with a robot. The final results supported our hypotheses; the participants observed greater mistreatment for the robot, but not the computer. Also participants felt significantly more sympathetic towards the robot and believed that it was much more emotionally capable.","2019-12","2021-04-19 15:56:17","2021-04-19 15:56:17","","727-739","","5","11","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article","","","","","Human-robot cooperation; Human-robot interaction; Mistreatment; Perception","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A fundamental requirement in all social interactions is the ability to engage, maintain, and demonstrate attention. Attentional behaviors include leaning forward, self-disclosure, and changes in voice pitch. Objective: This study aimed to examine the effect of robot attentional behaviors on user perceptions and behaviors in a simulated health care interaction. Methods: A parallel randomized controlled trial with a 1:1:1 allocation ration was conducted. We randomized participants to 1 of 4 experimental conditions before engaging in a scripted face-to-face interaction with a fully automated medical receptionist robot. Experimental conditions included a self-disclosure condition, voice pitch change condition, forward lean condition, and neutral condition. Participants completed paper-based postinteraction measures relating to engagement, perceived robot attention, and perceived robot empathy. We video recorded interactions and coded for participant attentional behaviors. Results: A total of 181 participants were recruited from the University of Auckland. Participants who interacted with the robot in the forward lean and self-disclosure conditions found the robot to be significantly more stimulating than those who interacted with the robot in the voice pitch or neutral conditions (P=.03). Participants in the forward lean, self-disclosure, and neutral conditions found the robot to be significantly more interesting than those in the voice pitch condition (P<.001). Participants in the forward lean and self-disclosure conditions spent significantly more time looking at the robot than participants in the neutral condition (P<.001). Significantly, more participants in the self-disclosure condition laughed during the interaction (P=.01), whereas significantly more participants in the forward lean condition leant toward the robot during the interaction (P<.001). Conclusions: The use of self-disclosure and forward lean by a health care robot can increase human engagement and attentional behaviors. Voice pitch changes did not increase attention or engagement. The small effects with regard to participant perceptions are potentially because of the limitations in self-report measures or a lack of comparison for most participants who had never interacted with a robot before. Further research could explore the use of self-disclosure and forward lean using a within-subjects design and in real health care settings.","2019-10-04","2021-04-19 15:56:17","2021-04-19 15:56:17","","","","10","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 130 QUEENS QUAY E, STE 1102, TORONTO, ON M5A 0P6, CANADA Publisher: JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC Type: Article","","","","","engagement; health care robotics; robotics; social intelligence; social interaction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Curtis","An Essay on Narrative, Reality, and Imagination","PSYCHOANALYTIC INQUIRY","","0735-1690","10.1080/07351690.2019.1659025","","Narrative is a verbal account, a story of related events which can be factual, fictional or both. Life experience and imagination are as essential to narrative as narrative is to mankind. The phylogenic perspective of literature suggests an inborn capacity for empathy, intelligence and inventiveness, whereas the ontological example is variable. Western knowledge, politics and ethics have evolved from their narrative of Greek myth, epic and drama, the few medieval writers, singularly by the Elizabethan theater, importantly the Arthurian legend and romance stories, English and Russian novels, and uniquely the American short story. This heritage progressively demarcated such life themes as the hero, maiden and adversary; love, hate and indifference; loyalty, deception and betrayal; desire, achievement and loss. These characterizations of self and other remain relevant to the contemporary novel, cinema/TV, and theater, as well as the news, commentary, and real life. Conversely, postmodern assumptions challenge that individual subjectivity determines what is real, valid or authentic, consequently the relativism of traditional, institutional and historical precedents of the truth. Further, the computer, gaming, smart device, and artificial intelligence have changed the content and function of customary narrative. Nonetheless, narrative ? real and imagined, ancient and new ? retains the meaning of a story about connected events which variously transcends the boundaries of difference.","2019-10-03","2021-04-19 15:56:18","2021-04-19 15:56:18","","476-484","","7, SI","39","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND Publisher: ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this article, this hypothesis is argued from several viewpoints towards its verification. A developmental process of empathy, morality, and ethics based on the mirror neuron system (MNS) that promotes the emergence of the concept of self (and others) scaffolds the emergence of artificial minds. Firstly, an outline of the ideological background on issues of the mind in a broad sense is shown, followed by the limitation of the current progress of artificial intelligence (AI), focusing on deep learning. Next, artificial pain is introduced, along with its architectures in the early stage of self-inflicted experiences of pain, and later, in the sharing stage of the pain between self and others. Then, cognitive developmental robotics (CDR) is revisited for two important concepts-physical embodiment and social interaction, both of which help to shape conscious minds. Following the working hypothesis, existing studies of CDR are briefly introduced and missing issues are indicated. Finally, the issue of how robots (artificial systems) could be moral agents is addressed.","2019-09","2021-04-19 15:56:18","2021-04-19 15:56:18","","","","3","4","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND Publisher: MDPI Type: Article","","","","","empathy; mirror neuron system (MNS); morality; pain","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, only few studies have investigated how functional network changes are related to social anhedonia. The aim of this fMRI study was to classify subjects according to their degree of social anhedonia using supervised machine learning. More specifically, we extracted both spatial and temporal network features during a social cognition task from 70 subjects, and used support vector machines for classification. Since impairment in social cognition is well established in schizophrenia-spectrum disorders, the subjects performed a comic strip task designed to specifically probe theory of mind (ToM) and empathy processing. Features representing both temporal (time series) and network dynamics were extracted using task activation maps, seed region analysis, independent component analysis (ICA), and a newly developed multi-subject archetypal analysis (MSAA), which here aimed to further bridge aspects of both seed region analysis and decomposition by incorporating a spotlight approach.We found significant classification of subjects with elevated levels of social anhedonia when using the times series extracted using MSAA, indicating that temporal dynamics carry important information for classification of social anhedonia. Interestingly, we found that the same time series yielded the highest classification performance in a task classification of the ToM condition. Finally, the spatial network corresponding to that time series included both prefrontal and temporal-parietal regions as well as insula activity, which previously have been related schizotypy and the development of schizophrenia.","2019-12-01","2021-04-19 15:56:18","2021-04-19 15:56:18","","4965-4981","","17","40","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article","","","","","archetypical analysis; decomposition; functional connectivity; social anhedonia; support vector classification","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Similar to the amygdala, the instantaneous emergency emotion is first computed more quickly in a low-redundancy convolutional neural network compressed by pruning and weight sharing with hashing trick. Then, the real-time process emotion is identified more accurately by the memory level neural networks, which is good at handling time-related signals. Finally, the intracranial emotion is recognized in personalized hidden Markov models.

However, it is not known whether real-world altruists' heightened empathy reflects true self-other mapping of multi-voxel neural response patterns. We investigated this relationship in adults who had engaged in extraordinarily costly real-world altruism: donating a kidney to a stranger. Altruists and controls completed fMRI testing while anticipating and experiencing pain, and watching as a stranger anticipated and experienced pain. Machine learning classifiers tested for shared representation between experienced and observed distress. Altruists exhibited more similar representations of experienced and observed fearful anticipation spontaneously and following an empathy prompt in anterior insula and anterior/middle cingulate cortex, respectively, suggesting heightened empathic proclivities and abilities for fear. During pain epochs, altruists were distinguished by spontaneous empathic responses in anterior insula, anterior/mid-cingulate cortex and supplementary motor area, but showed no difference from controls after the empathy prompt. These findings (1) link shared multi-voxel representations of the distress of self and others to real-world costly altruism, (2) reinforce distinctions between empathy for sensory states like pain and anticipatory affective states like fear, and (3) highlight the importance of differentiating between the proclivity and ability to empathize.","2019-07-24","2021-04-19 15:56:19","2021-04-19 15:56:19","","","","","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND Publisher: NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Participants wore a Head Mounted Display tracking their head movements and displaying the 3D visual scene taken from the eyes of a robot which was positioned in front of a mirror and piloted by the subjects' head movements. As a result, participants saw themselves as a robot. When participant' and robot's head movements were correlated, participants felt that they were incorporated into the robot with a sense of agency. Critically, the robot they embodied was judged more likeable and socially closer. Remarkably, we found that the beaming experience with correlated head movements and corresponding sensation of embodiment and social proximity, was independent of robots' humanoid's appearance.

METHODS: Nurse recognition comments were collected from a convenience sample of 3 organizations via an IPC inpatient platform and analyzed using the AI techniques of natural language processing, machine learning, sentiment analytics, and corollary dictionaries based on rules of linguistics. RESULTS: The top theme of nursing recognition comments was courtesy and respect with the behaviors of empathy/compassion, helpfulness, kindness, attentiveness, and emotional comfort. The theme of skills/knowledge was the 2nd most common, with the behaviors of being professional, knowledgeable, keeping track, competence, dedication, and being thorough. CONCLUSIONS: AI techniques for qualitative analysis of comments collected through IPC reveal nurse themes and behaviors most meaningful to patients and their family members.

Internal motivational factors for studying medicine (e.g., care for patients, save lives) coupled with a deep approach to learning have been positively related to empathy in contrast to external motivational factors (e.g., future earning potential, prestige) and surface learning. However, assessments of these assumptions among medical school candidates are scarce. This study examined the relationship between different motivational factors and empathy among students enrolled in a selection year in medicineby testing the mediating role of learning approaches. A sample of 572 candidates for medical studies answered a self-reported questionnaire half way through their selection year. Measures included internal and external motivational factors for studying medicine, deep and surface learning approaches and empathy. Path-analysis tested the mediation effects of deep and surface approaches to learning on the relationship of internal and external motivational factors with empathy. The deep learning approach partially mediated the significant positive association between internal motivational factors and empathy, while the surface learning approach fully mediated the significant negative association between external motivational factors and empathy. These results suggest that learning approaches could be a pathway by which internal and external motives for studying medicine are related to empathy among medical school candidates. Pedagogical strategies and educational environments accounting for individual differences in motivation and learning may contribute to training students to become professional and caring doctors in the future.","2019-05","2021-04-19 15:56:21","2021-04-19 15:56:21","","287-300","","2","24","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article","","","","","Empathy; Learning approaches; Motivational factors; Undergraduate medical students","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the present study, we combined functional neuroimaging with a robot socializing intervention to probe the flexibility of empathy, a core component of social relationships, towards robots. Twenty-six individuals underwent identical fMRI sessions before and after being issued a social robot to take home and interact with over the course of a week. While undergoing fMRI, participants observed videos of a human actor or a robot experiencing pain or pleasure in response to electrical stimulation. Repetition suppression of activity in the pain network, a collection of brain regions associated with empathy and emotional responding, was measured to test whether socializing with a social robot leads to greater overlap in neural mechanisms when observing human and robotic agents experiencing pain or pleasure. In contrast to our hypothesis, functional region-of-interest analyses revealed no change in neural overlap for agents after the socializing intervention. Similarly, no increase in activation when observing a robot experiencing pain emerged post-socializing. Whole-brain analysis showed that, before the socializing intervention, superior parietal and early visual regions are sensitive to novel agents, while after socializing, medial temporal regions show agent sensitivity. A region of the inferior parietal lobule was sensitive to novel emotions, but only during the pre-socializing scan session. Together, these findings suggest that a short socialization intervention with a social robot does not lead to discernible differences in empathy towards the robot, as measured by behavioural or brain responses. We discuss the extent to which long-term socialization with robots might shape social cognitive processes and ultimately our relationships with these machines.

In the present study, we investigated the relationship between mimicry and cognitive and emotional empathy. To assess mimicry, facial electromyography was recorded for 70 participants while they completed the Multifaceted Empathy Test, which presents complex context-embedded emotional expressions. As predicted, inter-individual differences in emotional and cognitive empathy were associated with the level of facial mimicry. For positive emotions, the intensity of the mimicry response scaled with the level of state emotional empathy. Mimicry was stronger for the emotional empathy task compared to the cognitive empathy task. The specific empathy condition could be successfully detected from facial muscle activity at the level of single individuals using machine learning techniques. These results support the view that mimicry occurs depending on the social context as a tool to affiliate and it is involved in cognitive as well as emotional empathy.","2019-11-17","2021-04-19 15:56:22","2021-04-19 15:56:22","","1672-1686","","8","33","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND Publisher: ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD Type: Article","","","","","cognitive; complex emotions; emotional; empathy; Facial mimicry","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Objective: This study aimed to explore general practitioners' (GPs') opinions about the potential impact of future technology on key tasks in primary care. Methods: In June 2018, we conducted a Web-based survey of 720 UK GPs' opinions about the likelihood of future technology to fully replace GPs in performing 6 key primary care tasks, and, if respondents considered replacement for a particular task likely, to estimate how soon the technological capacity might emerge. This study involved qualitative descriptive analysis of written responses (”comments”) to an open-ended question in the survey. Results: Comments were classified into 3 major categories in relation to primary care: (1) limitations of future technology, (2) potential benefits of future technology, and (3) social and ethical concerns. Perceived limitations included the beliefs that communication and empathy are exclusively human competencies; many GPs also considered clinical reasoning and the ability to provide value-based care as necessitating physicians' judgments. Perceived benefits of technology included expectations about improved efficiencies, in particular with respect to the reduction of administrative burdens on physicians. Social and ethical concerns encompassed multiple, divergent themes including the need to train more doctors to overcome workforce shortfalls and misgivings about the acceptability of future technology to patients. However, some GPs believed that the failure to adopt technological innovations could incur harms to both patients and physicians. Conclusions: This study presents timely information on physicians' views about the scope of artificial intelligence (AI) in primary care. Overwhelmingly, GPs considered the potential of AI to be limited. These views differ from the predictions of biomedical informaticians. More extensive, stand-alone qualitative work would provide a more in-depth understanding of GPs' views.","2019-03-20","2021-04-19 15:56:23","2021-04-19 15:56:23","","","","3","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 59 WINNERS CIRCLE, TORONTO, ON M4L 3Y7, CANADA Publisher: JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC Type: Article","","","","","artificial intelligence; attitudes; future; general practice; machine learning; opinions; primary care; qualitative research; technology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We address two research questions: (1) Can an autonomous robot designed with empathic competencies foster collaborative learning in a group context? (2) Can an empathic robot sustain positive educational outcomes in long-term collaborative learning interactions with groups of students? To answer these questions, we developed an autonomous robot with empathic competencies that is able to interact with a group of students in a learning activity about sustainable development. Two studies were conducted. The first study compares learning outcomes in children across three conditions: learning with an empathic robot; learning with a robot without empathic capabilities; and learning without a robot. The results show that the autonomous robot with empathy fosters meaningful discussions about sustainability, which is a learning outcome in sustainability education. The second study features groups of students who interact with the robot in a school classroom for 2 months. The long-term educational interaction did not seem to provide significant learning gains, although there was a change in game-actions to achieve more sustainability during game-play. This result reflects the need to perform more long-term research in the field of educational robots for group learning.","2019-03","2021-04-19 15:56:23","2021-04-19 15:56:23","","","","1","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 2 PENN PLAZA, STE 701, NEW YORK, NY 10121-0701 USA Publisher: ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY Type: Article","","","","","collaborative learning; education; empathy; group learning; human-robot interaction; learning gains; Social robotics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The present research aimed to investigate the impact of occupational stereotypes, evoked by attire, as well as posture on person perception. For this, computer animation was used to create avatars with different types of attire (nurse, military, casual) and posture (open, closed). In Study 1 (N=164), participants attributed significantly more empathy to avatars wearing a nurse versus a military uniform or casual outfit. When adding posture as an additional cue, Study 2 (N=312) showed that ratings of empathy and dominance were affected by both attire and posture. This effect was replicated in Study 3 (N=163) for female avatars, in the sense that open postures in nurses increased empathy ratings and decreased dominance ratings, which both in turn led to greater perceived competence. By contrast, for male avatars, posture did not affect attributions of competence directly. Rather, attire predicted perceived dominance directly, as well as through perceived empathy. The present findings suggest that both posture, and occupational information evoked by attire, are used to infer personal characteristics. However, the strength of each cue may vary with the gender of the target.","2019-03","2021-04-19 15:56:24","2021-04-19 15:56:24","","23-38","","1","43","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article","","","","","Body posture; Clothing; Competence; Dominance; Empathy; Occupational stereotypes; Warmth","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

If a robot can identify emotions and intentions of a human interacting with it, interactions with humans can potentially become more natural and effective. However, mechanisms of perception and empathy used by humans to achieve this understanding may not be suitable or adequate for use within robots. Electroencephalography (EEG) can be used for recording signals revealing emotions and motivations from a human brain. This study aimed to evaluate different machine learning techniques to classify EEG data associated with specific affective/emotional states. For experimental purposes, we used visual (IAPS) and physical (Tower of Hanoi) tasks to record human emotional states in the form of EEG data. The obtained EEG data processed, formatted and evaluated using various machine learning techniques to find out which method can most accurately classify EEG data according to associated affective/emotional states. The experiment confirms the choice of a method for improving the accuracy of results. According to the results, Support Vector Machine was the first, and Regression Tree was the second best method for classifying EEG data associated with specific affective/emotional states with accuracies up to 70.00% and 60.00%, respectively.

The system is inspired by advances in biosensing wearables, tattoo displays, brain sensors, robotic agents, artificial intelligence (Al), gestural interaction and 3D holographic displays. By 2030, technological advances will enable us to prototype and investigate questions related to experiential and embodied emotional learning; emotion-based human-computer interaction, affective biosensing, empathetic Al agents, and 3D interactive holographic environments. We envision EmotoTent as a modular, emotion sensing Holodeck. In the EmotoTent program children learn and practice emotion regulation and empathy with peers, pets and a robotic dog agent in ways that are experiential, embodied and playful. We propose EmotoTent as a core element of a K-6 socio-emotional learning curriculum designed to improve school culture through the enhancement of children's ability to regulate emotions and interact with human and non-human species with empathy and compassion. Enhancing these qualities has been shown to lead to reductions in violence and bullying, racism, gender inequality and other forms of marginalization. We predict that the EmotoTent socio-emotional learning program will improve school cultures and create a foundation for children's lifelong well-being.","2019","2021-04-19 15:56:26","2021-04-19 15:56:26","","755-760","","","","","","","","","","","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: Boise State Univ; Stem Act Ctr; St Lukes; Osmo; Langan Barber Fdn; Discovery Ctr Idaho; StemFinity; NSF; Boise Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>18th Annual ACM Interaction Design and Children (IDC), Boise, ID, JUN 12-15, 2019</p>","","","","biosensing; children; embodied learning; Empathy; experiential learning; holographic environments; mind-body interaction; robotic agents","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this regard, human-robot interaction can be improved through the automatic perception of empathy, among other human attributes, allowing robots to affectively adapt their actions to interactants' feelings in any given situation. This paper presents our contribution to the generalised track of the One-Minute Gradual ( OMG) Empathy Prediction Challenge by describing our approach to predict a listener's valence during semi-scripted actor-listener interactions. We extract visual and acoustic features from the interactions and feed them into a bidirectional long short-term memory network to capture the time-dependencies of the valence-based empathy during the interactions. Generalised and personalised unimodal and multimodal valence-based empathy models are then trained to assess the impact of each modality on the system performance. Furthermore, we analyse if intra-subject dependencies on empathy perception affect the system performance. We assess the models by computing the concordance correlation coefficient ( CCC) between the predicted and self-annotated valence scores.

Automated technologies are finding themselves more and more integrated into every aspect of the fight. As technology continues to advance, the United States Military must consider what a human-machine team will look like and how an optimal relationship between the two assets can be formed, especially under the stressful conditions that often characterize military contexts. For a human-machine team in a military context to work at maximum efficiency, an ideal level of empathy towards an automated teammate must be obtained. The goal of this study is to determine the effect stress can have on an individual's empathetic reaction toward a Pepper robot. Twenty-eight participants interacted with a Pepper robot either under stress or not. Empathy toward the robot was measured through subjective assessments as well as by participant decisions to continue interacting with Pepper even though doing so would harm the robot. Although not conclusive, the results suggest an interaction between participant gender and stress on empathy toward the Pepper robot. Women showed more empathy toward Pepper under higher levels of stress than lower levels of stress. However, the opposite was true for men. Men showed less empathy toward Pepper under higher levels of stress. The results of this study could help to inform military training and robot design.","2019","2021-04-19 15:56:32","2021-04-19 15:56:32","","170-175","","","","","","","IEEE Systems and Information Engineering Design Symposium","","","","IEEE","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","English","","","","","","","ISSN: 2639-7439 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>Systems and Information Engineering Design Symposium (SIEDS), Univ Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, APR 26, 2019</p>","","","","Human-machine teaming; Human-robot interaction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our work seeks to bridge the gap between these expectations and reality by designing a fun learning experience with several goals: explaining how chatbots work by mapping utterances to a set of intents, teaching strategies for avoiding conversational breakdowns, and increasing desire to use chatbots by creating feelings of empathy toward them. Our experience, called BigBlueBot, consists of interactions with two chatbots in which breakdowns occur and the user (or chatbot) must recover using one or more repair strategies.

In addition, it was confirmed that the pupil response is effective for supporting the embodied interaction and communication using the developed system. In this paper, in order to realize the smooth interaction between human and robot, we developed a pupil response system using hemispherical displays for enhancing affective conveyance.

Although much work in human-robot interaction describes the meaningful relationships that humans forge with their robots in one-on-one encounters, when robots venture into places where humans cannot go - in search and rescue operations, ocean voyages, or even into space - they do so as part of a large human team. Decisions about what the robot should do and where it should go are therefore the result of large group interactions instead of individual human cognition: the realm of organizational sociology. This talk draws on over a decade of ethnography with NASA's robotic spacecraft missions, specifically focusing on the Mars Exploration Rover mission. Going behind the scenes of the mission, I show the meaning-making, emotional connections, and embodied synergy that scientists develop as they work with their robots millions of miles away on a daily basis. This begins by learning to see through the robots' “eyes” on another planet, yet the peculiar social arrangement of mission work produces a deeper connection to the robot explorers too: one that is no doubt responsible for the extraordinary success and unexpected longevity of the mission team. Studying robotic spacecraft teams demonstrates how humans build a particular and peculiar empathy with their robotic colleagues that goes beyond anthropomorphism. Instead, this case points to the many and unusual ways in which organizations participate in our interactions with, understanding of, and ultimately care for the robots we work with in everyday life.","2019","2021-04-19 15:56:36","2021-04-19 15:56:36","","152","","","","","","","ACM IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction","","","","IEEE","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: Assoc Comp Machinery; IEEE; IEEE Robot & Automat Soc; ACM SIGCHI; ACM SIGAI; AAAI; Korea Tourism Org; Daegu Convent & Visitors Bur; ColorfulDaegu ISSN: 2167-2121 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>14th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), Daegu, SOUTH KOREA, MAR 11-14, 2019</p>","","","","Human-Robot Interaction; Teamwork","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper we present one such robot design: we developed Sam, a robot that learns minimal information about a person's background, and adapts to this background. Our in-the-wild study found that people helped Sam for significantly longer when it adapted to match their background. While initially we saw this as a success, in re-considering our study we started seeing a different angle. Our robot effectively deceived people ( changed its story and text), based on some knowledge of their background, to get more work from them. There was little direct benefit to the person from this adaptation, yet the robot stood to gain free labor. We would like to pose the question to the community: is this simply good robot design, or, is our robot being manipulative?

While basic design is focused on the development of new products for the individual, working towards a more sustainable world demands greater attention to designing for and with communities. Improving design education and examining design-learning outcomes requires a kind of targeted approach that could match the best practices to personalize student learning. Design is complex and design includes balancing the needs of multiple stakeholders. However, there is a gap in the preparation of design education that will be needed in a challenging environment. This paper reviews the history of design thinking in the engineering curriculum. Design thinking education starts with an understanding of its importance with socioeconomic relevance. Through observation and empathy, mapping the designer uses the listening and learning tools for mapping users unarticulated needs, working in a team environment. The designer takes time to think carefully why a certain project is considered and details which aspects of machine learning application can be applied from functional to complete success for the end users. The availability of powerful virtual reality methodologies, have made it possible to consider the realistic needs and visualize scenarios and to explore the design alternatives with new ideas before full scale resource allocation on new ideas. Mid-to-advanced level courses with experimental assignments require that students apply through experimentation the principles and concepts learned in foundation courses. The basic design tools such as axiomatic thinking, theory of inventive problem solving, design iteration and simulation using hardware-in-the loop are discussed with case studies. Consideration of product sustainability with the thoughts of design for disassembly and disposal has emerged as a major part of design thinking. Senior engineering courses center on cross and interdisciplinary design and capstone experiences so that students experience fully guided practice of device design and problem solving, simulating what they are likely to experience in the world. This paper examines the critical issues of design thinking in a curriculum from observation, empathy mapping, validation of the idea, and improvement of idea by virtual reality and machine learning, optimization of the idea by tools such as axiomatic design, hardware in the loop simulation, and finally examining product sustainability causes.","2019","2021-04-19 15:56:39","2021-04-19 15:56:39","","","","","","","","","","","","","AMER SOC MECHANICAL ENGINEERS","THREE PARK AVENUE, NEW YORK, NY 10016-5990 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: Amer Soc Mech Engineers Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>ASMEInternational Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition (IMECE2018), Pittsburgh, PA, NOV 09-15, 2018</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Currently, we investigated if the presence of a facial wound enhanced the perception of mental capacities (experience and agency) in response to images of robotic and human-like avatars, compared with unharmed avatars. The results revealed that harmed versions of both robotic and human-like avatars were imbued with mind to a higher degree, irrespective of the baseline level of mind attributed to their unharmed counterparts. Perceptions of capacity for pain mediated attributions of experience, while both pain and empathy mediated attributions of abilities linked to agency.

Major depression is associated with impaired psychosocial functioning and reduced quality of life. Challenges such as shortage of mental health personnel, long waiting times, perceived stigma, and lower government spends pose barriers to the alleviation of mental health problems. Face-to-face psychotherapy alone provides only point-in-time support and cannot scale quickly enough to address this growing global public health challenge. Artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled, empathetic, and evidence-driven conversational mobile app technologies could play an active role in filling this gap by increasing adoption and enabling reach. Although such a technology can help manage these barriers, they should never replace time with a health care professional for more severe mental health problems. However, app technologies could act as a supplementary or intermediate support system. Mobile mental well-being apps need to uphold privacy and foster both short- and long-term positive outcomes. Objective: This study aimed to present a preliminary real-world data evaluation of the effectiveness and engagement levels of an AI-enabled, empathetic, text-based conversational mobile mental well-being app, Wysa, on users with self-reported symptoms of depression. Methods: In the study, a group of anonymous global users were observed who voluntarily installed the Wysa app, engaged in text-based messaging, and self-reported symptoms of depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. On the basis of the extent of app usage on and between 2 consecutive screening time points, 2 distinct groups of users (high users and low users) emerged. The study used mixed-methods approach to evaluate the impact and engagement levels among these users. The quantitative analysis measured the app impact by comparing the average improvement in symptoms of depression between high and low users. The qualitative analysis measured the app engagement and experience by analyzing in-app user feedback and evaluated the performance of a machine learning classifier to detect user objections during conversations. Results: The average mood improvement (ie, difference in pre- and post-self-reported depression scores) between the groups (ie, high vs low users; n=108 and n=21, respectively) revealed that the high users group had significantly higher average improvement (mean 5.84 [SD 6.66]) compared with the low users group (mean 3.52 [SD 6.15]); Mann-Whitney P=.03 and with a moderate effect size of 0.63. Moreover, 67.7% of user-provided feedback responses found the app experience helpful and encouraging. Conclusions: The real-world data evaluation findings on the effectiveness and engagement levels of Wysa app on users with self-reported symptoms of depression show promise. However, further work is required to validate these initial findings in much larger samples and across longer periods.","2018-11","2021-04-19 15:56:40","2021-04-19 15:56:40","","","","11","6","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 59 WINNERS CIRCLE, TORONTO, ON M4L 3Y7, CANADA Publisher: JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC Type: Article","","","","","artificial intelligence; chatbots; conversational agents; coping skills; depression; emotions; empathy; mental health; mHealth; psychological; resilience","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One of the reasons for its increasing growth is the structural/market-level factors (known as media factors). Although India is a growing technology hub, there have been limited efforts to identify the media multitasking behaviour among the youth in this country. Thus, this study attempts to analyse the prevalence of media multitasking behaviour among the Indian college students and its relationship with their emotions through two methods: self-report and an android-based application known as `Affective Media Landscape Survey' (AMLS). Previous studies have reported that continuous interaction with media diminishes face-to-face interaction, reduces empathy and increases the tendency to live in the virtual world. This raises the concern for emotional differences in everyday life, if any, between the high and low groups of media multitaskers. So the second objective of the study is to understand the emotional profile of the users that varies among media multitasking index. To achieve these objectives, the same two methods, the `self-report' that involves questionnaires and AMLS (an android-based app to study the frequency of media multitasking behaviour and the emotions of the users) have been employed. The study gives an insight into the emerging behavioural patterns and hence is helpful for designing communities to cater to the growing needs of the young media users.","2018-11","2021-04-19 15:56:41","2021-04-19 15:56:41","","197-211","","3","13","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 2455 ℡LER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA Publisher: SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC Type: Article","","","","","Affective media landscape survey; emotions; media factors; media multitasking index","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the speaker-listener scenario, the speaker is always a child, the listener is a human or a toy robot. Two groups of neurotypical children aged 6 years on average composed the population: one Japanese (n = 20) and one French (n = 20). Revealing potential similarities in communicative exchanges in both groups when in contact with a human or a toy robot, the results might signify that emotional empathy requires the implication of an automatic identification. In this sense, emotional empathy might be considered a broad idiosyncrasy, a kind of synchronisation, offering the mind a peculiar form of communication. Our findings seem to be consistent with the assumption that children's brains would be constructed to simulate the feelings of others in order to ensure interpersonal synchronisation.","2018-10-16","2021-04-19 15:56:41","2021-04-19 15:56:41","","","","","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND Publisher: FRONTIERS MEDIA SA Type: Article","","","","","child; emotional empathy; heart rate; interactor robot; synchronisation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Advances in neuroscience, psychology and ethology made it possible to refine the defined functions of empathy to reach a working definition and a model of empathy. Recently, cognitive science and artificial intelligence communities made attempts to model empathy in artificial agents, which can provide means to test these models and hypotheses. A computational model of empathy not only would help to advance the technological artifacts to be more socially compatible, but also understand the empathy mechanisms, test theories, and address the ethics and morality problems the Artificial Intelligence (AI) community is facing today. In this paper, we will review the empathy research from various fields, gather the requirements for empathic capacity and construct a model of empathy that is suitable for interactive conversational agents.","2018-10","2021-04-19 15:56:42","2021-04-19 15:56:42","","20-25","","","26","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS Publisher: ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV Type: Article","","","","","Affective computing; Conversational agents; Empathy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Or, should it show sympathy and empathize with our situation? Although expression of caring and understanding is valued in supportive human communications, do we want the same from a chatbot, or do we simply reject it due to its artificiality and uncanniness? To answer this question, we conducted two experiments with a chatbot providing online medical information advice about a sensitive personal issue. In Study 1, participants (N=158) simply read a dialogue between a chatbot and a human user. In Study 2, participants (N=88) interacted with a real chatbot. We tested the effect of three types of empathic expressionsympathy, cognitive empathy, and affective empathyon individuals' perceptions of the service and the chatbot. Data reveal that expression of sympathy and empathy is favored over unemotional provision of advice, in support of the Computers are Social Actors (CASA) paradigm. This is particularly true for users who are initially skeptical about machines possessing social cognitive capabilities.

Importantly, this neural mirroring is not constant; rather, it is modulated by our beliefs about their intentions, circumstances, and group allegiances. We investigated if the neural empathic response is modulated by minimally-differentiating information (e.g., a simple text label indicating another's religious belief), and if neural activity changes predict ingroups and outgroups across independent paradigms. We found that the empathic response was larger when participants viewed a painful event occurring to a hand labeled with their own religion (ingroup) than to a hand labeled with a different religion (outgroup). Counterintuitively, the magnitude of this bias correlated positively with the magnitude of participants' self-reported empathy. A multivariate classifier, using mean activity in empathy-related brain regions as features, discriminated ingroup from outgroup with 72% accuracy; the classifier's confidence correlated with belief certainty. This classifier generalized successfully to validation experiments in which the ingroup condition was based on an arbitrary group assignment. Empathy networks thus allow for the classification of long-held, newly-modified and arbitrarily-formed ingroups and outgroups. This is the first report of a single machine learning model on neural activation that generalizes to multiple representations of ingroup and outgroup. The current findings may prove useful as an objective diagnostic tool to measure the magnitude of one's group affiliations, and the effectiveness of interventions to reduce ingroup biases.","2018-07-31","2021-04-19 15:56:43","2021-04-19 15:56:43","","","","","12","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND Publisher: FRONTIERS MEDIA SA Type: Article","","","","","affect; empathy; ingroup; machine learning; mind reading; pain; religion; social neuroscience","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A growing number of electroencephalography studies also suggest that it might be useful to assess empathy. The main goal of this study was to use quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) to test whether observation of pain expressed by an avatar (virtual reality) induces a suppression of alpha waves over sensorimotor cortical areas, as it is observed with human stimuli. Not only was it the case, but also the magnitude of alpha suppression was correlated with perspective-taking capacity of participants. Both empathy levels and magnitude of sensorimotor alpha suppression (SAS) were significantly higher in women than men. Interestingly, a significant interaction emerged between levels of individual empathy and specificity of experimental instructions, where SAS in participants with good perspective-taking was higher during passive observation of the distressed avatar, while the opposite was true during an active (trying to understand) condition. These results suggest that: (1) synthetic characters are able to elicit SAS; (2) SAS is indeed associated with perspective-taking capacities; (3) Persons with poorer perspective-taking capacities can show significant SAS when proper instructions are provided. Therefore, qEEG represents a low-cost objective approach to measure perspective-taking abilities.","2018-07-09","2021-04-19 15:56:44","2021-04-19 15:56:44","","","","","12","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND Publisher: FRONTIERS MEDIA SA Type: Article","","","","","alpha suppression; assessment; avatar; electroencephalography; empathy; perspective taking; qEEG","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

If the patient shows decreased performance in a given task, the neurosurgeon will not remove these regions, so as to maintain all brain functions. Objective: The objective of our study was to describe our experience of using a virtual reality (VR) social network during awake craniotomy and discuss its future applications for perioperative mapping of nonverbal language, empathy, and theory of mind. Methods: This was a single-center, prospective, unblinded trial. During wound closure, different VR experiences with a VR headset were proposed to the patient. This project sought to explore interactions with the neuropsychologist's avatar in virtual locations using a VR social network as an available experience. Results: Three patients experienced VR. Despite some limitations due to patient positioning during the operation and the limitation of nonverbal cues inherent to the app, the neuropsychologist, as an avatar, could communicate with the patient and explore gesture communication while wearing a VR headset.

Thus, this study set out to examine social avoidance tendencies and prosocial behaviors towards human controlled (avatars) and computer controlled entities (agents). A total of N = 95 healthy young adults were randomly assigned to an avatar or agent condition. Participants were exposed to a virtual stranger asking to sit at the table (prosocial behavior) as well as a virtual waiter handing over the false drink (social avoidance). Empathy, interaction anxiety, social and physical presence as well as subjective stress levels were assessed to control for confounding influences. Empathy emerged as a significant predictor of prosocial behavior. Social avoidance, in turn, was not predicted by any of the included variables. Also, there was no effect of agency on social presence, physical presence, social interaction anxiety and stress. Yet, participants showed significantly more social avoidance and prosocial behavior towards avatars. These seemingly contradictory results may be explained by an extension of prior theories: While intuitive responses (e.g., stress) follow the Media Equation Concept (Nass & Moon, 2000), more complex processes (e.g., empathy) may modulate agency dependent responses.

For the first time, immersive virtual reality was used to place parents in the position of a child in order to assess impact on perspective-taking and empathy. This novel study was conducted with 20 non-high risk Spanish mothers (a pilot study with 12 mothers is reported in supplementary files). Mothers were virtually embodied as a 4-year-old child, experienced from the first-person perspective and with virtual and real body movements synchronised. They interacted with a `mother avatar', which responded either in a Positive or Negative way. Participants reported a strong body ownership illusion for the child body that led to cognitive, emotional and physical reactions. Experiencing negative maternal behavior increased levels of empathy. In addition, the Negative mother led to increased feelings of fear of violence. Physiological data indicated greater stress in the Negative than Positive condition. Although further research is required to assess the effectiveness of such methods, any improvement in empathy that leads to a change in parenting behavior has the potential to impact on developmental outcomes for children.","2018-02-14","2021-04-19 15:56:46","2021-04-19 15:56:46","","","","","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND Publisher: NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In a user study, two conditions are implemented with or without explicit emotional adaptation of NAO to the human user in a between-subjects design. Evaluations of user experience and acceptance are conducted based on evaluated measures of human-robot interaction (HRI). The results of the user study reveal a significant increase of helpfulness (number of named objects), anthropomorphism, and empathy in the explicit emotional adaptation condition even without social cues of facial Action Units, but only in case of prior robot contact of the test persons. Otherwise, an opposite effect is found. These findings suggest, that reduction of these social cues can be overcome by robot experience prior to the interaction task, e.g. realizable by an additional bonding phase, confirming the importance of such from previous work.

For this experiment, empathy is expressed only by adding appropriate emotions to the words in speech. Also, humans' preferences for a robot interacting with empathetic speech versus a standard robotic voice are also assessed. The results show that humans are able to perceive empathy and emotions in robot speech, and prefer it over the standard robotic voice. It is important for the emotions in empathetic speech to be consistent with the language content of what is being said, and with the human users' emotional state.

Despite significant progress towards the development of empathic social agents, current social robots have yet to reach the full emotional and social capabilities. This paper presents our recent effort on incorporating an automated Facial Expression Recognition (FER) system based on deep neural networks into the spoken dialog of a social robot (Ryan) to extend and enrich its capabilities beyond spoken dialog and integrate the user's affect state into the robot's responses. In order to evaluate whether this incorporation can improve social capabilities of Ryan, we conducted a series of Human-Robot-Interaction (HRI) experiments. In these experiments the subjects watched some videos and Ryan engaged them in a conversation driven by user's facial expressions perceived by the robot. We measured the accuracy of the automated FER system on the robot when interacting with different human subjects as well as three social/interactive aspects, namely task engagement, empathy, and likability of the robot. The results of our HRI study indicate that the subjects rated empathy and likability of the affect-aware Ryan significantly higher than non-empathic (the control condition) Ryan. Interestingly, we found that the accuracy of the FER system is not a limiting factor, as subjects rated the affect-aware agent equipped with a low accuracy FER system as empathic and likable as when facial expression was recognized by a human observer.","2018","2021-04-19 15:56:47","2021-04-19 15:56:47","","783-789","","","","","","","IEEE RO-MAN","","","","IEEE","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: IEEE; IEEE Robot & Automat Soc; Robot Soc Japan; Korea Robot Soc; Nanjing Forestry Univ ISSN: 1944-9445 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>27th IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (IEEE RO-MAN), Nanjing, PEOPLES R CHINA, AUG 27-31, 2018</p>","","","","","Cabibihan, JJ and Mastrogiovanni, F and Pandey, AK and Rossi, S and Staffa, M","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As relationships extend over long periods of time, sustained empathic behavior towards robots would be of interest. In order to measure user actions that may vary over time and are affected by empathy towards a robot teammate, we created the TEAMMATE simulation system.

This agent is now enhanced using a body language called “unazuki” in Japanese, a kind of nodding to greatly promote dialogue, often accompanying “un-un” (meaning “exactly”) of Japanese onomatopoeia. This body language significantly helps represent empathy or entire approval. Our agent is enhanced with such dialog promotion nodding robot to continue the conversation naturally or context respectfully towards clients' further reflection. To realize it, the robot nods twice at each end of dialog sentence input by clients. Here, we introduce a robot that behaves human-like by an appropriate nodding behavior. The motivation for such a more human-like robot was the extension of application fields from IT workers' counselling to people, who suffer from more social problems such as financial debt, or anxiety of victory or defeat. For such applications, it is important that the agent behaves as much as possible human-like. Here, we present an enhanced experimental evaluation.

Dick's empathy box from his novel Do Androids Dream of Electronic Sheep? [3]. In the novel, thousands of people were anonymously connected with each other both haptically and emotionally when they grabbed the handles of their empathy boxes. The Empathy Amulet similarly networks a group of strangers together through shared experiences of physical warmth. It is not yet another technology for staying in touch with people you already know (and falling short). Rather, it encourages its wearer to make a deliberate and generous choice to invest their time and energy in connection with strangers, and it incorporates reciprocity into its design, such that helping oneself means helping other people. In today's world, people are less likely to feel empathy towards those not in their immediate network of family and friends, and, despite a proliferation of connective technologies, loneliness is on the rise [2, 5]. Surprisingly, it is the perceived sense of loneliness, and not actually being physically alone that has numerous health consequences for a significant portion of the population. Lakoff and Johnson's theory of embodied mind asserts that our physical and subjective experiences are inextricably linked, and the Empathy Amulet leverages the powerful connection between the physical experience of warmth and the subjective experience of social connectedness to combat loneliness and cultivate a stronger sense of connection with strangers [1, 4].","2018","2021-04-19 15:56:50","2021-04-19 15:56:50","","248-253","","","","","","","","","","","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: Assoc Comp Machinery; ACM SIGCHI; ACM SIGMOBILE; NOKIA Bell Labs; Intel; Microsoft; NAVER Lab; HUAWEI; Singapore Tourism Board; SG Singapore Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>ACM International Symposium on Wearable Computers, Google, Singapore, SINGAPORE, OCT 08-12, 2018</p>","","","","Embodied cognition; haptic I/O; internet of things; prototyping; wearable electronics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DICK'S “DO ANDROIDS DREAM OF ELECTRIC SHEEP?”","NOVYI FILOLOGICHESKII VESTNIK-NEW PHILOLOGICAL BULLETIN","","2072-9316","","","Written in 1968, the sci-fi novel by the American author Philip K. Dick “Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?” still retains the interest of the wide reading audience. The paper aims at elaborating upon the reasons for this lasting public enthusiasm which is claimed to relate not only to extremely successful film-versions of the book, but, even more so, to the highly topical message of the novel. In his antiutopian text, Philip K. Dick manages to put into focus the whole range of issues curraently associated with posthumanism. These are environmental problems caused by human activities, interplanet colonization escalating the conflicts of inclusion / exclusion, human / animal relations overlapping with the hybridization of natural and artificial, critical problems of future technological posthumanism manifesting themselves in highly problematic distinction between the humans and androids and in questioning the ontoethical status of the humans Philip K. Dick explores philosophical and social underpinnings of the catastrophic future which lies in wait for humanity and seems to strongly adhere to such humanistic values as empathy (the main touchstone to differentiate between humans and androids), self-reflection (the predominant feature of the protagonist Rick Deckard), search for identity and for meaning as the principal vectors of the human life, mercy for the mentally handicapped. Philip K. Dick's book can be viewed as one of the earliest caveats of the emerging trend to reconsider humanness in the sociocultural context of rapidly developing technology, various environmental threats, all kinds of hybridization and their ethical repercussions - and as such can be seen as truly prognostic, the most valuable part of it to be found in its ethical and social awareness and highly conscious refusal to suggest any final answer: essentially, the titled question seems eristically unanswerable.","2018","2021-04-19 15:56:50","2021-04-19 15:56:50","","197-207","","47","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: MIUSSKAYA SQ 6, MOSCOW GSP-3, 125993, RUSSIA Publisher: RUSSIAN STATE UNIV HUMANITIES Type: Article","","","","","(post)humanism; anti-utopia; empathy; historicism; humanness; ideology; Philip K.

Educators recognise that effective and active approaches to teaching are more closely associated with deeper learning. These active approaches aim to develop higher order skills, encouraging learners' critical thinking and decision-making as well as enhancing their capacity to be agile, flexible and adaptable. Among those active approaches stand serious games, which are powerful learning environments that are seen as an emergent and engaging new way of experiment situations and construct knowledge. Serious games, in the form of role-play simulations, are scenario-based games that are used to simulate real life situations. Although serious games and simulations have been widely used in serving educational purposes, there is little evidence on their use in achieving deeper learning. In addition, there is lack of guidelines or a framework for designing serious games to support learners achieve deep learning. This paper proposes a theoretical framework, based on Bloom's educational model for Mastery Learning, which illustrates the design of instructional process adapted for serious games using empathy and creativity as an approach of designing serious games for achieving deeper learning. It describes an approach of evaluating this framework by designing a serious game focusing on raising awareness about domestic violence and abuse.","2018","2021-04-19 15:56:50","2021-04-19 15:56:50","","785-791","","","","","","","Proceedings of the European Conference on Games-Based Learning","","","","ACAD CONFERENCES LTD","CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND","English","","","","","","","ISSN: 2049-0992 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>12th European Conference on Games Based Learning (ECGBL), SKEMA Business Sch, FRANCE, OCT 04-05, 2018</p>","","","","creativity; deeper learning; empathy; formative assessment; role-play simulations; serious games","Ciussi, M","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In fact, not only is it becoming apparent that quantum processes may regularly take place in biological systems, but these processes may underlie the mechanisms of consciousness and propel our models of conceptualizing the human brain into the next era of scientific understanding. The phenomena of consciousness have allured scientists and philosophers for thousands of years, while a precise technical understanding has remained elusive. If possible, developing this understanding will likely be one of humanity's greatest achievements. Knowing the fundamental processes that create conscious experience has far-reaching implications, from the potential birth of true artificial intelligence to a better understanding of mental health disorder etiologies and treatments. One major challenge in the mental health professions, and, ultimately, in empathy of any kind, is being able to see from and appreciate another person's unique, subjective experience.

That is, the agent learns the person's facial expression by using Self Organizing Map, and gives it a meaning by mapping the perceived expression into its internal state diagram.

Similar to our previous paper, this approach is inspired by social and emotional development of infants interacting with their parents who have a certain cultural background. Social referencing occurs when infants perceive their parents' facial expressions and vocal tones of emotional situations to form their own interpretation. On the other hand, this model replaces the batch learning self-organizing map with the dynamic cell structure, incrementally training a neural network model with a variety of emotional behaviors obtained from the users with whom the robot interacts. We demonstrate the validity of our incremental learning model through a public human action dataset, which will facilitate the acquisition of emotional body expression of socially assistive robots as a reflection of the individual user's culture.","2018","2021-04-19 15:56:51","2021-04-19 15:56:51","","377-382","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","English","","","","","","","Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>15th International Conference on Ubiquitous Robots (UR), Honolulu, HI, JUN 26-30, 2018</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, we could not provide feedback to cyberspace regarding the place, time, and target of a user realizing friendship since there is no technique for conveniently measuring the evocation of friendship during offline events. In this research, we propose a method of estimating the evocation of friendship using the similarity in the pulse rate variabilities (PRVs) of users when empathy is evoked between them. The user can be made aware of friendship estimated automatically through machine learning by wearing a wristwatch-type pulsimeter. CFs are more likely to evoke empathy than superficial friendships (SFs). To demonstrate the usefulness of this method, we conducted an experiment assuming an event where a group of four people are enjoying their time in an amusement park. From the experimental results, we showed that the similarity of the PRVs in CFs is greater than that in SFs when the favorability rating is high and the users like each other. Moreover, we showed that the proposed method estimated the evocation of friendship during the attraction experience with anf-measure of 0.74 at maximum and during an offline event with a mean f-measure of 0.78. The results showed the usefulness and effectiveness of this method.","2018","2021-04-19 15:56:51","2021-04-19 15:56:51","","1407-1426","","7","30","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 1-23-3-303 SENDAGI, TOKYO, 113-0022, JAPAN Publisher: MYU, SCIENTIFIC PUBLISHING DIVISION Type: Article","","","","","favorability; friendship; machine learning; similarity of pulse rate variability of users","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Un-fortunately, many people cannot live with animals because of allergies, infection risk, or risk of damage to rental housing. To address these problems, some research groups have investigated robot-based psychotherapy. However, the important healing elements for therapy robots were not identified. Therefore, we conducted an Internet survey to determine the design elements of such a robot that might engender a healing mood and the functions that should be implemented. We assumed that a healing mood could be induced based on the interactive functions and appearance. To verify this hypothesis, we developed and evaluated a new interactive therapy robot. Next, we conducted interviews with individuals who interacted with a prototype therapy robot. The interviews revealed that the appearance of the robot was critical to engendering feelings of healing, comfort, and empathy. In addition, the size, softness, and comfort of the interactive therapy robot contributed to people feeling affection towards it. We also confirmed the importance of the robot appearing to listen to those who interacted with it. Our results should be useful for designing companion robots for therapy purposes.","2018","2021-04-19 15:56:52","2021-04-19 15:56:52","","66-83","","","10714","","","","Lecture Notes in Computer Science","","","","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: Multimodal Technologies & Interact Journal ISSN: 0302-9743 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>14th International Conference on Advances in Computer Entertainment Technology (ACE), London, ENGLAND, DEC 14-16, 2017</p>","","","","Healing elements Therapeutic robots designed to communicate with humans; Therapeutic effect","Cheok, AD and Inami, M and Romao, T","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this situation, robots will require sophisticated capabilities, such as the ability to recognize human pain in advance and generate counter-responses as follow up emphatic action. Hence, it is important for robots to acquire an appropriate pain concept that allows them to develop these capabilities. This paper conceptualizes empathy generation through the realization of synthetic pain classes integrated into a robot's self-awareness framework, and the implementation of fault detection on the robot body serves as a primary source of pain activation. Projection of human shoulder motion into the robot arm motion acts as a fusion process, which is used as a medium to gather information for analyses then to generate corresponding synthetic pain and emphatic responses. An experiment is designed to mirror a human peer's shoulder motion into an observer robot. The results demonstrate that the fusion takes place accurately whenever unified internal states are achieved, allowing accurate classification of synthetic pain categories and generation of empathy responses in a timely fashion. Future works will consider a pain activation mechanism development.","2018","2021-04-19 15:56:53","2021-04-19 15:56:53","","56-73","","1","5","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: PO BOX 2604, SPRINGFIELD, MO 65801-2604 USA Publisher: AMER INST MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES-AIMS Type: Article","","","","","assistive robots; cognitive; empathic reaction; joint position; shoulder motion; synthetic pain","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This principle has been shown to be effective in games between humans and between humans and computer agents. We compared the social and cognitive engagement of children when playing checkers game combined with a social strategy against a robot or against a computer. We found that by combining the social and game strategy the children (average age of 8.3 years) had more empathy and social engagement with the robot since the children did not want to necessarily win against it. This finding is promising for using social strategies for the creation of long-term relations between robots and children and making educational tasks more engaging. An additional outcome of the study was the significant difference in the perception of the children about the difficulty of the game - the game with the robot was seen as more challenging and the robot - as a smarter opponent. This finding might be due to the higher perceived or expected intelligence from the robot, or because of the higher complexity of seeing patterns in three-dimensional world.","2018","2021-04-19 15:56:53","2021-04-19 15:56:53","","81-98","","1, SI","30","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND Publisher: TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD Type: Article","","","","","combining social and game strategy; Economic game strategies for robots; engagement robot/computer; long-term relations with robots","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, a Microsoft Kinect is used to track the player's skeleton and represent it as an avatar in the virtual environment while the HTC Vive is used for head tracking and virtual reality visualization. Multiple avatar positioning modes are trialled and discussed via a small self-reflective study (with the authors as participants) to examine their ability to allow accurate stepping motions, maintain physical comfort, and encourage self-identification or empathy with the avatar. While this is just an initial study, it highlights promising opportunities for designing engaging step training games with this integrated interface but also highlights its limitations, especially in the context of an unsupervised exercise program of older people in independent living situations.","2018","2021-04-19 15:56:53","2021-04-19 15:56:53","","","","","","","","","IEEE International Conference on Serious Games and Applications for Health","","","","IEEE","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: IEEE ISSN: 2330-5649 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>IEEE 6th International Conference on Serious Games and Applications for Health (SeGAH), Vienna, AUSTRIA, MAY 16-18, 2018</p>","","","","","Vilaca, JL and Grechenig, T and Duque, D and Rodrigues, N and Dias, N","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In order to provide a natural interaction experience, these social robots need to recognise the emotions expressed by the users across various modalities of communication and use them to estimate an internal affective model of the interaction. These internal emotions act as motivation for learning to respond to the user in different situations, using the physical capabilities of the robot. This paper proposes a deep hybrid neural model for multi-modal affect recognition, analysis and behaviour modelling in social robots. The model uses growing self-organising network models to encode intrinsic affective states for the robot. These intrinsic states are used to train a reinforcement learning model to learn facial expression representations on the Neuro-Inspired Companion (NICO) robot, enabling the robot to express empathy towards the users.","2018","2021-04-19 15:56:54","2021-04-19 15:56:54","","","","","","","","","IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","","","","IEEE","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","English","","","","","","","ISSN: 2161-4393 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN), Rio de Janeiro, BRAZIL, JUL 08-13, 2018</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As people interact more often with voice and gesture controlled machines, they expect the machines to recognize different emotions, and understand other high level communication features such as humor, sarcasm and intention. In order to make such communication possible, the machines need an empathy module in them, which is a software system that can extract emotions from human speech and behavior and can decide the correct response of the robot. Although research on empathetic robots is still in the primary stage, current methods involve using signal processing techniques, sentiment analysis and machine learning algorithms to make robots that can `understand' human emotion. Other aspects of human-robot interaction include facial expression and gesture recognition, as well as robot movement to convey emotion and intent. We propose Zara the Supergirl as a prototype system of empathetic robots. It is a software-based virtual android, with an animated cartoon character to present itself on the screen. She will get `smarter' and more empathetic, by having machine learning algorithms, and gathering more data and learning from it. In this paper, we present our work so far in the areas of deep learning of emotion and sentiment recognition, as well as humor recognition. We hope to explore the future direction of android development and how it can help improve people's lives.","2018","2021-04-19 15:56:56","2021-04-19 15:56:56","","173-193","","","9624","","","","Lecture Notes in Computer Science","","","","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","English","","","","","","","ISSN: 0302-9743 Issue: II Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>17th International Conference on Intelligent Text Processing and Computational Linguistics (CICLing), Mevlana Univ, Konya, TURKEY, APR 03-09, 2016</p>","","","","","Gelbukh, A","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Formative assessment (FA) has emerged to be one of the efficient tools in the development of the above-mentioned competences and thus a topical issue in today's education. A number of studies have produced positive results investigating the use of formative assessment on the development of learner metacognitive and affective skills, student responsibility, active self-regulated learning, viewing learning as a goal rather than an outcome (Anderson, M., 2016; Brookhart, 2009; Chappuis, J., 2016; Fisher & Frey, 2014; [13]). The present study intends to examine the application of formative assessment in language classes at a higher education institution whose mission is to educate citizens for our society through commitment to liberal arts and sciences education. It aims at investigating how the application of formative assessment assists in fostering deep learning, student-centered approach, collaborative and tension free environment, active learning in small groups, enhanced dynamic exchange of feedback between teachers and students as well as self-assessment and peer-assessment both in traditional classroom as well as in virtual learning environment. It also explores the impact of formative assessment upon student lifelong learning skill development. Methodologically, the study is based on an opinion survey, reflection and class observation performed with 181 university students and 21 language teachers. The study has revealed that formative assessment adds significant value to the learning and teaching of languages. It settles very well in the education process based on liberal arts and sciences grounded in the principles of collegiality, cooperative learning, connection-building among all members of the learning and teaching process including students and teachers. It has also shown that the broad possibilities for the successful exploitation of formative assessment in language education are still in need of further in-depth research.","2018","2021-04-19 15:56:56","2021-04-19 15:56:56","","10084-10091","","","","","","","EDULEARN Proceedings","","","","IATED-INT ASSOC TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION & DEVELOPMENT","LAURI VOLPI 6, VALENICA, BURJASSOT 46100, SPAIN","English","","","","","","","ISSN: 2340-1117 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>10th International Conference on Education and New Learning Technologies (EDULEARN), Palma, SPAIN, JUL 02-04, 2018</p>","","","","foreign language learning and teaching; Formative assessment; student-centered approach; tertiary education","Chova, LG and Martinez, AL and Torres, IC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of this study is to compare two models describing social-emotional behavior, one of which is based on a traditional machine learning algorithm, and the other on a cognitive architecture supporting social emotionality. It is hypothesized that the second model will be more efficient in eliciting user's empathy to a virtual cobot based on this model. Here the object of study is a virtual pet: a penguin. Two models controlling the pet were compared: a reinforcement learning model (a Q-learning algorithm) and the emotional cognitive architecture eBICA (Samsonovich, 2013). The second approach was based on a semantic map of pet's emotional states, that was constructed based on the human ranking. It is found that the eBICA model scores higher in participant's empathy compared to the model based on reinforcement learning. This article compares strengths and weaknesses of both methods. In conclusion, the findings indicate advantages of the approach based on eBICA compared to more traditional techniques. Results will have broad implications for building intelligent social agents.

This study performs an experiment in WOZ environment in which different subjects (n=17) interacting with the same robot while they believe that the robot is a different robot, up to three versions.

The behavior that would induce human-like feelings after long exposures is difficult to determine, and it often depends on the cultural background of the observers. Therefore, in this study, we generate an acting performance system for the android, in which an android and a human interact in a stage play in the real world. We adopt the theatrical theory called Contemporary Colloquial Theatre Theory to give the android natural behaviors so that audiences can comfortably observe it even after long-minute exposure. A stage play is created and shown in various locations, and the audiences are requested to report their impressions of the stage and their cultural and psychological backgrounds in a self-evaluating questionnaire. Overall analysis indicates that the audience had positive feelings, in terms of attractiveness, towards the android on the stage even after 20 min of exposure. The singularly high acceptance of the android by Japanese audiences seems to be correlated with a high animism tendency, rather than to empathy. We also discuss how the stage play approach is limited and could be extended to contribute to realization of human-robot interaction in the real world.","2017-12","2021-04-19 15:56:58","2021-04-19 15:56:58","","","","4","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND Publisher: MDPI AG Type: Article","","","","","android theatre; contemporary colloquial theatre theory; robot theatre; social robots","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These claims are based on a moderated mediation model. They reported a three-way interaction between game condition, gender, and avatar identification when predicting masculine ideology in their original study. Masculine ideology was associated, in turn, with decreased empathy. However, there were no main experimental effects for video game condition on empathy. The current analysis considers the strength of the evidence for claims made in the original study on a sample of 153 adolescents (M (age) = 16.812, SD = 1.241; 44.2% male). We confirmed that there was little evidence for an overall effect of game condition on empathy toward girls or women. We tested the robustness of the original reported moderated mediation models against other, theoretically derived alternatives, and found that effects differed based on how variables were measured (using alternatives in their public data file) and the statistical model used. The experimental groups differed significantly and substantially in terms of age suggesting that there might have been issues with the procedures used to randomly assign participants to conditions. These results highlight the need for preregistration of experimental protocols in video game research and raise some concerns about how moderated mediation models are used to support causal inferences. These results call into question whether use of “sexist” video games is a causal factor in the development of reduced empathy toward girls and women among adolescents.","2017-12","2021-04-19 15:56:59","2021-04-19 15:56:59","","2446-2459","","12","46","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA Publisher: SPRINGER/PLENUM PUBLISHERS Type: Article","","","","","Empathy; Masculinity; Sexism; Video games; Violence","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet an even more controversial practice could be on the horizon, which is allowing a robot to “nudge” a user's behavior for the good of society. In this article, we examine the feasibility of creating companion robots that would seek to nurture a user's empathy toward other human beings. As more and more computing devices subtly and overtly influence human behavior, it is important to draw attention to whether it would be ethically appropriate for roboticists to pursue this type of design pathway. Our primary focus is on whether a companion robot could encourage humans to perform charitable acts; this design possibility illustrates the range of socially just actions that a robot could potentially elicit from a user and what the associated ethical concerns may be.","2017-11","2021-04-19 15:56:59","2021-04-19 15:56:59","","499-507","","4","32","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article","","","","","Charity; Companion robots; Design ethics; Empathy; Nudges; Robot ethics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Seeing mind in others is not exclusive to human agents, but mind can also be ascribed to non-human agents like robots, as long as their appearance and/or behavior allows them to be perceived as intentional beings. Previous studies have shown that human appearance and reliable behavior induce mind perception to robot agents, and positively affect attitudes and performance in human-robot interaction. What has not been investigated so far is whether different triggers of mind perception have an independent or interactive effect on attitudes and performance in human-robot interaction. We examine this question by manipulating agent appearance (human vs. robot) and behavior (reliable vs. random) within the same paradigm and examine how congruent (human/reliable vs. robot/random) versus incongruent (human/random vs. robot/reliable) combinations of these triggers affect performance (i.e., gaze following) and attitudes (i.e., agent ratings) in human-robot interaction. The results show that both appearance and behavior affect human-robot interaction but that the two triggers seem to operate in isolation, with appearance more strongly impacting attitudes, and behavior more strongly affecting performance. The implications of these findings for human-robot interaction are discussed.","2017-08-23","2021-04-19 15:57:00","2021-04-19 15:57:00","","","","","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND Publisher: FRONTIERS MEDIA SA Type: Article","","","","","human-robot interaction; intentionality; mind perception; social cognition; social robotics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the future, we may face a different but related problem: that we might create (or cause the creation of) beings that not only satisfy but exceed these criteria. The question becomes whether these are minimal criteria, or hierarchical, such that those who fulfill them to greater degree should be afforded greater consideration. This article questions the validity and necessity of drawing divisions among beings that satisfy the minimum requirements for personhood; considering how future beings-intelligent androids, synthezoids, even alternate-substrate sentiences-might fit alongside the “baseline” human. I ask whether these alternate beings ought to be considered different to us, and why this may or may not matter in terms of a notion of “human community.” The film Blade Runner, concerned in large part with humanity and its key synthezoid antagonist Roy Batty, forms a framing touchstone for my discussion. Batty is stronger, faster, more resilient, and more intelligent than Homo sapiens. His exploits, far beyond the capability of normal humans, are contrasted with his frailty and transient lifespan, his aesthetic appreciation of the sights he has seen, and his burgeoning empathy. Not for nothing does his creator within the mythos term him “more human than human.”","2017-07","2021-04-19 15:57:00","2021-04-19 15:57:00","","476-490","","3","26","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA Publisher: CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS Type: Article","","","","","artificial intelligence; enhancement; humanity; novel beings; personhood; posthuman","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, RAT using humanoid robots is still a novel practice for which the adhesion mechanisms, indications and benefits remain unclear. Also, little is known about how the robot's behavioral and affective style might promote engagement of persons with dementia (PwD) in RAT. The present study sought to investigate the use of a humanoid robot in a psychomotor therapy for PwD. We examined the robot's potential to engage participants in the intervention and its effect on their emotional state. A brief psychomotor therapy program involving the robot as the therapist's assistant was created. For this purpose, a corpus of social and physical behaviors for the robot and a “control software” for customizing the program and operating the robot were also designed. Particular attention was given to components of the RAT that could promote participant's engagement (robot's interaction style, personalization of contents). In the pilot assessment of the intervention nine PwD (7 women and 2 men, M age = 86 y/o) hospitalized in a geriatrics unit participated in four individual therapy sessions: one classic therapy (CT) session (patient-therapist) and three RAT sessions (patient-therapist-robot). Outcome criteria for the evaluation of the intervention included: participant's engagement, emotional state and well-being; satisfaction of the intervention, appreciation of the robot, and empathy-related behaviors in human-robot interaction (HRI). Results showed a high constructive engagement in both CT and RAT sessions. More positive emotional responses in participants were observed in RAT compared to CT. RAT sessions were better appreciated than CT sessions. The use of a social robot as a mediating tool appeared to promote the involvement of PwD in the therapeutic intervention increasing their immediate wellbeing and satisfaction.","2017-06-30","2021-04-19 15:57:00","2021-04-19 15:57:00","","","","","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND Publisher: FRONTIERS MEDIA SA Type: Article","","","","","control software; dementia; engagement; geriatrics; psychomotor therapy; social robots","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We compared self-report ratings of the multidimensional scale of PSS (MSPSS) among age-and IQ-matched groups of adults (18-58 years) with cognitively high-functioning ASD (N=41), or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; N=69), and neurotypical controls (NC; N=69). Accompanying group comparisons, we used machine learning random forest (RF) analyses to explore predictors among a range of psychopathological and socio-emotional variables.

Across ASD and ADHD, interindividual differences in autism severity, affective empathy, symptoms of anxiety related to social interactions, hyperactivity/impulsivity, and somatization best predicted MSPSS-f. These relationships did not differ between clinical groups. While group comparisons demonstrated greater impairment in individuals with ASD, analyzing individuals' characteristics revealed cross-diagnoses similarities in regard to their MSPSS-f relationships.

Objective: The aim of this study was to find technological solutions that meet the needs of mothers during the year following childbirth. Methods: Two co-creation workshops were undertaken with parents and professionals. The aim of the first workshop was to create a list of all the criteria the proposed solution would have to address to meet the needs of mothers after childbirth. The aim of the second workshop was to create solutions in response to the criteria selected during the first workshop. Results: Parents and health professionals want solutions that include empathy (ie, to help fight against the feelings of abnormality and loneliness), that help mothers in daily life, that are personalized and adapted to different situations, that are educational, and that assures some continuity in their contact with health professionals. In practice, we found that parents and professionals think the solution should be accessible to everyone and available at all times. To address these criteria, technology experts proposed different solutions, such as a forum dedicated to the postpartum period that is supervised by professionals, a centralized website, a system of videoconferencing, an online exchange group, a “gift voucher” system, a virtual reality app, or a companion robot. Conclusions: The human component seems to be very important during the postnatal period. Nevertheless, technology could be a great ally in helping mothers during the postpartum period. Technology can help reliably inform parents and may also give them the right tools to find supportive people. However, these technologies should be tested in clinical trials.","2017-05","2021-04-19 15:57:01","2021-04-19 15:57:01","","","","5","6","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 59 WINNERS CIRCLE, TORONTO, ON M4L 3Y7, CANADA Publisher: JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC Type: Article","","","","","co-creating workshop; co-creation; mothers' needs; postpartum needs; technological solutions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, these computer-delivered interventions rely on mouse, keyboard, or touchscreen responses for interactions between the users and the computer-delivered intervention. The principles of motivational interviewing suggest that in-person interventions may be effective, in part, because they encourage individuals to think through and speak aloud their motivations for changing a health behavior, which current computer-delivered interventions do not allow. Objective: The objective of this study was to take the initial steps toward development of a voice-based computer-delivered intervention that can ask open-ended questions and respond appropriately to users' verbal responses, more closely mirroring a human-delivered motivational intervention. Methods: We developed (1) a voice-based computer-delivered intervention that was run by a human controller and that allowed participants to speak their responses to scripted prompts delivered by speech generation software and (2) a text-based computer-delivered intervention that relied on the mouse, keyboard, and computer screen for all interactions. We randomized 60 heavy drinking college students to interact with the voice-based computer-delivered intervention and 30 to interact with the text-based computer-delivered intervention and compared their ratings of the systems as well as their motivation to change drinking and their drinking behavior at 1-month follow-up. Results: Participants reported that the voice-based computer-delivered intervention engaged positively with them in the session and delivered content in a manner consistent with motivational interviewing principles. At 1-month follow-up, participants in the voice-based computer-delivered intervention condition reported significant decreases in quantity, frequency, and problems associated with drinking, and increased perceived importance of changing drinking behaviors. In comparison to the text-based computer-delivered intervention condition, those assigned to voice-based computer-delivered intervention reported significantly fewer alcohol-related problems at the 1-month follow-up (incident rate ratio 0.60, 95% CI 0.44-0.83, P=.002). The conditions did not differ significantly on perceived importance of changing drinking or on measures of drinking quantity and frequency of heavy drinking. Conclusions: Results indicate that it is feasible to construct a series of open-ended questions and a bank of responses and follow-up prompts that can be used in a future fully automated voice-based computer-delivered intervention that may mirror more closely human-delivered motivational interventions to reduce drinking. Such efforts will require using advanced speech recognition capabilities and machine-learning approaches to train a program to mirror the decisions made by human controllers in the voice-based computer-delivered intervention used in this study. In addition, future studies should examine enhancements that can increase the perceived warmth and empathy of voice-based computer-delivered intervention, possibly through greater personalization, improvements in the speech generation software, and embodying the computer-delivered intervention in a physical form.","2017-06","2021-04-19 15:57:01","2021-04-19 15:57:01","","","","2","4","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 130 QUEENS QUAY E, STE 1102, TORONTO, ON M5A 0P6, CANADA Publisher: JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC Type: Article","","","","","alcohol intervention; Computer-delivered intervention; heavy drinking; voice-based systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The existence of an implicit mentalizing system has generated considerable debate however, centered on the ability of various experimental paradigms to demonstrate unambiguously such mentalizing. Evidence for implicit mentalizing has previously been provided by the `dot perspective task,' where participants are slower to verify the number of dots they can see when an avatar can see a different number of dots. However, recent evidence challenged a mentalizing interpretation of this effect by showing it was unaltered when the avatar was replaced with an inanimate arrow stimulus. Here we present an extension of the dot perspective task using an invisibility cloaking device to render the dots invisible on certain trials. This paradigm is capable of providing unambiguous evidence of automatic mentalizing, but no such evidence was found. Two further well-powered experiments used opaque and transparent goggles to manipulate visibility but found no evidence of automatic mentalizing, nor of individual differences in empathy or perspective-taking predicting performance, contradicting previous studies using the same design. The results cast doubt on the existence of an implicit mentalizing system, suggesting that previous effects were due to domain-general processes.","2017-03","2021-04-19 15:57:02","2021-04-19 15:57:02","","454-465","","3","43","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA Publisher: AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC Type: Article","","","","","domain-general processing; implicit mentalizing; submentalizing; theory of mind; visual perspective taking","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It should also try to establish a social empathic relation with the user. To this aim, it is crucial to endow the robot with the capability of recognizing the user's affective state and reason on it for triggering the most appropriate communicative behavior. In this paper we describe how such an affective reasoning has been implemented in the NAO robot for simulating empathic behaviors in the context of AAL. In particular, the robot is able to recognize the emotion of the user by analyzing communicative signals extracted from speech and facial expressions. The recognized emotion allows triggering the robot's affective state and, consequently, the most appropriate empathic behavior. The robot's empathic behaviors have been evaluated both by experts in communication and through a user study aimed at assessing the perception and interpretation of empathy by elderly users. Results are quite satisfactory and encourage us to further extend the social and affective capabilities of the robot.","2017-02","2021-04-19 15:57:02","2021-04-19 15:57:02","","5073-5094","","4","76","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article","","","","","Affective computing; Empathy; Social assistive robots","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The main motivation for developing a more human-like robot was the extension of application fields from IT workers' counselling to people, who suffers from more social problems such as financial debt, or anxiety of victory or defeat. For such applications, it is often very important that the agent behaves as much as possible human-like.

As the breath of robots applications requiring human interaction grow, it is important for robots to acquire sophisticated social skills such as empathy towards pain. However, it turns out that this is difficult to achieve without having an appropriate concept of pain that relies on robots being aware of their own body machinery aspects. This paper introduces the concept of pain, based on the ability to develop a state of awareness of robots own body and the use of the fault detection approach to generate artificial robot pain. Faults provide the stimulus and defines a classified magnitude value, which constitutes artificial pain generation, comprised of synthetic pain classes. Our experiment evaluates some of synthetic pain classes and the results show that the robot gains awareness of its internal state through its ability to predict its joint motion and generate appropriate artificial pain.

A model of empathy in engineering as a core skill, as a practice orientation and a professional way of being that can be taught in university programs has been proposed [1]. Does an emotional intelligence model of empathy need to be taught earlier than at the university level? The engineering design process has been included in the science standards for k-12 schools since 2013[2]. One of the purposes of this inclusion is the ability to reach a diverse population of students by applying real world problems in their curriculum. The design process typically includes the steps of defining the engineering problem, developing solutions and optimizing the design. Although the word “empathy” is not used, these problems are defined from an empathetic perspective as “situations people want to change” of “social and global significance.” However, the standards do not discuss how to define a problem or how to teach empathy. In the winter of 2016 a study was conducted to evaluate the influence of empathy based lessons on girls' interest in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). Some information is known about empathy in lessons. Girls may be more interested if lessons are altered to include an element of caring [3]. Other studies indicate children's empathy increases with type of media provided in lesson (computer versus robot) [4]. The study in this article was a qualitative case study of 50 children, grades 6, 7, and 8, boys and girls in an after-school 4-H Science Club. The lessons were conducted once per week. The lessons were previously conducted in an all-girls after-school STEM program with similar available inexpensive materials. Both schools had similar demographics. The students and coordinators(instructors) were observed, pre- and post-surveys were conducted, and interviews of both students and coordinators were audio and/or video-taped. Although responses varied by lesson, initial results indicate many students and coordinators did not understand the meaning of empathy situated in engineering design.","2017","2021-04-19 15:57:05","2021-04-19 15:57:05","","","","","","","","","Frontiers in Education Conference","","","","IEEE","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: IEEE; IEEE ASEE; IEEE Comp Soc; Indian ISSN: 0190-5848 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE), Indianapolis, IN, OCT 18-21, 2017</p>","","","","after-school science club; design process; empathy; engineering; middle school","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A transformer set-up forms the central element in transmitting and distributing power. There is heavy transmission loss if the power system is defective. The transformers should be protected from internal faults and magnetic inrush currents. The power demands for a biomedical research center or hospital are higher and need to be consistent for the working of all biomedical equipments used. This paper proposes transient detection techniques using Wavelet transform (WT). The advantage of WT is that, it can represent current and voltage signals. Empathy of transients is very fast and precise so this work tends to elaborate on a new wavelet method to classify the inrush currents from power system disturbances. The classification problems in Artificial Intelligence (AI) are solved using neural networks. The neural networks derive its inspiration from neurons present in human body. The performance of NN is assessed based on the design of the hidden layers and by evaluating the weights that connect the nodes. There are no modifications made to the design of the hidden layers as the weight calculated is more important than the hidden structure. An optimum solution can be obtained by calculating the weights of NN by decreasing the function cost or error. This work aims to propose a modified neural network. The neural networks are trained using Firefly Algorithm (FA). Since this protocol is a simple and an efficient metaheuristic optimization technique which draws inspiration from fireflies which tend to move towards brighter light. The experimental results prove the computational efficiency of training process using firefly optimization technique.","2017-01","2021-04-19 15:57:06","2021-04-19 15:57:06","","215-224","","SI","12","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: SECTOR A-80, SCHEME NO 54, VIJAY NAGAR, A B ROAD, INDORE, 452 010 MP, INDIA Publisher: RESEARCH JOURNAL BIOTECHNOLOGY Type: Article","","","","","Artificial Neural Network (ANN); Firefly Algorithm (FA); Power Transformer Protection; Wavelet Transform (WT)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In our previous studies, we have focused only on the robot's emotional state. However, the emotional state of the other party is also an important factor for smooth conversation in human society. Therefore, the robot partner has two emotional structures for human: empathy and robot emotion. First, human empathy uses a perceptual based emotion model to know the human's emotional state based on the sensory information. Next, we propose a recurrent simple spike response model to improve the robot's emotional model, and we apply “Hebbian-LMS” learning to modify the weights in the spiking neural network. The robot's emotional state is calculated by using the human's emotional information, internal and external information. The robot partner can use the emotional results to control the facial and gesture expression. The utterance style is also changed by the robot's emotional state. As a result, the robot partner can interact emotionally and naturally with human. First, we explain the related works and the development of the robot partner “iPhonoid-C”. Next, we define the architecture of the emotional model to realize emotional empathy towards human. Then, we discuss the algorithms and the methods for developing the emotional model. Finally, we show experimental results of the proposed method, and discuss the effectiveness of the proposed structure.","2017","2021-04-19 15:57:07","2021-04-19 15:57:07","","258-285","","4","30","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: UNIV MALAYA, FAC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECH, KUALA LUMPUR, 50603, MALAYSIA Publisher: UNIV MALAYA, FAC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECH Type: Article","","","","","Conversation System; Emotional Empathy Model; Hebbian-LMS Learning; Recurrent Spiking Neural Network; Robot Partner","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Correspondingly, drift measurements in science are used as a means of rating the intensity of a body-ownership illusion via which a participant in a controlled experiment perceives that an extracorporeal appendage, or virtual whole-body avatar is incorporated as part of one's own body schema. In this research article, I will examine an applied performance by BeAnotherLab utilising the anti-disciplinary collective's The Machine to Be Another as part of Good Chance's Encampment project - this telepresence system produces a VR body illusion intended to increase empathy and reduce proximity between an immersant's real body and that of a volunteer refugee counterpart. When scientifically-tested body illusions cross a paradigmatic boundary to be framed as immersive art, what are the ethical implications? Furthermore, are these kinds of virtual proprioceptive transactions across different kinds of social and political boundaries symptomatic of radical empathic acts, or a capitalistic desire for the acquisition of another's experiences by virtual means? This article examines illusory bodily inhabitation through a Levinasian critical lens to consider the ethics of deterritorializing the immersant's gaze and referring their sense of touch elsewhere to produce narrative immersion'.","2017","2021-04-19 15:57:07","2021-04-19 15:57:07","","30-37","","3","22","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND Publisher: TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A fundamental characteristic of this new mode of production is multidisciplinary teams with a high level of technical knowledge and the ability to face several aspects of the production system, from production line up to customer interaction and integration with business and corporative systems. Besides, due to the velocity of transformations, the new employees must be able to learn and change quickly. Furthermore, such workers must develop intrinsically human characteristics like empathy, personal relationship and technical skills that machines won't be able to do, since all other activities would be done by machines with artificial intelligence and advanced robotics.

For artificial agents without emotional intelligence might generate behavior that is misinterpreted, unexpected, and confusing to humans, violating human expectations and possibly causing emotional harm. Surprisingly, there is a dearth of investigations aimed at understanding the extent to which artificial agents need emotional intelligence for successful interactions. Here, we present the first study in the perception of emotional intelligence (EI) in robots vs. humans. The objective was to determine whether people viewed robots as more or less emotionally intelligent when exhibiting similar behaviors as humans, and to investigate which verbal and nonverbal communication methods were most crucial for human observational judgments. Study participants were shown a scene in which either a robot or a human behaved with either high or low empathy, and then they were asked to evaluate the agent's emotional intelligence and trustworthiness. The results showed that participants could consistently distinguish the high EI condition from the low EI condition regardless of the variations in which communication methods were observed, and that whether the agent was a robot or human had no effect on the perception. We also found that relative to low EI high EI conditions led to greater trust in the agent, which implies that we must design robots to be emotionally intelligent if we wish for users to trust them.","2017","2021-04-19 15:57:11","2021-04-19 15:57:11","","129-141","","","10498","","","","Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence","","","","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: KTH Royal Inst Technol ISSN: 0302-9743 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>17th International Conference on Intelligent Virtual Agents (IVA), Swedish Natl Museum Sci &amp; Technol, Stockholm, SWEDEN, AUG 27-30, 2017</p>","","","","emotional intelligence; empathetic robot; Human-robot interaction","Beskow, J and Peters, C and Castellano, G and OSullivan, C and Leite, I and Kopp, S","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Digital games show some unique properties that make them valuable for inducing social change. Some of the game elements that can be used to integrate values are as follows: Narration, which is one of the elements that is most obvious to players and is part of most of today's digital games, is a proper way of presenting human rights topics and can also include ideological messages. However, there are also other ways of creating empathy for certain groups as the example of Ayitii - The Cost of Life shows: If players feel responsible for the game characters, games can make players think about the topic presented. Being able to take meaningful decisions which influence the player's avatar, other non-playable characters, the narration or the game-world is a property of many recent games. Thus, ethical decisions are included in games and put players into the shoes of those who are oppressed or put in other situations where there is no easy way of deciding if something is right or wrong. Finally, the article also discusses if these serious games can affect players' real lives and change their way of thinking and attitudes. The serious game This War of Mine shows that some players think about their decisions and the topic of the game even after having stopped playing. However, there are also restrictions to transferring game contents into players' lives and induce social change. Quite often it is not enough just to play the game, teaching which must take place in a non-game context, is needed to make players aware of human rights (violations).","2017","2021-04-19 15:57:12","2021-04-19 15:57:12","","191-196","","","","","","","Proceedings of the European Conference on Games-Based Learning","","","","ACAD CONFERENCES LTD","CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: FH JOANNEUM Univ Appl Sci ISSN: 2049-0992 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>11th European Conference on Game-Based Learning (ECGBL), Graz, AUSTRIA, OCT 05-06, 2017</p>","","","","empathy; game elements; human rights; serious games; social change","Pivec, M and Grundler, J","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A video camera was used to capture an actor's performance. The actor's eyes and mouth were isolated, and footage was processed as movie textures to overlay a static 3D model of a head. Micro expressions (subtle, rapid movements of muscles in and around the eyes and mouth in particular) are thus captured in a fine-grained, yet low- cost and low-tech alternative to established techniques. A future experiment will compare the emotive efficacy of the hybrid virtual agent with that of a conventional (fully CG) rigged avatar head in a 6DoF scenario that transitions from sympathetic (gauging empathy by self-report) to confrontational (gauging physiological arousal by heart-rate or GSR).

An understanding of emotional interactions would be essential to such robots' behavior. To improve the cognitive and behavior systems of such robots, we propose the use of an artificial topological consciousness that uses a synthetic neurotransmitter and motivation, including a biologically inspired emotion system. A fundamental aspect of a companion robot is a cross communication system that enables natural interactions between humans and the robot. This paper focuses on three points in the development of our proposed framework: (1) the organization of the behavior including inside-state emotion regarding the phylogenetic consciousness-based architecture; (2) a method whereby the robot can have empathy toward its human user's expressions of emotion; and (3) a method that enables the robot to select a facial expression in response to the human user, providing instant human-like `emotion' and based on emotional intelligence (El) that uses a biologically inspired topological online method to express, for example, encouragement or being delighted. We also demonstrate the performance of the artificial consciousness based on the complexity level and a robot's social expressions that are designed to enhance the users affinity with the robot.

Currently, there are many devices that allow gathering biometric measurements from human beings, such as EEG Headsets or Health Bracelets. The massive data sets generated by tracking of EEG and physiology may be used, among other things, to infer knowledge about human moods and emotions. Apart from direct biometric signal measurement, eye tracking systems are nowadays capable of determining the point of gaze of the users when interacting in ICT environments, which provides an added value research on many different areas, such as psychology or marketing. We present a process in which devices for eye tracking, biometric, and EEG signal measurements are synchronously used for studying both basic and complex emotions. We selected the least intrusive devices for different signal data collection given the study requirements and cost constraints, so users would behave in the most natural way possible. On the one hand, we have been able to determine basic emotions participants were experiencing by means of valence and arousal. On the other hand, a complex emotion such as empathy has also been detected. To validate the usefulness of this approach, a study involving forty-four people has been carried out, where they were exposed to a series of affective stimuli while their EEG activity, biometric signals, and eye position were synchronously recorded to detect self-regulation. The hypothesis of the work was that people who self-regulated would show significantly different results when analyzing their EEG data. Participants were divided into two groups depending on whether Electro Dermal Activity (EDA) data indicated they self-regulated or not. The comparison of the results obtained using different machine learning algorithms for emotion recognition shows that using EEG activity alone as a predictor for self-regulation does not allow properly determining whether a person in self-regulation its emotions while watching affective stimuli. However, adequately combining different data sources in a synchronous way to detect emotions makes it possible to overcome the limitations of single detection methods.","2016-08-19","2021-04-19 15:57:14","2021-04-19 15:57:14","","","","","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND Publisher: FRONTIERS MEDIA SA Type: Article","","","","","biometric information; EEG; emotions; empathy; eye tracking","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this article in order to analyze human behaviors in social context, we propose a new approach which explores interrelations between body part motions in scenarios with people doing a conversation. The novelty of this method is that we analyze body motion-based features in frequency domain to estimate different human social patterns: Interpersonal Behaviors (IBs) and a Social Role (SR). To analyze the dynamics and interrelations of people's body motions, a human movement descriptor is used to extract discriminative features, and a multi-layer Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) technique is proposed to model the existent dependencies. Laban Movement Analysis (LMA) is a well-known human movement descriptor, which provides efficient mid-level information of human body motions. The mid-level information is useful to extract the complex interdependencies. The DBN technique is tested in different scenarios to model the mentioned complex dependencies. The study is applied for obtaining four IBs (Interest, Indicator, Empathy and Emphasis) to estimate one SR (Leading). The obtained results give a good indication of the capabilities of the proposed approach for people interaction analysis with potential applications in human-robot interaction.","2016-08","2021-04-19 15:57:15","2021-04-19 15:57:15","","1679-1691","","8, SI","38","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA Publisher: IEEE COMPUTER SOC Type: Article","","","","","Bayesian approach; frequency domain; human movement analysis; social role; Social signal processing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There is an ongoing effort to find a HIP that is secure enough yet easy for humans. Recently, a new HIP has been designed aiming at higher security: the Civil Rights Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart (CAPTCHA). It employs the empathy capacity of humans to further strengthen Securimage, a well-known text CAPTCHA. In this paper, we analyze it from a security perspective, finding fundamental design flaws. Using several well-known machine learning (ML) algorithms, we analyze to what extent these flaws affect its security. We discover that thanks to them, we can create a successful side-channel attack. This attack is able to correctly solve the HIP on 20.7% of occasions, much more than enough to consider it broken. Thus, we show that there is no need to solve the problem of optical character recognition nor empathy analysis for computers to break this particular HIP. ML can be successfully used to break a HIP that uses both with a side-channel attack. This security analysis can be applied to other HIPs. It will allow to test whether they are leaking too much information by unexpected ways, given non-evident design flaws.

In motivational interviewing, it is desirable for the counselor to communicate empathy towards the client to promote better therapy outcomes. In this paper, we propose a deep neural network (DNN) system for predicting counselors' session level empathy ratings from transcripts of the interactions. First, we train a recurrent neural network mapping the text of each speaker turn to a set of task-specific behavioral acts that represent local dynamics of the client-counselor interaction. Subsequently, this network is used to initialize lower layers of a deep network predicting session level counselor empathy rating. We show that this method outperforms training the DNN end-to-end in a single stage and also outperforms a baseline neural network model that attempts to predict empathy ratings directly from text without modeling turn level behavioral dynamics.","2016","2021-04-19 15:57:16","2021-04-19 15:57:16","","1447-1451","","","","","","","Interspeech","","","","ISCA-INT SPEECH COMMUNICATION ASSOC","C/O EMMANUELLE FOXONET, 4 RUE DES FAUVETTES, LIEU DIT LOUS TOURILS, BAIXAS, F-66390, FRANCE","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: apple; amazon alexa; Google; Microsoft; ebay; facebook; YAHOO JAPAN; Baidu Res; IBM Res; CIRRUS LOGIC; DATATANG; NUANCE; Speechocean Ltd; Yandex; Raytheon Technol ISSN: 2308-457X Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>17th Annual Conference of the International-Speech-Communication-Association (INTERSPEECH 2016), San Francisco, CA, SEP 08-12, 2016</p>","","","","behavioral signal processing; motivational interviews; recurrent neural networks; word embedding","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this regard, many social robots based on reactive system have been developed to provide companionship for elderly adults with neurocognitive impairments such as dementia. However, these systems remain a problem such that no interactive dynamics of body gestures between human and robot has been considered. In this research, therefore, we developed a head motion synchronization system using mutual entrainment and implement it in a communication robot. This system was evaluated by conducting one-way face-to-face human-robot communication experiments with young native Japanese speakers under three conditions, namely unreactive, reactive and interactive conditions. Head motion synchrony analysis revealed a leader-follower relationship for the reactive model and a mutual entrainment of head motion for the interactive model. Also, questionnaire survey results showed the degree of empathy for interactive condition was significantly higher as compared with reactive and unreactive conditions. In addition, the degree of naturalness for interactive condition was significantly higher as compared with unreactive condition. Hence, these indicate that empathy was shared through mutual entrainment of head motion, which could provide a smooth interface in human-robot communication. This system would be extended to elderly adults as an assistive system for the elderly's rehabilitation.","2016","2021-04-19 15:57:20","2021-04-19 15:57:20","","1514-1519","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","English","","","","","","","Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>55th Annual Conference of the Society of Instrument and Control Engineers of Japan (SICE), Tsukuba, JAPAN, SEP 20-23, 2016</p>","","","","Head motion synchronization; human-robot interaction; mutual entrainment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper aims at exploring the phenomenon of responses to humor interventions from the robot through the examination of a corpus. We assume that using humor in human-robot interaction sets up a positive atmosphere in which participants are willing to contribute. This study relies on 49 human-robot interaction dialogues and 381 adjacency pairs of humorous acts made by the robot and the following human responses. The human humor responses, elicited through canned jokes and conversational humor, were annotated. Three main categories of human responses were found (1) providing no support, (2) recognizing the attempt of humor and (3) contributing with more humor. The findings indicate that, as in human-human interaction, strategies of humor support are strongly dependent of the humorous event's context.","2016","2021-04-19 15:57:22","2021-04-19 15:57:22","","305-316","","","9749","","","","Lecture Notes in Computer Science","","","","SPRINGER INT PUBLISHING AG","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","English","","","","","","","ISSN: 0302-9743 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>4th International Conference on Distributed, Ambient and Pervasive Interactions (DAPI) held as part of 18th International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI International), Toronto, CANADA, JUL 17-22, 2016</p>","","","","","Streitz, N and Markopoulos, P","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One of the robots used in this study called MARC (See Fig. 1) was given a series of biased behaviours such as forgetting participant's names, denying its own faults for failures, unable to understand what a participant is saying, etc. Such fallible behaviours were compared to a non-biased baseline behaviour. In the current paper, we present a comparison of two case studies using these biases and a non-biased algorithm. It is hoped that such humanlike fallible characteristics can help in developing a more natural and believable companionship between Robots and Humans.

In 1968, Philip K. Dick wrote the book Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? which became the inspiration for the 1982 film Bladerunner. The book is set in Los Angeles in a post-apocalyptic future where mankind has left Earth, resulting in androids being created to develop new `off-world' colonies. The book and film create a novel and interesting framework to discuss the subject of replicas and replication within contemporary conservation practice. Key themes are decay promoting replication, original versus replica, creating empathy in replication. The debate focuses on the case study of Naum Gabo's Construction in Space (Crystal) of 1937-39; which was the sculpture replicated in the most recent replication project at Tate, completed in July 2015.","2016","2021-04-19 15:57:25","2021-04-19 15:57:25","","109-113","","2, SI","61","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND Publisher: ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD Type: Article","","","","","Decay; Empathy; Gabo; Original; Replica; Replicants","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In facts, a principal defining characteristic of human social behaviour is empathy. The present paper presents a robotic architecture for an android robot as a basis for natural empathic human-android interaction. We start from the hypothesis that the robots, in order to become personal companions need to know how to empathic interact with human beings. To validate our research, we have used the proposed system with the minimalistic humanoid robot Telenoid. We have conducted human-robot interactions test with elderly people with no prior interaction experience with robot. During the experiment, elderly persons engaged a stimulated conversation with the humanoid robot. Our goal is to overcome the state of loneliness of elderly people using this minimalistic humanoid robot capable to exhibit a dialogue similar to what usually happens in real life between human beings. The experimental results have shown a humanoid robotic system capable to exhibit a natural and empathic interaction and conversation with a human user.","2016","2021-04-19 15:57:25","2021-04-19 15:57:25","","939-953","","","302","","","","Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing","","","","SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN","HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: Univ Padova ISSN: 2194-5357 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>13th International Conference on Intelligent Autonomous Systems (IAS), Centro Congressi Padova, Padova, ITALY, JUL 15-18, 2014</p>","","","","Humanoid robot; Humanoid robot interaction; Life support empathic robot; Telenoid","Menegatti, E and Michael, N and Berns, K and Yamaguchi, H","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, selection in a great number of medical schools worldwide is still based on knowledge exams, a procedure that might neglect students with needed personal characteristics for future medical practice. We investigated whether the personal profile of students selected through a knowledge-based exam differed from those not selected. Methods: Students applying for medical school (N = 311) completed questionnaires assessing motivations for becoming a doctor, learning approaches, personality traits, empathy, and coping styles. Selection was based on the results of MCQ tests. Principal component analysis was used to draw a profile of the students. Differences between selected and non-selected students were examined by Multivariate ANOVAs, and their impact on selection by logistic regression analysis. Results: Students demonstrating a profile of diligence with higher conscientiousness, deep learning approach, and task-focused coping were more frequently selected (p = 0.01). Other personal characteristics such as motivation, sociability, and empathy did not significantly differ, comparing selected and non-selected students. Conclusion: Selection through a knowledge-based exam privileged diligent students. It did neither advantage nor preclude candidates with a more humane profile.","2016","2021-04-19 15:57:27","2021-04-19 15:57:27","","","","","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND Publisher: TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD Type: Article","","","","","assessment; medical students; personal characteristics; profile; selection; undergraduate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Analyses focused on the relationship between empathy and two perspective-taking phenomena: Selection between competing perspectives (i.e., perspective-congruence effects) and prioritization of the Self avatar's perspective. Empathy was related to improved overall performance on this task and a reduced cost of selecting between conflicting perspectives (i.e., smaller perspective-congruence effects). This effect was asymmetric, with empathy (i.e., empathic concern) levels predicting reduced interference from a conflicting perspective, especially when adopting the Self (vs. Other) avatar's perspective. Taken together, these results highlight the importance of the self-other distinction and mental flexibility components of empathy.","2016","2021-04-19 15:57:27","2021-04-19 15:57:27","","170-181","","1-4, SI","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND Publisher: ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD Type: Article","","","","","Empathy; Personal relevance; Self-tagging; Visual perspective-taking","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite several studies on when to backchannel, most of the current spoken dialogue systems generate the same pattern of backchannels, giving monotonous impressions to users. In this work, we investigate generation of a variety of backchannel forms according to the dialogue context. We first show the feasibility of choosing appropriate backchannel forms based on machine learning, and the synergy of using linguistic and prosodic features. For generation of backchannels, a framework based on a set of binary classifiers is adopted to effectively make a “not-to-generate” decision. The proposed model achieved better prediction accuracy than a baseline which always outputs the same backchannel form and another baseline which randomly generates backchannels. Finally, evaluations by human subjects demonstrate that the proposed method generates backchannels as naturally as human choices, giving impressions of understanding and empathy.","2016","2021-04-19 15:57:27","2021-04-19 15:57:27","","2890-2894","","","","","","","Interspeech","","","","ISCA-INT SPEECH COMMUNICATION ASSOC","C/O EMMANUELLE FOXONET, 4 RUE DES FAUVETTES, LIEU DIT LOUS TOURILS, BAIXAS, F-66390, FRANCE","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: apple; amazon alexa; Google; Microsoft; ebay; facebook; YAHOO JAPAN; Baidu Res; IBM Res; CIRRUS LOGIC; DATATANG; NUANCE; Speechocean Ltd; Yandex; Raytheon Technol ISSN: 2308-457X Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>17th Annual Conference of the International-Speech-Communication-Association (INTERSPEECH 2016), San Francisco, CA, SEP 08-12, 2016</p>","","","","attentive listening; backchannel; spoken dialogue systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although the most persuasive computer interfaces are often the most human-like, they have been predicted to incur the greatest risk of falling into the uncanny valley, the loss of empathy attributed to characters that appear eerily human. Previous studies compared interfaces on the left side of the uncanny valley, namely, those with low human likeness. To examine interfaces with higher human realism, a between-groups factorial experiment was conducted through the internet with 426 midwestern U.S. undergraduates. This experiment presented a hypothetical ethical dilemma followed by the advice of an authority figure. The authority was manipulated in three ways: depiction (digitally recorded or computer animated), motion quality (smooth or jerky), and advice (disclose or refrain from disclosing sensitive information). Of these, only the advice changed opinion about the ethical dilemma, even though the animated depiction was significantly eerier than the human depiction. These results indicate that compliance with an authority persists even when using an uncannily realistic computer-animated double.","2015","2021-04-19 15:57:29","2021-04-19 15:57:29","","1-23","","1","24","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA Publisher: MIT PRESS Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We found that the descending phase of the P3 component was larger for the painful stimuli than the non-painful stimuli, regardless of whether the hand belonged to a human or robot. In contrast, the ascending phase of the P3 component at the frontal-central electrodes was increased by painful human stimuli but not painful robot stimuli, though the interaction of ANOVA was not significant, but marginal.

In the current study, we explored the relationship between visuospatial perspective taking and self-report measures of the cognitive and emotional components of empathy in young adults. To this aim, we employed a priming paradigm, in which the presence of an avatar allowed to anticipate the next perceived perspective on the visual scene. We found that the emotional dimension of empathy was positively correlated with the behavioral advantage provided by the presence of the avatar, relative to unprimed perspective changes.

In particular, we conducted an exploratory study to empirically examine children's perceptions toward the computer- and robot-mediated AR systems designed to make dramatic play activities interactive and participatory. A multi-disciplinary expert group consisting of early childhood education experts, preschool teachers, AR specialists, and robot engineers collaborated to develop a learning scenario and technological systems for dramatic play. The experiment was conducted in a kindergarten setting in Korea, with 81 children (aged 5-6 years old). The participants were placed either in the computer-mediated AR condition (n = 40) or the robot-mediated AR condition (n = 41). We administered an instrument to measure children's perceived levels of the following variables: (a) satisfaction (i.e., interest in dramatic play & user-friendliness), (b) sensory immersion (i.e., self-engagement, environment-engagement & interaction-engagement), and (c) media recognition (i.e., collaboration with media, media function & empathy with media). Data analysis indicates that children in the robot-mediated condition showed significantly higher perceptions than those in the computer-mediated condition regarding the following aspects: interest in dramatic play (satisfaction), interactive engagement (sensory immersion), and empathy with media (media recognition). Furthermore, it was found that the younger-aged children and girls, in particular, perceived AR-infused dramatic play more positively than the older-aged children and boys, respectively. The contribution of this study is to provide empirical evidence about the affordances of robots and AR-based learning systems for young children. This remains a relatively unexplored area of research in the field of learning technologies. Implications of the current study and future research directions are also discussed.","2015-06","2021-04-19 15:57:30","2021-04-19 15:57:30","","455-474","","3","63","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article","","","","","Augmented reality; Dramatic play; Educational robot","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The challenge stems partly from the complexity and fluidity of this social process, but also from its covert nature. One powerful tool to enhance experimental control over such dynamic social interactions has been the use of avatars in virtual reality (VR); information about an individual in such an interaction can be collected through the analysis of his or her neurophysiological and behavioral responses. We have developed a unique platform, the Empathy-Enhancing Virtual Evolving Environment (EEVEE), which is built around three main components: (1) different avatars capable of expressing feelings and emotions at various levels based on the Facial Action Coding System (FACS); (2) systems for measuring the physiological responses of the observer (heart and respiration rate, skin conductance, gaze and eye movements, facial expression); and (3) a multimodal interface linking the avatar's behavior to the observer's neurophysiological response. In this article, we provide a detailed description of the components of this innovative platform and validation data from the first phases of development. Our data show that healthy adults can discriminate different negative emotions, including pain, expressed by avatars at varying intensities. We also provide evidence that masking part of an avatar's face (top or bottom half) does not prevent the detection of different levels of pain. This innovative and flexible platform provides a unique tool to study and even modulate empathy in a comprehensive and ecological manner in various populations, notably individuals suffering from neurological or psychiatric disorders.","2015-03-10","2021-04-19 15:57:31","2021-04-19 15:57:31","","","","","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND Publisher: FRONTIERS MEDIA SA Type: Article","","","","","affective computing; avatar; emotions; empathy; FACS; pain; virtual reality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

First, we address the detection of action units (AUs) of the facial action coding system using active shape models and Gabor filters. Normalized outputs of the AU recognition step are then used as inputs for a neural network that consists of an habituation network plus a competitive network. Both the competitive and the habituation layer use differential equations, thus taking into account the dynamic information of facial expressions through time. Experimental results carried out on live video sequences and on the Cohn-Kanade face database show that the proposed method provides high recognition hit rates. To assess the suitability of the developed emotional recognition system for human-computer interaction applications, it has been successfully integrated in the architecture of an avatar and we have conducted a preliminary experiment on empathy. The experiment showed promising results, as the avatar that made use of the emotional recognition system obtained a clear increase in the positivity of the rating when compared with the same avatar with no emotional response.","2015-03","2021-04-19 15:57:31","2021-04-19 15:57:31","","99-119","","2","27","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND Publisher: OXFORD UNIV PRESS Type: Article","","","","","agent-based interaction; computer vision; empirical studies in ubiquitous and mobile computing; gestural input; graphical user interfaces; intelligent avatars","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

On the one hand, we performed this study to assess the quality of the current facial expressions of two robot heads. On the other hand, we aimed at developing a simple, easy-to-use methodological variation to evaluate facial expressions of robotic heads. Short movie clips of two different robot heads showing a happy, sad, surprised, and neutral facial expression were compiled into an online survey, to examine how people interpret these expressions. Additionally, we added a control condition with a human face showing the same four emotions. The results showed that the facial expressions could be recognized well for both heads. Even the blender emotion surprised was recognized, although it resulted in positive and negative connotations. These results underline the importance of the situational context to correctly interpret emotional facial expressions. Besides the expected finding that the human is perceived significantly more anthropomorphic and animate than both robot heads, the more human-like designed robot head was rated significantly higher with respect to anthropomorphism than the robot head using animal-like features. In terms of the validation procedure, we could provide evidence for a feasible two-step procedure. By assessing the participants' dispositional empathy with a questionnaire it can be ensured that they are in general able to decode facial expressions into the corresponding emotion.

Its first dimension is auto-empathy and refers to an empathetic relationship with oneself: how can a human directing a robot expand the various components of empathy he feels for himself to this robot? The second is direct empathy: what does a human attribute to a robot in terms of thoughts, emotions, action potentials or even altruism, on the model of what he imagines and attributes to himself? The third dimension is reciprocal empathy that consists of thinking that a robot is able to identify with me, feel or guess my emotions and thoughts, anticipate my actions and wear me assistance if necessary. Finally, the fourth dimension, intersubjective empathy, is about thinking and imagining that a robot can inform me of things - emotions, thoughts that I am likely to experience- that I do not know about myself. Each of these four dimensions includes four different components: (1) Action (empathy of action), (2) Emotion (emotional empathy), (3) Cognition (cognitive empathy) and (4) Assistance (empathy of assistance). This theoretical model of empathy in four dimensions and four components defines sixteen items whose relevance will be tested in the near future through comparative experimental research involving human-human and human-robot interaction.","2015-02","2021-04-19 15:57:33","2021-04-19 15:57:33","","97-102","","1","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article","","","","","Auto-empathy; Direct empathy; Empathy with robots; Human-robot interaction; Intersubjective empathy; Psychology; Reciprocal empathy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

What exactly is empathy, and why do most humans have it? We present a model which suggests that empathy is an emergent behavior with four main elements: a mirror neuron system, somatosensory cortices, an insula, and infant-directed “baby talk” or motherese. To test our hypothesis, we implemented a robot called MEI (multimodal emotional intelligence) with these functions, and allowed it to interact with human caregivers using comfort and approval motherese, the first kinds of vocalizations heard by infants at 3 and 6 months of age. The robot synchronized in real-time to the humans through voice and movement dynamics, while training statistical models associated with its low level gut feeling (”flourishing” or “distress”, based on battery or temperature). Experiments show that the post-interaction robot associates novel happy voices with physical flourishing 90 % of the time, sad voices with distress 84 % of the time. Our results also show that a robot trained with infant-directed “attention bids” can recognize adult fear voices. Importantly, this is the first emotion system to recognize adult emotional voices after training only with motherese, suggesting that this specific parental behavior may help build emotional intelligence.","2015-02","2021-04-19 15:57:34","2021-04-19 15:57:34","","35-49","","1","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article","","","","","Developmental robotics; Emotional contagion based on SIRE model; MEI robot; Robot empathy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The system comprises of a Microsoft kinect device that captures RGB and depth data to compute visual cues and microphones to capture speech cues from an on-going conversation. With these non-verbal cues as features, machine learning algorithms are implemented in the system to extract multiple indicators of social behavior including empathy, confusion and politeness. The system is trained and tested on two carefully annotated corpora that consist of two person dialogs.

It is projected to design the model capable of different empathic responses (parallel and reactive) during the course of interaction with the user, depending upon the personality and mood factors of the robot. The proposed model encompasses three main stages i.e., perception, empathic appraisal and empathic expression. Perception refers to capturing user's emotion state via facial expression recognition. Empathic appraisal is based on the computational emotional model for generating its internal emotions, mood state and empathic responses. The internal emotions are defined using psychological studies and generated on 2D (pleasure-arousal) scaling model; whereas, fuzzy logic is used to calculate the intensity of the each emotion. A virtual facial expression simulator is applied for expression of resultant empathic emotions. Preliminary experimental results show that the proposed model is capable of exhibiting different empathic responses with respect to the personality and mood factors.","2015","2021-04-19 15:57:37","2021-04-19 15:57:37","","109-116","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: IEEE; IEEE Computational Intelligence Soc; IEEE BigData Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>IEEE Symposium Series Computational Intelligence, Cape Town, SOUTH AFRICA, DEC 07-10, 2015</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We measure the effects of lifelike movement and stories on people's hesitation to strike the robot, and we evaluate the relationship between hesitation and people's trait empathy. Our results show that people with a certain type of high trait empathy (empathic concern) hesitate to strike the robots. We also find that high empathic concern and hesitation are more strongly related for robots with stories.

This is a common scenario in modern computer games, where players interact with NPCs assuming the guise of human characters. To explore this question, an online game was developed in which a human player had a primary objective of surviving against increasingly difficult waves of enemies. As a secondary objective, the player was tasked with protecting an unarmed NPC companion which assumed either a human, or non-human identity, but with identical underlying Artificial Intelligence. The intention was to explore whether the human player would be more or less protective of a synthetic companion simply due to the identity assumed. The results of the study demonstrate that player's behavior does change based on identity, and clearly indicates that the player was more protective of the companion assuming a human identity. Furthermore, the results show that this phenomenon extends beyond simple human and non-human identities, and that the specific persona, or gender of the NPC may influence the player's empathy towards it.","2015","2021-04-19 15:57:39","2021-04-19 15:57:39","","145-152","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: Soc Art & Sci; Uppsala Univ; Dept Game design Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>International Conference on Cyberworlds (CW), Visby, SWEDEN, OCT 07-09, 2015</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite the production of different computational models, their integration with cognitive and psychological theories remains a central problem. Reasons are both methodological and theoretical. Primarily, it is difficult to quantify the impact of such factors as individual differences, inclinations and personality traits. In addition, Agent-Based Models (ABMs) often use linear dynamics, even in describing emotions, without considering the basis of psychophysics. Bearing in mind this and focusing on compassion as a particular emotion, the paper aims to present a “Decalogue” for those interested in designing agents capable of mimicking human emotional behaviors. In the paper, compassion will be translated as prosocial behavior.","2015","2021-04-19 15:57:40","2021-04-19 15:57:40","","207-214","","","372","","","","Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing","","","","SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN","HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: IBM; IEEE Syst Man & Cybernet Soc Spain; AEPIA; Assoc Francaise Intelligence Artificielle; AAAI; APPIA; ARIA; ATIA; BNVKI; SADIO; Soc Brasileira Computacao; GI; Univ Salamanca; CNRS; Portuguese Assoc Artificial Intelligence; Telefonica; Bioinformat Intelligent Syst & Educ Technol Res Grp; Junta Castilla Leon; Univ Salamanca; indra ISSN: 2194-5357 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>13th International Conference on Practical Applications of Agents, Multi-Agent Systems, and Sustainability (PAAMS), Salamanca, SPAIN, JUN 03-05, 2015</p>","","","","Compassion; Emotional behaviors; Prosocial Behavior; Psychophysics","Bajo, J and Hernandez, JZ and Mathieu, P and Campbell, A and FernandezCaballero, A and Moreno, MN and Julian, V and AlonsoBetanzos, A and JimenezLopez, MD and Botti, V","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The robot's function is to increase people's awareness to the effect of their behavior towards others, potentially leading to behavior change. Specifically, Kip1 is designed to promote non-aggressive conversation between people. It monitors the conversation's nonverbal aspects and maintains an emotional model of its reaction to the conversation. If the conversation seems calm, Kip1 responds by a gesture designed to communicate curious interest. If the conversation seems aggressive, Kip1 responds by a gesture designed to communicate fear. We describe the design process of Kip1, guided by the principles of peripheral and evocative. We detail its hardware and software systems, and a study evaluating the effects of the robot's autonomous behavior on couples' conversations. We find support for our design goals. A conversation companion reacting to the conversation led to more gaze attention, but not more verbal distraction, compared to a robot that moves but does not react to the conversation. This suggests that robotic devices could be designed as companions to human-human interaction without compromising the natural communication flow between people. Participants also rated the reacting robot as having significantly more social human character traits and as being significantly more similar to them. This points to the robot's potential to elicit people's empathy.","2015","2021-04-19 15:57:41","2021-04-19 15:57:41","","3-10","","","","","","","ACM IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction","","","","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: IEEE; ACM; ACM SIGCHI; ACM SIGART; IEEE Robot & Automat Soc; AAAI; HFES; ACM SIGAI ISSN: 2167-2121 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>10th Annual ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), Portland, OR, MAR 02-05, 2015</p>","","","","Ambient kinetic tangibles; Behavior change; Design; Empathy; Human-robot interaction; Robotic companions; Smartphone robots","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The system relies on the learning by teaching paradigm to build an interaction, so as to stimulate meta-cognition, empathy and increased self-esteem in the child user. We hypothesise that use of a humanoid robot in such a system could not just engage an unmotivated student, but could also present the opportunity for children to experience physically-induced bene fits encountered during human-led handwriting interventions, such as motor mimicry. By leveraging simulated handwriting on a synchronised tablet display, anao humanoid robot with limited fine motor capabilities has been con figured as a suitably embodied handwriting partner. Statistical shape models derived from principal component analysis of a dataset of adult-written letter trajectories allow the robot to draw purposefully deformed letters. By incorporating feedback from user demonstrations, the system is then able to learn the optimal parameters for the appropriate shape models. Preliminary in situ studies have been conducted with primary school classes to obtain insight into children's use of the novel system. Children aged 6-8 successfully engaged with the robot and improved its writing to a level which they were satisfied with. The validation of the interaction represents a significant step towards an innovative use for robotics which addresses a widespread and socially meaningful challenge in education.","2015","2021-04-19 15:57:42","2021-04-19 15:57:42","","83-90","","","","","","","ACM IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction","","","","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: IEEE; ACM; ACM SIGCHI; ACM SIGART; IEEE Robot & Automat Soc; AAAI; HFES; ACM SIGAI ISSN: 2167-2121 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>10th Annual ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), Portland, OR, MAR 02-05, 2015</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A group of participants is used to evaluate how imitation by a robot affects people's perception of their conversation with it. A set of twelve questions about the participants' university experience serves as a backbone for the dialogue structure. In our experimental evaluation, the robot reacts in one of three ways to the human upper body pose: ignoring it, displaying its own upper body pose, and mirroring it. The manner in which the robot behaviour influences human appraisal is analysed using the standard Godspeed questionnaire. Our results show that robot body mirroring/non-mirroring influences the perceived humanness of the robot. The results also indicate that body pose mirroring is an important factor in facilitating rapport and empathy in human social interactions with robots.","2015","2021-04-19 15:57:43","2021-04-19 15:57:43","","214-223","","","9388","","","","Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence","","","","SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN","HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY","English","","","","","","","ISSN: 0302-9743 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>7th International Conference on Social Robotics (ICSR), Paris, FRANCE, OCT 26-30, 2015</p>","","","","Anthropomorphism; Body-pose mirroring; Empathy; Rapport","Tapus, A and Andre, E and Martin, JC and Ferland, F and Ammi, M","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our approach to uphold PD patient dignity is through the use of an ethical robot that mediates patient shame when it recognizes norm violations in the patient-caregiver interaction. This paper presents the basis for a computational model tasked with computing patient shame and the empathetic response of a caregiver during “empathetic opportunities” in their interaction. A PD patient is liable to suffer indignity when there is a substantial difference between his experienced shame and the empathy shown by the caregiver. When this difference falls outside of acceptable set bounds (norms), the robotic agent will act using subtle, nonverbal cues to guide the relationship back within these bounds, preserving patient dignity.","2015","2021-04-19 15:57:44","2021-04-19 15:57:44","","532-542","","","9388","","","","Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence","","","","SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN","HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY","English","","","","","","","ISSN: 0302-9743 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>7th International Conference on Social Robotics (ICSR), Paris, FRANCE, OCT 26-30, 2015</p>","","","","","Tapus, A and Andre, E and Martin, JC and Ferland, F and Ammi, M","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The parameters governing the robotised elements we propose are mainly qualitative (emotions and aesthetical perception), which cannot easily be described by mathematical parameters. Additionally, due to their complexity, it is often impossible - or at least impractical, to hardcode suitable controllers for such structures. Thus, we propose the use of Artificial Intelligence learning techniques, concretely Evolutionary Algorithms, to allow the user to teach the robotised components how to behave in response to their resemblance to specific animal behaviors.

However, it is important to consider how interaction with a simulated robot differs from a real robot; that is, do simulated robots provide authentic interaction? We contribute to a growing body of work that explores this question and maps out simulated-versus-real differences, by explicitly investigating empathy: how people empathize with a physical or simulated robot when something bad happens to it. Our results suggest that people may empathize more with a physical robot than a simulated one, a finding that has important implications on the generalizability and applicability of simulated HRI work. Empathy is particularly relevant to social HRI and is integral to, for example, companion and care robots. Our contribution additionally includes an original and reproducible HRI experimental design to induce empathy toward robots in laboratory settings, and an experimentally validated empathy-measuring instrument from psychology for use with HRI.","2015","2021-04-19 15:57:47","2021-04-19 15:57:47","","125-132","","","","","","","ACM IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction","","","","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: IEEE; ACM; ACM SIGCHI; ACM SIGART; IEEE Robot & Automat Soc; AAAI; HFES; ACM SIGAI ISSN: 2167-2121 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>10th Annual ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), Portland, OR, MAR 02-05, 2015</p>","","","","empathy; Human-robot interaction; robot embodiment; simulated interaction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
