Design/methodology/approach Data collected from an electronic questionnaire include 433 responses from Spanish visitors. The authors subjected the variables proposed by De Kervenoael et al. (2020) adapted to museums. The initial descriptive analysis only showed significant differences by age (under or over 30 years old). Based on these previous results, an exploratory factor analysis was carried out to test the applicability of the questionnaire to museums. After identifying the factors, the authors applied an ANOVA test to determine whether there are age-related differences between the factors related to robot acceptance in museums. Findings The authors developed a multidimensional instrument for measuring willingness to accept social robots in museum contexts. Willingness is determined by three factors: museum visitor experience (which is a factor specific to museums), empathy and personal engagement (which are both usually relevant in other tourist sectors as well). The younger individuals (under 30 years old) have a higher degree of acceptance than do visitors over 30. Originality/value Social robot use in museums is still very low, so the key factors for their acceptance have yet to be ascertained. The specific skills of social robots could prove to be a major draw for young people and contribute significantly to the future of museums.","","2021-05-19 13:29:52","2021-05-19 13:29:52","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND Publisher: EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD Type: Article; Early Access","","","","","Empathy; Human-robot interaction; Experience; Museums; Personal engagement; Social robot acceptance; Visitor profile","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The present study aimed to explore the predictors of compassion fatigue among a high-risk population of psychological hotline counselors. Seven hundred and twelve psychological hotline counselors were recruited from the Mental Health Service Platform at Central China Normal University, Ministry of Education, then were asked to complete the questionnaires measuring compassion fatigue, trait empathy, social support, trait mindfulness, counselor's self-efficacy, humor, life meaning, and post-traumatic growth. A chi-square test was utilized to filter for the top-20 predictive variables. Machine learning techniques, including logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, k-nearest neighbor, support vector machine, and naive Bayes were employed to predict compassion fatigue. The results showed that the most important predictors of compassion fatigue were meaning in life, counselors' self-efficacy, mindfulness, and empathy. Except for the decision tree, the rest machine learning techniques obtained good performance. Naive Bayes presented the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.803. Random forest achieved the least classification error of 23.64, followed by Naive Bayes with a classification error of 23.85. These findings support the potential application of machine learning techniques in the prediction of compassion fatigue.","","2021-05-19 13:29:52","2021-05-19 13:29:52","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article; Early Access","","","","","COVID-19; Machine learning; Compassion fatigue; Hotline psychological counselor","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This emotional model is based on a biopsychological approach to the analysis of the humans' emotional state. In this research, Fuzzy Grey Cognitive Maps are used, which are an extension of the fuzzy cognitive maps using the grey systems theory to model uncertainty. Fuzzy Cognitive Grey Maps (FGCMs) have become a very valuable theory for modeling high-uncertainty systems when small and incomplete discrete data sets are available.

But the fact that the term `empathy' has strong social connotations raises a question: can it be applied to robots? Can we actually use social terms and explanations in relation to these inanimate machines? In this article, I analyse the range of uses of the term empathy in the field of HRI studies and social robotics, and consider the substantial, functional and relational positions on this issue. I focus on the relational (cooperational) perspective presented by Luisa Damiano and Paul Dumouchel, who interpret emotions (together with empathy) as being the result of affective coordination. I also reflect on the criteria that should be used to determine when, in such relations, we are dealing with actual empathy.","","2021-05-19 13:29:53","2021-05-19 13:29:53","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article; Early Access","","","","","Empathy; Social robots; Neuroscience; Human&#8211; robot interactions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Moreover, it is unclear whether all customers respond to the interaction with frontline service robots in the same way. Our research looks at how individual differences in social behaviors, specifically in customers' attachment styles, influence three types of customer responses: affective responses (experienced pleasantness), attitudinal responses (perceived empathy, satisfaction), and behavioral responses (word-of-mouth). Three experimental studies reveal that customers with low (vs. high) scores on anxious attachment style (AAS) measures respond more negatively to frontline service robot (compared to a frontline human agent). We investigate alternative explanations for these findings, such as robots' level of anthropomorphism and we show that human-likeness features such as voice type and level of human-like physical appearance, cannot explain our findings. Our results indicate that for low-AAS customers replacing frontline human service agent with frontline robot undermines customer attitude and behavioral responses to service robots, leading to possible implications on customer segmentation, targeting, and marketing communication.","2021-05","2021-05-19 13:29:53","2021-05-19 13:29:53","","881-895","","5","38","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article","","","","","empathy; service robots; anthropomorphism; attachment styles; social response","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, as the opportunities offered by technology and artificial intelligence increase, digital assistants can also provide emotional support, which refers to empathetic, reassuring expressions for customers who have failed or succeeded in fulfilling a task. We show across four experiments that emotional support offered by a digital assistant increases customer satisfaction (Study 1 and 2) and persistence (Study 3 and 4) in using technology-mediated services. The increase in satisfaction occurs via the perceived warmth of the digital assistant, and the increase in persistence via the serial mediation of perceived warmth and satisfaction. Further, the results of a moderated serial mediation show that the effect on persistence only occurs when a digital (but not when a human) assistant provides emotional support in technology-mediated services. Finally, the effect of emotional support on persistence occurs independently of the digital assistant's embodiment. Practitioners learn how to imbue technology-mediated services with a human touch, inducing favorable customer outcomes. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

One such approach involves asking participants to inflict `harm' on a robot. Researchers are interested in the length of time between the experimenter issuing the instruction and the participant complying, and propose that relatively long periods of hesitation might reflect empathy for the robot, and perhaps even attribution of human-like qualities, such as agency and sentience. In a recent experiment, we adapted the so-called `hesitance to hit' paradigm, in which participants were instructed to hit a humanoid robot on the head with a mallet. After standing up to do so (signaling intent to hit the robot), participants were stopped, and then took part in a semi-structured interview to probe their thoughts and feelings during the period of hesitation. Thematic analysis of the responses indicate that hesitation not only reflects perceived socialness, but also other factors including (but not limited to) concerns about cost, mallet disbelief, processing of the task instruction, and the influence of authority. The open-ended, free responses participants provided also offer rich insights into individual differences with regards to anthropomorphism, perceived power imbalances, and feelings of connection toward the robot. In addition to aiding understanding of this measurement technique and related topics regarding socialness attribution to robots, we argue that greater use of open questions can lead to exciting new research questions and interdisciplinary collaborations in the domain of social robotics.","2021-02-25","2021-05-19 13:29:53","2021-05-19 13:29:53","","","","","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND Publisher: FRONTIERS MEDIA SA Type: Article","","","","","empathy; social robotics; qualitative research; human- robot interaction; prosocial behaviour; social perception","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, progress is not always followed by ethical reflection on its consequences or scientists' responsibility for their creations. The humanities can help health sciences students learn to critically analyse these issues; in particular, literature can aid discussions about ethical principles in biomedical research. Mary Shelley's Frankenstein; or, the modern Prometheus (1818) is an example of a classic novel presenting complex scenarios that could be used to stimulate discussion. Main text Within the framework of the 200th anniversary of the novel, we searched PubMed to identify works that explore and discuss its value in teaching health sciences. Our search yielded 56 articles, but only two of these reported empirical findings. Our analysis of these articles identified three main approaches to using Frankenstein in teaching health sciences: discussing the relationship between literature and science, analysing ethical issues in biomedical research, and examining the importance of empathy and compassion in healthcare and research. After a critical discussion of the articles, we propose using Frankenstein as a teaching tool to prompt students to critically analyse ethical aspects of scientific and technological progress, the need for compassion and empathy in medical research, and scientists' responsibility for their discoveries. Conclusion Frankenstein can help students reflect on the personal and social limits of science, the connection between curiosity and scientific progress, and scientists' responsibilities. Its potential usefulness in teaching derives from the interconnectedness of science, ethics, and compassion. Frankenstein can be a useful tool for analysing bioethical issues related to scientific and technological advances, such as artificial intelligence, genetic engineering, and cloning. Empirical studies measuring learning outcomes are necessary to confirm the usefulness of this approach.","2021-02-23","2021-05-19 13:29:53","2021-05-19 13:29:53","","","","1","22","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND Publisher: BMC Type: Article","","","","","Bioethics; Frankenstein; Health sciences; responsibility; Science fiction; Scientists&#8217; Teaching","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The emerging challenge now is the selection of most discriminative information from high-dimensional data collected from multiple sources. The available fusion algorithms with their complex structure are poorly adopted to the computationally constrained environment which requires integrating information directly at the source. As a result, more simple low-level fusion methods are needed. Objective: In the absence of a data combining process, the cost of directly applying high-dimensional raw data to a deep classifier would be computationally expensive with regard to the response time, energy consumption, and memory requirement. Taking this into account, we aimed to develop a data fusion technique in a computationally efficient way to achieve a more comprehensive insight of human activity dynamics in a lower dimension. The major objective was considering statistical dependency of multisensory data and exploring intermodality correlation patterns for different activities. Methods: In this technique, the information in time (regardless of the number of sources) is transformed into a 2D space that facilitates classification of eating episodes from others. This is based on a hypothesis that data captured by various sensors are statistically associated with each other and the covariance matrix of all these signals has a unique distribution correlated with each activity which can be encoded on a contour representation. These representations are then used as input of a deep model to learn specific patterns associated with specific activity. Results: In order to show the generalizability of the proposed fusion algorithm, 2 different scenarios were taken into account. These scenarios were different in terms of temporal segment size, type of activity, wearable device, subjects, and deep learning architecture. The first scenario used a data set in which a single participant performed a limited number of activities while wearing the Empatica E4 wristband. In the second scenario, a data set related to the activities of daily living was used where 10 different participants wore inertial measurement units while performing a more complex set of activities. The precision metric obtained from leave-one-subject-out cross-validation for the second scenario reached 0.803. The impact of missing data on performance degradation was also evaluated. Conclusions: To conclude, the proposed fusion technique provides the possibility of embedding joint variability information over different modalities in just a single 2D representation which results in obtaining a more global view of different aspects of daily human activities at hand, and yet preserving the desired performance level in activity recognition.","2021-01-28","2021-05-19 13:29:54","2021-05-19 13:29:54","","","","1","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 130 QUEENS QUAY E, STE 1102, TORONTO, ON M5A 0P6, CANADA Publisher: JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC Type: Article","","","","","deep learning; wearable sensors; image processing; covariance distribution; data fusion; food intake episode","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Goal conflicts can arise from simple trajectory planning to complex task prioritization. For successful human-robot goal-conflict resolution, humans and robots need to negotiate their goals and priorities. For this, the robot might be equipped with effective conflict resolution strategies to be assertive and effective but similarly accepted by the user. In this paper, conflict resolution strategies for service robots (public cleaning robot, home assistant robot) are developed by transferring psychological concepts (e.g., negotiation, cooperation) to HRI. Altogether, fifteen strategies were grouped by the expected affective outcome (positive, neutral, negative). In two online experiments, the acceptability of and compliance with these conflict resolution strategies were tested with humanoid and mechanic robots in two application contexts (public: n(1) = 61; private: n(2) = 93). To obtain a comparative value, the strategies were also applied by a human. As additional outcomes trust, fear, arousal, and valence, as well as perceived politeness of the agent were assessed. The positive/neutral strategies were found to be more acceptable and effective than negative strategies. Some negative strategies (i.e., threat, command) even led to reactance and fear. Some strategies were only positively evaluated and effective for certain agents (human or robot) or only acceptable in one of the two application contexts (i.e., approach, empathy). Influences on strategy acceptance and compliance in the public context could be found: acceptance was predicted by politeness and trust. Compliance was predicted by interpersonal power. Taken together, psychological conflict resolution strategies can be applied in HRI to enhance robot task effectiveness. If applied robot-specifically and context-sensitively they are accepted by the user. The contribution of this paper is twofold: conflict resolution strategies based on Human Factors and Social Psychology are introduced and empirically evaluated in two online studies for two application contexts. Influencing factors and requirements for the acceptance and effectiveness of robot assertiveness are discussed.","2021-01-26","2021-05-19 13:29:54","2021-05-19 13:29:54","","","","","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND Publisher: FRONTIERS MEDIA SA Type: Article","","","","","trust; persuasive robots; acceptance; HRI strategies; robot assertiveness; user compliance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we studied 92 journal articles to discover the trend of the ML utilisation in the study of EI and its components. This survey aims to pave way for future studies that could lead to implementation of ML in EI training, and to rope in researchers in psychology and computer science to find possibilities of having a generic ML algorithm for every EI's components. Our findings show an increasing trend to apply ML on EI components, and Support Vector Machine and Neural Network are the two most popular ML algorithms used in those researches.

Previous neuroimaging studies have indicated that neural responses of empathy for others' pain are modulated by an early automatic emotional sharing and a late controlled cognitive evaluation process. Recent studies about pain empathy for robots found humans present similar empathy process towards humanoid robots under painful stimuli as well as to humans. However, the whole-brain functional connectivity and the spatial dynamics of neural activities underlying empathic processes are still unknown. In the present study, the functional connectivity was investigated for ERPs recorded from 18 healthy adults who were presented with pictures of human hand and robot hand under painful and non-painful situations. Functional brain networks for both early and late empathy responses were constructed and a new parameter, empathy index (EI), was proposed to represent the empathy ability of humans quantitatively. We found that the mutual dependences between early ERP components was significantly decreased, but for the late components, there were no significant changes. The mutual dependences for human hand stimuli were larger than to robot hand stimuli for early components, but not for late components. The connectivity weights for early components were larger than late components. EI value shows significant difference between painful and non-painful stimuli, indicating it is a good indicator to represent the empathy of humans. This study enriches our understanding of the neurological mechanisms implicated in human empathy, and provides evidence of functional connectivity for both early and late responses of pain empathy towards humans and robots.","2021-01-22","2021-05-19 13:29:54","2021-05-19 13:29:54","","","","","151","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND Publisher: PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD Type: Article","","","","","EEG; Functional connectivity; Empathy; Human-robot interaction; Empathy index; Mutual information","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In social neuroscience, many experiments have sought to first define and then locate `perspective taking', `empathy', and other psychological concepts to specific brain circuits. Seldom, bottom-up studies were conducted to first identify explanatory patterns of brain variation, which are then related to psychological concepts; perhaps due to a lack of large population datasets. In this spirit, we performed a systematic de-construction of social brain morphology into its elementary building blocks, involving similar to 10,000 UK Biobank participants. We explored coherent representations of structural co-variation at population scale within a recent social brain atlas, by translating autoencoder neural networks from deep learning. The learned subnetworks revealed essential patterns of structural relationships between social brain regions, with the nucleus accumbens, medial prefrontal cortex, and temporoparietal junction embedded at the core. Some of the uncovered subnetworks contributed to predicting examined social traits in general, while other subnetworks helped predict specific facets of social functioning, such as the experience of social isolation. As a consequence of our population-level evidence, spatially overlapping subsystems of the social brain probably relate to interindividual differences in everyday social life. Kiesow et al. use deep learning to identify partially overlapping subnetworks in the human social brain at the population level. They also demonstrate that the learned subnetwork representations can be used to predict social traits.","2021-01-14","2021-05-19 13:29:55","2021-05-19 13:29:55","","","","1","4","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY Publisher: NATURE RESEARCH Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The problem in question is the limited use of heart rate (HR) as the prediction feature through the use of common classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Random Forest (RF) in emotion prediction. This paper aims to investigate whether HR signals can be utilized to classify four-class emotions using the emotion model from Russell's in a virtual reality (VR) environment using machine learning. Method An experiment was conducted using the Empatica E4 wristband to acquire the participant's HR, a VR headset as the display device for participants to view the 360 degrees emotional videos, and the Empatica E4 real-time application was used during the experiment to extract and process the participant's recorded heart rate. Findings For intra-subject classification, all three classifiers SVM, KNN, and RF achieved 100% as the highest accuracy while inter-subject classification achieved 46.7% for SVM, 42.9% for KNN and 43.3% for RF. Conclusion The results demonstrate the potential of SVM, KNN and RF classifiers to classify HR as a feature to be used in emotion prediction in four distinct emotion classes in a virtual reality environment. The potential applications include interactive gaming, affective entertainment, and VR health rehabilitation.","2021-01-07","2021-05-19 13:29:55","2021-05-19 13:29:55","","","","1","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND Publisher: SPRINGERNATURE Type: Article","","","","","Machine learning; Virtual reality; HR; SVM; Electrocardiography; KNN; Empatica E4; Four-class emotion classification; RF","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For this reason, designers in industrialised countries are required to create more innovative products/services whose novelty does not depend on their own original technology alone but on flexible resource integration among diverse actors. In order to design innovative products/services, empathy must be developed among diverse actors around the premise of the design. However, the ways to understand rationalities of each other is still unclear in extant research. As a result, diverse actors with heterogeneous rationalities fail to empathise to others, and designing innovative products/services as intended is difficult. To address this issue, this study aims to develop a practical method that achieve to understand the rationality of other actor in design innovative products/services. To achieve this, a context analysis method is proposed that captures the other actor's context in formalised procedure. The proposed method includes four steps: conducting an interview to extract information of context, modelling the context, understanding the context and carrying out the depth interview to understand a target actor's rationality completely based on the context modelling result. The proposed method was applied to therapy robot development, which is in its early stage of innovative service design. Moreover, the application result can encourage an actor to understand the other actor's rationality by utilising the proposed method.","2021","2021-05-19 13:29:55","2021-05-19 13:29:55","","","","2","15","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: Japan Soc Mech Engineers, Design & Syst Div; Japan Soc Mech Engineers, Mfg Syst Div; Japan Soc Mech Engineers Place: SHINANOMACHI-RENGAKAN BLDG., SHINANOMACHI 35, SHINJUKU-KU, TOKYO, 160-0016, JAPAN Publisher: JAPAN SOC MECHANICAL ENGINEERS Type: Article; Proceedings Paper","<p>International Conference on Design and Concurrent Engineering (JSME iDECON) / Manufacturing Systems Conference (MS), Tohoku Univ, Sendai, JAPAN, SEP 23-24, 2019</p>","","","","Empathy; Context modelling; Co-creation; Co-creative innovation; Context analysis; Design rationale; Synthesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, we communicate through dialogue and exchange emotions and information from it. Emotions are essential characteristics of natural language. Conversational artificial intelligence is an integral part of all the technologies that allow computers to communicate like humans. For a computer to interact like a human being, it must understand the emotions inherent in the conversation and generate the appropriate responses. However, existing dialogue systems focus only on improving the quality of understanding natural language or generating natural language, excluding emotions. We propose a chatbot based on emotion, which is an essential element in conversation. EP-Bot (an Empathetic PolarisX-based chatbot) is an empathetic chatbot that can better understand a person's utterance by utilizing PolarisX, an auto growing knowledge graph. PolarisX extracts new relationship information and expands the knowledge graph automatically. It is helpful for computers to understand a person's common sense. The proposed EP-Bot extracts knowledge graph embedding using PolarisX and detects emotion and dialog act from the utterance. Then it generates the next utterance using the embeddings. EP-Bot could understand and create a conversation, including the person's common sense, emotion, and intention. We verify the novelty and accuracy of EP-Bot through the experiments.","2021","2021-05-19 13:29:55","2021-05-19 13:29:55","","2807-2817","","3","67","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 871 CORONADO CENTER DR, SUTE 200, HENDERSON, NV 89052 USA Publisher: TECH SCIENCE PRESS Type: Article","","","","","emotion; conversational AI; Emotional chatbot; knowledge graph","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This new dynamic has caught the attention of political leaders who are finding ways to restrain or regulate Al in public services, but also of scholars who are raising legitimate concerns about its impacts on public employment. In light of the above, the aim of this research is to analyze the influence of Al on public employment and the ways politics are reacting. Design/Methodology/Approach: We have performed a systematic literature review to disclose the state-of-the-art and to find new avenues for future research. Results: The results indicate that public services require four kinds of intelligence - mechanical, analytical, intuitive, and empathetic - albeit, with much less expression than in private services. Limitations of the investigation: This systematic review provides a snapshot of the influence of AI on public employment. Thus, our research does not cover the whole body of knowledge, but it presents a holistic understanding of the phenomenon. Practical implications: As private companies are typically more advanced in the implementation of AI technologies, the for-profit sector may provide significant contributions in the way states can leverage public services through the deployment of AI technologies.

Collectively, these have resulted in the modification of the physician's role as the gatekeeper for health care, increased shift-based care, and amplified interprofessional team-based care. Technological innovations present opportunities as well as challenges. Artificial intelligence, which has great potential, has already transformed some tasks, particularly those involving image interpretation. Ubiquitous access to information via the Internet by physicians and patients alike presents benefits as well as drawbacks: patients and providers have ready access to virtually all of human knowledge, but some websites are contaminated with misinformation and many people have difficulty differentiating between solid, evidence-based data and untruths. The role of the future physician will shift as complexity in health care increases and as artificial intelligence and other technologies advance. These technological advances demand new skills of physicians; memory and knowledge accumulation will diminish in importance while information management skills will become more important. In parallel, medical educators must enhance their teaching and assessment of critical human skills (e.g., clear communication, empathy) in the delivery of patient care. The authors emphasize the enduring role of critical human skills in safe and effective patient care even as medical practice is increasingly guided by artificial intelligence and related technology, and they suggest new and longitudinal ways of assessing essential noncognitive skills to meet the demands of the future. The authors envision practical and achievable benefits accruing to patients and providers if practitioners leverage technological advancements to facilitate the development of their critical human skills.","2021-01","2021-05-19 13:29:56","2021-05-19 13:29:56","","37-43","","1","96","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA Publisher: LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Prosocial games are games focusing on helping others. Game researchers have been keen to investigate factors that influence the immersive experience in digital games. Previous studies show that VR allows people to take the perspective of others, inducing empathy and prosocial behaviour in the real world. In this lab-based study, we explore whether and how taking the perspective of other game characters - NPCs in a prosocial VR game - influences players' in-game empathy towards NPCs and game immersion. Participants first experienced either a robot's perspective of being destroyed by fire in VR or read a text description about the same event. Then, they participated a prosocial VR game in which they saved robots. The findings show that perspective-taking experiences indirectly enhance participants' game immersion via the effects of closeness with the destroyed robot and empathy towards the four robots protected by the player. This indirect effect is moderated by players' weekly exposure to video games. These results suggest that VR-based perspective-taking of NPCs can indirectly enhance gameplay experiences in prosocial VR games. Theoretical and game design implications are discussed.","","2021-05-19 13:29:56","2021-05-19 13:29:56","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND Publisher: TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD Type: Article; Early Access","","","","","empathy; virtual reality; digital games; Perspective taking; prosocial games","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Fair Play is an avatar-based role-playing video game in which Jamal Davis, a Black graduate student at a research university, navigates implicit forms of racial bias to reach the win-state of earning his PhD and becoming a professor. Fair Play was designed to educate players on the existence of racial bias in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine (STEMM) fields in an experiential way and to encourage perspective-taking. Research has found that taking the perspective of another can induce empathy, which improves the empathizer's attitudes towards individuals and groups. Paired with a facilitated workshop, Fair Play was also designed to teach bias concepts to increase participants' bias literacy. Intervention. Research on workshops to reduce gender bias suggests that it increased awareness of personal bias, the motivation and self-efficacy to practice bias-reducing strategies, and a more welcoming department climate and the hiring of more women faculty three years after the intervention. Capitalizing on these findings, a 3-hour workshop was developed to reduce race-based bias against Black/African Americans in STEMM using Fair Play. Conclusions. The facilitation of the workshops and Fair Play requires particular competencies due to its topic (racial bias) and player's skepticism about the reality of the bias incidents. Our data suggest that participants who identify as a person of color are more likely to believe that bias exists compared to White players, which can lead to a discussion about how the incidents in the game were designed and scripted. The facilitator also needs to be versed in a number of intentional design choices, such as Jamal not having voiceover and his success. Finally, this paper describes the Facilitator Game, which was developed as a complement to the game and allows a facilitator to jump to bias incidents quickly while debriefing and discussing the game to further participant learning.","","2021-05-19 13:29:56","2021-05-19 13:29:56","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 2455 ℡LER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA Publisher: SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC Type: Article; Early Access","","","","","Serious games; professional development; games for learning; social impact game","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This brain activity is further modulated by lowand high-order factors, e.g., the perceived intensity of the model's pain and the model's similarity with the onlooker, respectively. We investigated which specific aspect of similarity modulates such empathic reactivity, focusing on the potential differentiation between visual similarity and psychological closeness between the onlooker and different types of models. To this aim, we recorded fMRI data in neurotypical participants who observed painful and tactile stimuli delivered to an adult human hand, a baby human hand, a puppy dog paw, and an anthropomorphic robotic hand. The interaction between type of vicarious experience (pain, touch) and nature of model (adult, baby, dog, robot) showed that the right supramarginal gyrus (rSMG) was selectively active for visual similarity (more active during vicarious pain for the adult and baby models), while the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) was more sensitive to psychological closeness (specifically linked to vicarious pain for the baby model).

In human social interaction, the facial expression serves important communicative functions. We examined whether a robot's face is similarly important in human-robot communication. Based on emotion research and neuropsychological insights on the parallel processing of emotions, we argue that greater plasticity in the robot's face elicits higher affective responsivity, more closely resembling human-to-human responsiveness than a more static face. We conducted a between-subjects experiment of 3 (facial plasticity: human vs. facially flexible robot vs. facially static robot) x 2 (treatment: affectionate vs. maltreated). Participants (N = 265; M-age = 31.5) were measured for their emotional responsiveness, empathy, and attribution of feelings to the robot. Results showed empathically and emotionally less intensive responsivity toward the robots than toward the human but followed similar patterns. Significantly different intensities of feelings and attributions (e.g., pain upon maltreatment) followed facial articulacy. Theoretical implications for underlying processes in human-robot communication are discussed. We theorize that precedence of emotion and affect over cognitive reflection, which are processed in parallel, triggers the experience of `because I feel, I believe it's real,' despite being aware of communicating with a robot. By evoking emotional responsiveness, the cognitive awareness of `it is just a robot' fades into the background and appears not relevant anymore.","2020-12","2021-05-19 13:29:57","2021-05-19 13:29:57","","","","4","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND Publisher: MDPI Type: Article","","","","","empathy; social robots; facial expression; experiment; human-robot communication; user response","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Evidence indicates that OT effects on human behavior are multifaceted, such as trust behavior, decrease anxiety, empathy and bonding behavior. For the vital role of mentalizing in understanding others, here we examine whether OT has a general effect on mentalizing brain network which is associated to the effect of related social behavioral and personality traits. Using a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled group design, we investigate the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging after intranasal OT or placebo. The functional connectivity (FC) maps with seed in left/right temporoparietal junction (lTPJ/rTPJ) showed that OT significantly increased connectivity between rTPJ and default attention network (DAN), but decreased the FC between lTPJ and medial prefrontal network (MPN). With machine learning approach, we report that identified altered FCs of TPJ can classify OT and placebo (PL) group. Moreover, individual's empathy trait can modulate the FC between left TPJ and right rectus (RECT), which shows a positive correlation with empathic concern in PL group but a negative correlation in OT group. These results demonstrate that OT has significant effect on FC with lTPJ and rTPJ, brain regions where are critical for mentalizing, and the empathy concern can modulate the FC. These findings advance our understanding of the neural mechanisms by which OT modulates social behaviors, especially in social interaction involving mentalizing.","2020-12","2021-05-19 13:29:57","2021-05-19 13:29:57","","2530-2541","","6","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article","","","","","fMRI; Functional connectivity; Mentalizing network; Oxytocin; Temporoparietal junction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It seemed to have appropriated some of the key issues of the genre discourse - the question of what constitutes humanity, of the possibility of coexistence between humans and AI, of the problems of morality and consent. It also made use of time-honored devices of alternative history without treating it too seriously. Instead, the characters are enmeshed in personal problems and conundrums of science and politics, justice and empathy - and love. McEwan's commentary on the novel in various interviews only aggravated the critics who were all too ready to conclude that Machines Like Me offered little originality. This essay will demonstrate that the text is carefully layered as if to protect its own novelty hidden beneath rather conventional love triangle plot, ponderous political commentary, and genre-specific topicality. It will be an effort to understand the complex relation between the writer and conventions which come into play in his novel, and it will proceed to read the text against the authorial comments, finding suppressed hints that invite an interpretation of the text as narrated by its android hero rather than human subject.","","2021-05-19 13:29:57","2021-05-19 13:29:57","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND Publisher: ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD Type: Article; Early Access","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Robots offer the potential to provide healthcare support to patients both at home and in healthcare settings. However, in order for robots to be successfully implemented in these environments, they need to behave in ways that are appropriate and acceptable to human users. One way to identify appropriate social behaviours for healthcare robots is to model their behaviour on interactions between healthcare professionals and patients. This literature review aimed to inform healthcare robotics research by highlighting communication behaviours that are important within the context of healthcare. The review focussed on relevant research in human clinical interactions, followed by a review of similar factors in social robotics research. Three databases were searched for terms relating to healthcare professional communication behaviours associated with patient outcomes. The results identified key communication behaviours that can convey clinical empathy, including humour, self-disclosure, facial expressions, eye gaze, body posture, and gestures. A further search was conducted to identify research examining these key behaviours within the context of social and healthcare robotics. Research into these factors in human-robot interaction in healthcare is limited to date, and this review provides a useful guide for future research.","","2021-05-19 13:29:57","2021-05-19 13:29:57","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Review; Early Access","","","","","Communication; Human&#8211; robot interactions; Non-verbal behaviours; patient interactions; Physician&#8211; Verbal behaviours","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As an alternative, we will consider fostering empathy-related abilities through virtual embodiment in avatars. In the conclusion, however, we will examine some of the serious concerns related to the ethical relevance of empathy and will defend the philosophical case for a reason-guided empathy, also suggesting specific guidelines for possible future developments of empathy enhancement projects through VR embodied experiences.","2020-11-09","2021-05-19 13:29:57","2021-05-19 13:29:57","","","","","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND Publisher: FRONTIERS MEDIA SA Type: Article","","","","","empathy; virtual reality; applied ethics; empathy enhancement; moral enhancement; moral psychology; neuroethics; virtual embodiment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A plethora of warfighting games exist commercially, but there is a lack of digital games that deal with peace processes. Furthermore, none simulate actual peacekeeping. The United Nations currently deploys about 100,000 peacekeepers to some of the world's most dangerous zones, where peacekeepers save lives, alleviate suffering, and help create conditions for peace. The United Nations and national militaries lack peacekeeping simulations to help train their soldiers. Additionally, the public needs to learn more about the way peacekeeping works. Thus, peacekeeping simulation and gaming are worth exploring, especially in the rapidly evolving digital space, which offers new avenues and benefits. Methods. We review the meager literature on the subject and observe that there are few digital games to directly draw from. We build on previous work that argued the need for such development, but we now assess important design principles and parameters. We draw upon peacekeeping tabletop exercises that are already well developed. Results. We conclude that excellent scenarios and simulation technologies exist that could be combined quite easily for effective peacekeeping training and public education. We find key materials and scenarios in exercises of the United Nations and of the Pearson Peacekeeping Centre. Highlighted areas for future digital design are the inclusion of non-military avatars, emphasis on soft skills development (especially empathy), and realistically complex links between actions and consequences. Conclusion. While describing some UN exploration at a proof-of-concept stage, we suggest that both the United Nations and the gaming industry should explore the idea further to achieve synergies between institutional and entertainment applications. The growing capacity of digital technology allows significant innovation, yielding results that could be useful, ethical, enjoyable, and potentially profitable.","2021-04","2021-05-19 13:29:58","2021-05-19 13:29:58","","226-242","","2","52","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 2455 ℡LER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA Publisher: SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC Type: Article","","","","","empathy; digital games; peace operations; peace simulation; peacekeeping; stability operations; training < objective; United Nations; virtual gaming","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Materials and Methods: Co-design workshops with general practitioners were conducted. The workshops focused on (1) understanding the current consultation context and identifying existing problems, (2) ideating future solutions to these problems, and (3) discussing future roles for Al in primary care. The workshop activities included affinity diagramming, brainwriting, and video prototyping methods. The workshops were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Inductive thematic analysis of the transcripts of conversations was performed. Results: Two researchers facilitated 3 co-design workshops with 16 general practitioners. Three main themes emerged: professional autonomy, human-AI collaboration, and new models of care. Major implications identified within these themes included (1) concerns with medico-legal aspects arising from constant recording and accessibility of full consultation records, (2) future consultations taking place out of the exam rooms in a distributed system involving empowered patients, (3) human conversation and empathy remaining the core tasks of doctors in any future AI-enabled consultations, and (4) questioning the current focus of AI initiatives on improved efficiency as opposed to patient care. Conclusions: AI documentation assistants will likely to be integral to the future primary care consultations. However, these technologies will still need to be supervised by a human until strong evidence for reliable autonomous performance is available. Therefore, different human-AI collaboration models will need to be designed and evaluated to ensure patient safety, quality of care, doctor safety, and doctor autonomy.","2020-11","2021-05-19 13:29:58","2021-05-19 13:29:58","","1695-1704","","11","27","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND Publisher: OXFORD UNIV PRESS Type: Article","","","","","artificial intelligence; general practitioners; medical informatics; primary health care; qualitative study","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our objective is to contribute to the literature by exploring the pros and cons of the use of service robots in the hospitality industry and to practice, by presenting the architectural and technological characteristics of a fully automated plant based on a relevant case. To achieve such goal, this article uses a systematic literature review to assess the state-of-the-art, characterize the unit of analysis, and find new avenues for further research. The results indicate that, in high customer contact settings, service robots tend to outperform humans when performing standardized tasks, because of their mechanical and analytical nature. Evidence also shows that, in some cases, service robots have not yet achieved the desired technological maturity to proficiently replace humans. In other words, the technology is not quite there yet, but this does not contradict the fact that new robot technologies, enabled by AI, will be able to replace the employees' empathetic intelligence. In practical terms, organizations are facing challenges where they have to decide whether service robots are capable of completely replacing human labor or if they should rather invest in balanced options, such as human-robot systems, that seem to be a much more rational choice today.","2020-11","2021-05-19 13:29:58","2021-05-19 13:29:58","","","","","63","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND Publisher: ELSEVIER SCI LTD Type: Article","","","","","Artificial intelligence; Service robots; Empathetic intelligence; Hospitality industry; Service industry","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The effective service can be obtained through smooth, engaged, and humanoid interactions in which robots react properly to a user's affective state. This article proposes a novel Automatic Cognitive Empathy Model, ACEM, for humanoid robots to achieve longer and more engaged human-robot interactions (HRI) by considering humans' emotions and replying to them appropriately. The proposed model continuously detects the affective states of a user based on facial expressions and generates desired, either parallel or reactive, empathic behaviors that are already adapted to the user's personality. Users' affective states are detected using a stacked autoencoder network that is trained and tested on the RAVDESS dataset. The overall proposed empathic model is verified throughout an experiment, where different emotions are triggered in participants and then empathic behaviors are applied based on proposed hypothesis. The results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed model in terms of related social and friendship concepts that participants perceived during interaction with the robot.","2020-11","2021-05-19 13:29:58","2021-05-19 13:29:58","","","","3, SI","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 2 PENN PLAZA, STE 701, NEW YORK, NY 10121-0701 USA Publisher: ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY Type: Article","","","","","Empathy; social robots; human robot interaction; adaptive interaction; facial emotion detection; non-verbal behavior","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The researchers aim to gather practical knowledge regarding tourists' intentions for such service enhancements, which may drive the sector to adopt a better conclusive growth pattern in post-COVID-19 times. In this study, we attempt to focus on travelers who look for paramount safety with the assurance of empathetic, personalized care in post-COVID-19 times. In the current study, the authors employ structural equation modeling to evaluate the intentions of tourists both structurally and empirically for destination tourism with data collected from tourists with previous exposure to various kinds of these devices. The study shows that human-machine interactive devices are integrating AI and VR and have a significant effect on overall service quality, leading to tourist satisfaction and loyalty. The use of such social interactive gadgets within tourism and mostly in hospitality services requires an organization to make a commitment to futuristic technologies, along with building value by enriching service quality expectations among fearful tourists. This research shows that tourists mainly focus on the use of such HMI devices from the perspective of technology acceptance factors, qualitative value-enhancing service and trustworthy information-sharing mechanisms. The concept of the tour bubble framework is also discussed in detail. The analysis of this discussion gives us a more profound understanding of the novel opportunities which various administrative agencies may benefit from to position these devices better in smart, sustainable destination tourism strategies for the future so that, collectively, service 5.0 with HMI devices can possibly bring back tourism from being disintegrated. Such service applications are the new social innovations leading to sustainable service and a sophisticated experience for all tourists.","2020-11","2021-05-19 13:29:59","2021-05-19 13:29:59","","","","22","12","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND Publisher: MDPI Type: Article","","","","","COVID-19; 0 and 5; AI and VR devices; revival of tourism; robots in tourism; service 5; tour bubble; tourist interest; Web 4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we tested the effects of some socio-cognitive variables that could contribute to enhancing or reducing the implicit racial bias. The first aim of the study was to assess the beneficial effects of cooperation within a VR scenario, the second aim was to provide preliminary testing of the hypothesis that empathy and political attitudes could contribute to implicit bias about race, while the third aim was to explore the relationship between political attitudes and empathy. We had (Caucasian) participants embodied in a Black virtual body and engaged either in a cooperative (Coop group) or in a non-cooperative (Neutral group) activity with a confederate experimenter embodying another Black avatar. Before and after VR, we measured participants' implicit racial bias by means of Implicit Association Test (IAT) and their perceived closeness toward the confederate experimenter. Before VR we also assessed participants' political attitudes and empathy traits. Results revealed that, as compared to the Neutral group, the Coop group showed lower IAT scores after the social interaction. Interestingly, in the Neutral but not the Coop group the perceived closeness toward the confederate experimenter was associated with the initial racial bias: the more the participants reduced their distance, the more they reduced their IAT score. Moreover, reported traits of empathy and political attitudes significantly explained the variance observed in the initial implicit bias, with perspective-taking, empathic concern, and personal distress being significant predictors of the IAT scores. Finally, there was a relationship between political attitudes and empathy: the more participants considered themselves as left-wing voters, the higher their perspective-taking and empathic concern scores. We discuss these findings within the neuroscientific and social cognition field and encourage scholars from different domains to further explore whether and under which conditions a given manipulation for reducing racial bias could be efficiently transposed in VR.","2020-10-28","2021-05-19 13:29:59","2021-05-19 13:29:59","","","","","11","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND Publisher: FRONTIERS MEDIA SA Type: Article","","","","","empathy; virtual reality; embodiment; cooperation; implicit association test; implicit racial bias; inclusion of the other in the self; political attitudes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Robotic interventions have been explored for use with ASD children worldwide revealing that robots encourage one-to-one social and emotional interactions. However, associations between interpersonal synchronisation and emotional empathy have not yet been directly explored in French and Japanese ASD children when they interact with a human or a robot under analogous experimental conditions. Using the paradigm of actor-perceiver, where the child was the actor and the robot or the human the perceiver, we recorded the autonomic heart rate activation and reported emotional feelings of ASD children in both countries. Japanese and French ASD children showed different interpersonal synchronisation when they interacted with the human perceiver, even though the human was the same in both countries. However, they exhibited similar interpersonal synchronisation when the perceiver was the robot. The findings suggest that the mechanism combining interpersonal synchronisation and emotional empathy might be weakened but not absent in ASD children and that both French and Japanese ASD children do spontaneously and unconsciously discern non verbal actions of non human partners through a direct matching process that occurs via automatic mapping.","2020-10-15","2021-05-19 13:29:59","2021-05-19 13:29:59","","","","1","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY Publisher: NATURE RESEARCH Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper presents the experience of one aspect of artificial intelligence, machine learning, coupled with patient empathy to improve utilization of assisted reproductive technology (ART), which is an important aspect of care that is under-recognized. Although ART provides very effective options for infertile patients to build families, patients often discontinue ART when further treatment is likely to be beneficial and most of these patients do not achieve pregnancy without medical aid. Use of ART is only in part dependent on financial considerations; stress and other factors play a major role, as shown by high discontinuation rates despite reimbursement.

The survey measured opinions about the likelihood future technology would fully replace physicians in performing ten key psychiatric tasks. This study involved qualitative descriptive analysis of written responses (”comments”) to three open-ended questions in the survey. Results Comments were classified into four major categories in relation to the impact of future technology on: (1) patient-psychiatrist interactions; (2) the quality of patient medical care; (3) the profession of psychiatry; and (4) health systems. Overwhelmingly, psychiatrists were skeptical that technology could replace human empathy. Many predicted that `man and machine' would increasingly collaborate in undertaking clinical decisions, with mixed opinions about the benefits and harms of such an arrangement. Participants were optimistic that technology might improve efficiencies and access to care, and reduce costs. Ethical and regulatory considerations received limited attention. Conclusions This study presents timely information on psychiatrists' views about the scope of artificial intelligence and machine learning on psychiatric practice. Psychiatrists expressed divergent views about the value and impact of future technology with worrying omissions about practice guidelines, and ethical and regulatory issues.","2020-10","2021-05-19 13:30:00","2021-05-19 13:30:00","","","","","6","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND Publisher: SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD Type: Article","","","","","machine learning; Artificial intelligence; mental health; attitudes; future; opinions; psychiatry; qualitative research; technology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hundreds of genetic variants are expected to influence its complex development, but few have been identified. We used a machine learning method for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to uncover complex genotypic-phenotypic networks and environmental interactions. The Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) measured the self-regulatory components of personality critical for health (i.e., the character traits of self-directedness, cooperativeness, and self-transcendence). In a discovery sample of 2149 healthy Finns, we identified sets of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that cluster within particular individuals (i.e., SNP sets) regardless of phenotype. Second, we identified five clusters of people with distinct profiles of character traits regardless of genotype. Third, we found 42 SNP sets that identified 727 gene loci and were significantly associated with one or more of the character profiles. Each character profile was related to different SNP sets with distinct molecular processes and neuronal functions. Environmental influences measured in childhood and adulthood had small but significant effects. We confirmed the replicability of 95% of the 42 SNP sets in healthy Korean and German samples, as well as their associations with character. The identified SNPs explained nearly all the heritability expected for character in each sample (50 to 58%). We conclude that self-regulatory personality traits are strongly influenced by organized interactions among more than 700 genes despite variable cultures and environments. These gene sets modulate specific molecular processes in brain for intentional goal-setting, self-reflection, empathy, and episodic learning and memory.","2020-10","2021-05-19 13:30:00","2021-05-19 13:30:00","","2295-2312","","10","25","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND Publisher: SPRINGERNATURE Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Additionally, to learn and apply the correct behaviors, robots must be able to perceive and understand the affective states of humans. This study presents a framework to enable cognitive empathy in social robots, which uses facial emotion recognition to perceive and understand the affective states of human users. The perceived affective state is then provided to a reinforcement learning model to enable a robot to learn the most appropriate empathic behaviors for different states. The proposed framework has been evaluated through an experiment between 28 individual humans and the humanoid robot Pepper.

When this dyad is completed, mind attribution towards intentionally harmed liminal minds is enhanced. However, from a dehumanisation view, malevolent actions may instead result in a denial of humanness. To contrast both accounts, a visual vignette experiment (N = 253) depicted either malevolent or benevolent intentions towards robotic or human avatars. Additionally, we examined the role of harm-salience by showing patients as either harmed, or still unharmed. The results revealed significantly increased mind attribution towards visibly harmed patients, mediated by perceived pain and expressed empathy. Benevolent and malevolent intentions were evaluated respectively as morally right or wrong, but their impact on the patient was diminished for the robotic avatar. Contrary to dehumanisation predictions, our manipulation of intentions failed to affect mind perception. Nonetheless, benevolent intentions reduced dehumanisation of the patients. Moreover, when pain and empathy were statistically controlled, the effect of intentions on mind perception was mediated by dehumanisation. These findings suggest that perceived intentions might only be indirectly tied to mind perception, and that their role may be better understood when additionally accounting for empathy and dehumanisation.","2021-06","2021-05-19 13:30:00","2021-05-19 13:30:00","","454-465","","3","56","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: THE ATRIUM, SOUTHERN GATE, CHICHESTER PO19 8SQ, W SUSSEX, ENGLAND Publisher: JOHN WILEY & SONS LTD Type: Article","","","","","Robots; Benevolent intentions; Dehumanisation; Mind perception; Moral typecasting theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, the aim is to find out if social robots with empathetic voice are acceptable for users in healthcare applications. A pilot study using an empathetic voice spoken by a voice actor was conducted. Only prosody in speech is used to express empathy here, without any visual cues. Also, the emotions needed for an empathetic voice are identified. It was found that the emotions needed are not only the stronger primary emotions, but also the nuanced secondary emotions. These emotions are then synthesised using prosody modelling. A second study, replicating the pilot test is conducted using the synthesised voices to investigate if empathy is perceived from the synthetic voice as well. This paper reports the modelling and synthesises of an empathetic voice, and experimentally shows that people prefer empathetic voice for healthcare robots. The results can be further used to develop empathetic social robots, that can improve people's acceptance of social robots.","","2021-05-19 13:30:01","2021-05-19 13:30:01","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article; Early Access","","","","","Social robots; Artificial empathy; Emotional speech synthesis; Healthcare; Prosody modelling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we describe a study to evaluate the Adaptive Engine, which compares the benefit (i.e., reduced stress, increased rapport) of tailoring dialogue to the specific user (Adaptive group) with dialogues that are either empathic (Empathic group) or neutral (Neutral group). Results showed a significant reduction in stress in the empathic and neutral groups, but not the adaptive group. Analyses of rule accuracy, participants' dialogue preferences, and individual differences reveal that the three groups had different needs for empathic dialogue and highlight the importance and challenges of getting the tailoring right.","2020-09","2021-05-19 13:30:01","2021-05-19 13:30:01","","","","3","4","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND Publisher: MDPI Type: Article","","","","","intelligent virtual agents; human computer interaction; virtual humans; rapport; agent's expertise; study stress; user model; virtual advisor","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Users, on a restaurant guide site, utilize IDs to post their recommendation articles on restaurants, and these posted articles are a valuable information source for other users. Open users can search for restaurants and read recommendation articles posted by other users. Furthermore, they can react (e.g., “like”) to a recommendation article when they feel it is helpful or they feel like visiting the restaurant. On a target restaurant guide site, each post includes the user ID, restaurant name, recommendation sentences, etc., and the number of reactions is considered to depend on these posted contents. For users who post recommendation articles, the number of reactions to their posts represents the degree of empathy from other users and is an important motivation for posting. Therefore, posting users will benefit from guidelines on how to write good recommendation sentences to increase the number of reactions. Moreover, the number of reactions can be regarded as an important indicator of the activity level of the restaurant guide site from the viewpoint of the service operating company. Therefore, an analytical model developed using historical information such as posts and reactions by users would be useful for determining the relationship between posted contents and the number of reactions. Therefore, this paper proposes a model based on the machine learning approach to analyze the relation between the number of reactions and posted contents. Finally, we demonstrate the analysis based on the proposed model using practical data.","2020-09","2021-05-19 13:30:01","2021-05-19 13:30:01","","669-679","","3","19","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: VICTORIA BLDG RM 509, 705-1 YEOKSAM-DONG, KANGNAM-GU, SEOUL, 135-080, SOUTH KOREA Publisher: KOREAN INST INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERS Type: Article","","","","","Machine Learning; Natural Language Processing; Business Analytics; Restaurant Guide","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We investigated pain experiences when observing three different facial expressions of a virtual agent modeling affective minds (i.e., painful, unhappy, and neutral). The cold pain detection threshold of 19 healthy subjects was measured as they watched a black screen, then changes in their cold pain detection thresholds were evaluated as they watched the facial expressions. Subjects were asked to rate the pain intensity from the respective facial expressions. Changes of cold pain detection thresholds were compared and adjusted by the respective pain intensities. Only when watching the painful expression of a virtual agent did, the cold pain detection threshold increase significantly.

To explore the neural interactions among reward and memory circuits, we applied effective connectivity analysis on resting-state fMRI data collected from cocaine-dependent subjects. The relationship between effective connectivity within these two important circuits and empathy ability - evaluated with the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) - was assessed by machine learning algorithm using multivariate regression analysis. In accordance with the neurocircuitry disruptions of cocaine addiction, the results showed that cocaine-dependent subjects relative to healthy controls had altered resting state effective connectivity between parts of the memory and reward systems. Furthermore, effective connectivity between the memory and reward system could predict the fantasy empathy (FE) subscale scores in cocaine dependence. Overall, our findings provide further evidence for the neural substrates of social cognition in cocaine-dependent patients.

Existing humanoid robots can exhibit rudimentary forms of empathy; as these machines slowly become commonplace in healthcare settings, they will be expected to express empathy as a natural function, rather than merely to portray artificial empathy as a replication of human empathy. This article works with a twofold purpose: firstly, to consider the impact of artificial empathy in nursing and, secondly, to describe the influence of Affective Developmental Robotics (ADR) in anticipation of the empathic behaviour presented by artificial humanoid robots. The ADR has demonstrated that it can be one means by which humanoid nurse robots can achieve expressions of more relatable artificial empathy. This will be one of the vital models for intelligent humanoid robots currently in nurse robot development for the healthcare industry. A discussion of IHRs demonstrating artificial empathy is critical to nursing practice today, particularly in healthcare settings dense with technology.","2020-10","2021-05-19 13:30:02","2021-05-19 13:30:02","","","","4","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article","","","","","artificial intelligence; affective developmental robotics; artificial empathy; humanoid nurse robots; intelligent humanoid robots; nursing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Some researchers have argued that AI will augment the capacities of physicians and increase their availability to provide empathy and other uniquely human forms of care to their patients. The human vulnerabilities experienced in the healthcare context raise the stakes of new technologies such as AI, and the human dimensions of AI in healthcare have particular significance for research in the humanities. This article explains four key areas of concern relating to AI and the role that medical/health humanities research can play in addressing them: definition and regulation of “medical” versus “health” data and apps; social determinants of health; narrative medicine; and technological mediation of care. Issues include data privacy and trust, flawed datasets and algorithmic bias, racial discrimination, and the rhetoric of humanism and disability. Through a discussion of potential humanities contributions to these emerging intersections with AI, this article will suggest future scholarly directions for the field.","","2021-05-19 13:30:03","2021-05-19 13:30:03","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article; Early Access","","","","","Natural language processing; Big data; Digital health; Health technology; Narrative medicine; Social determinants of health","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Caring is a fundamental characteristic, expectation, and moral obligation of the nursing and caregiving professions (Nursing: Scope and standards of practice, American Nurses Association, Silver Spring, MD, 2015). Along with caring, nurses are expected to undertake ever-expanding duties and complex tasks. In part because of the growing physical, intellectual and emotional demandingness, of nursing as well as technological advances, artificial intelligence (AI) and AI care robots are rapidly changing the healthcare landscape. As technology becomes more advanced, efficient, and economical, opportunities and pressure to introduce AI into nursing care will only increase. In the first part of the article, we review recent and existing applications of AI in nursing and speculate on future use. Second, situate our project within the recent literature on the ethics of nursing and AI. Third, we explore three dominant theories of caring and the two paradigmatic expressions of caring (touch and presence) and conclude that AI-at least for the foreseeable future-is incapable of caring in the sense central to nursing and caregiving ethics. We conclude that for AI to be implemented ethically, it cannot transgress the core values of nursing, usurp aspects of caring that can only meaningfully be carried out by human beings, and it must support, open, or improve opportunities for nurses to provide the uniquely human aspects of care.","2020-10","2021-05-19 13:30:03","2021-05-19 13:30:03","","","","4","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article","","","","","artificial intelligence; ethics; nursing; robotics; ethics of caring","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Dick'sDo androids dream of electric sheep?","NEOHELICON","","0324-4652","10.1007/s11059-020-00544-z","","The official definition for alexithymia dates back to 1973, when Sifneos described its symptoms. Persons affected by this condition are unable to verbally describe their feelings. For many years this condition was relatively little known, but nowadays people are talking about it more and more. In forums in which the patients' comments are posted, it is often underscored how this particular mental state is similar to that of the androids described in the novelDo androids dream of electric sheep? by Philip K. Dick. The Dickian clinical references were those in use during the 1960s. Therefore, to special characteristics that Philip Dick attributed to his robots (coldness and lack of human empathy, and simultaneous desire for social acceptance), the writer, and then the critics, assigned the label of schizophrenia, the only one that the psychiatric manuals of that time associated to such symptoms. Today, if Dick were alive and were to write about his androids, he most likely would no longer use the term schizophrenics, but instead the term alexithymics, which are more socially adaptive than schizophrenics, just like his androids. Making retrospective diagnoses of literary characters is anachronistic; as it was done for decades by critics to consider the Dickian androids schizophrenics: in the fiction story they are not schizophrenics but robots. However a new psychological trait such as alexithymia can revisit that same story by giving it a new symbolic meaning. The aims of this article are: to highlight how the old nosological categories of schizophrenia, generally referred to when commentingDo androids dream of electric sheep?, should be supplemented by the category of alexithymia; to analyze the scenes in which the characters have typical alexithymic behaviors, trying to prove that alexithymia is actually best suited for describing the androids invented by Dick.","2020-12","2021-05-19 13:30:03","2021-05-19 13:30:03","","673-683","","2, SI","47","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article","","","","","Schizophrenia; Affective disorders; Alexithymia; Dick; Do androids dream of electric sheep?; Philip K","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Automated machine learning classification of wearable biosensor signals requires quantitative measures of signal quality to automatically reject poor-quality or corrupt data segments. In this study, commercially available wearable sensors were placed on patients with epilepsy undergoing in-hospital or in-home electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring, and healthy volunteers. Empatica E4 and Biovotion Everion were used to record accelerometry (ACC), photoplethysmography (PPG), and electrodermal activity (EDA). Byteflies Sensor Dots were used to record ACC and PPG, the Activinsights GENEActiv watch to record ACC, and Epitel Epilog to record EEG data. PPG and EDA signals were recorded for multiple days, then epochs of high-quality, marginal-quality, or poor-quality data were visually identified by reviewers, and reviewer annotations were compared to automated signal quality measures. For ACC, the ratio of spectral power from 0.8 to 5 Hz to broadband power was used to separate good-quality signals from noise. For EDA, the rate of amplitude change and prevalence of sharp peaks significantly differentiated between good-quality data and noise. Spectral entropy was used to assess PPG and showed significant differences between good-, marginal-, and poor-quality signals. EEG data were evaluated using methods to identify a spectral noise cutoff frequency. Patients were asked to rate the usability and comfort of each device in several categories. Patients showed a significant preference for the wrist-worn devices, and the Empatica E4 device was preferred most often. Current wearable devices can provide high-quality data and are acceptable for routine use, but continued development is needed to improve data quality, consistency, and management, as well as acceptability to patients.","2020-11","2021-05-19 13:30:03","2021-05-19 13:30:03","","S25-S35","","1, SI","61","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article","","","","","epilepsy; patient experience; signal quality; wearable devices","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, via structural equation modelling (SEM) and semi-structured interviews with managers, we conceptualise and empirically test visitors' intentions to use social robots in hospitality services. With data collected in Singapore's hospitality settings, we found visitors' intentions to use social robots stem from the effects of technology acceptance variables, service quality dimensions leading to perceived value, and two further dimensions from human robot interaction (HRI): empathy and information sharing. Analysis of these dimensions' importance provides a deeper understanding of novel opportunities managers may take advantage of to position social robot-delivered services in tourism and hospitality strategies.","2020-06","2021-05-19 13:30:04","2021-05-19 13:30:04","","","","","78","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND Publisher: ELSEVIER SCI LTD Type: Article","","","","","Artificial intelligence; Human-robot interaction; Hospitality services; Intention to use robots; Social robots","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Online mental health forums can provide a supportive environment for those afflicted and also generate a large amount of data that can be mined to predict mental health states using machine learning methods. Objective: This study aimed to benchmark multiple methods of text feature representation for social media posts and compare their downstream use with automated machine learning (AutoML) tools. We tested on datasets that contain posts labeled for perceived suicide risk or moderator attention in the context of self-harm. Specifically, we assessed the ability of the methods to prioritize posts that a moderator would identify for immediate response. Methods: We used 1588 labeled posts from the Computational Linguistics and Clinical Psychology (CLPsych) 2017 shared task collected from the Reachout.com forum. Posts were represented using lexicon-based tools, including Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner, Empath, and Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count, and also using pretrained artificial neural network models, including DeepMoji, Universal Sentence Encoder, and Generative Pretrained Transformer-1 (GPT-1). We used Tree-based Optimization Tool and Auto-Sklearn as AutoML tools to generate classifiers to triage the posts. Results: The top-performing system used features derived from the GPT-1 model, which was fine-tuned on over 150,000 unlabeled posts from Reachout.com . Our top system had a macroaveraged F1 score of 0.572, providing a new state-of-the-art result on the CLPsych 2017 task. This was achieved without additional information from metadata or preceding posts. Error analyses revealed that this top system often misses expressions of hopelessness. In addition, we have presented visualizations that aid in the understanding of the learned classifiers. Conclusions: In this study, we found that transfer learning is an effective strategy for predicting risk with relatively little labeled data and noted that fine-tuning of pretrained language models provides further gains when large amounts of unlabeled text are available.","2020-05-13","2021-05-19 13:30:04","2021-05-19 13:30:04","","","","5","22","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 130 QUEENS QUAY E, STE 1102, TORONTO, ON M5A 0P6, CANADA Publisher: JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC Type: Article","","","","","machine learning; mental health; classification; natural language processing; social support; data interpretation; statistical; transfer learning; triage","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This article analyzes the impact of strategic stability of the use of AI in the strategic decision-making process, in particular, the risks and trade-offs of pre-delegating military force (or automating escalation) to machines. It argues that AI-enabled decision support tools, by substituting the role of human critical thinking, empathy, creativity, and intuition in the strategic decision-making process, will be fundamentally destabilizing if defense planners come to view AI's `support' function as a panacea for the cognitive fallibilities and human analysis and decision-making. The article also considers the nefarious use of AI-enhanced fake news, deepfakes, bots, and other forms of social media by non-state actors and state proxy actors, which might cause states to exaggerate a threat from ambiguous or manipulated information, increasing instability.","","2021-05-19 13:30:04","2021-05-19 13:30:04","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND Publisher: ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD Type: Article; Early Access","","","","","Artificial intelligence; -China relations; deterrence policy; emerging technology; nuclear security; strategic stability; S; U","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this work, we aim to examine AI roles in early design stages. The human ideation components and design tools related to AI are discussed in a framework of AI-augmented design support. The framework develops a hierarchy of design cognition (basis), approaches and principles. The cognitive models are constructed in an empirical study of 30 designers (26 for analysis, 4 for pilot study) by concurrent Think-Aloud protocol and behavior analysis. The process of producing new design ideas is explained by a transparent analysis of designers' language and behaviors. Three strategies to organize cognitive activities in design ideation are summarized: develop structured consideration, relate to a scenario, and stick-to designing. These strategies suggest AI could act as (1) representation creation, (2) empathy trigger and (3) engagement, in principles of “knowledge-driven” and “decompose-and-integrate”. The design support with AI provides new perspectives on computer-based design tools that limit to well-defined design variables. The framework is built on a generic notion of design activity and “mimic” human design rationales, expected to benefit research of domain-independent computational design supports and cognitive supports.","2020-11-01","2021-05-19 13:30:05","2021-05-19 13:30:05","","511-544","","5-6","35","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA Publisher: TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC Type: Article","","","","","artificial intelligence; design supports; Human computer interaction theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The epistemological approach helps us to clarify whether we can empathize with artificial intelligence or, more precisely, with social robots. The main puzzle here concerns, among other things, exactly what it is that we empathize with if robots do not have emotions or beliefs, since they do not have a consciousness in an elaborate sense. However, by comparing robots with fictional characters, the paper shows that we can still empathize with robots and that many of the existing accounts of empathy and mindreading are compatible with such a view. By so doing, the paper focuses on the significance of perspective-taking and claims that we also ascribe to robots something like a perspectival experience. The normative approach examines the moral impact of empathizing with robots. In this regard, the paper critically discusses three possible responses: strategic, anti-barbarizational, and pragmatist. The latter position is defended by stressing that we are increasingly compelled to interact with robots in a shared world and that to take robots into our moral consideration should be seen as an integral part of our self- and other-understanding.","2020-12","2021-05-19 13:30:05","2021-05-19 13:30:05","","881-897","","4","11","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article","","","","","Ethics; Artificial intelligence; Empathy; Fictional characters; Humanoid robots; Interaction; Perspective-taking","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Socially-assistive robots (SAR) have been used to reduce pain and distress in children in medical settings. Patients who perceive empathic treatment have increased satisfaction and improved outcomes. We sought to determine if an empathic SAR could be developed and used to decrease pain and fear associated with peripheral IV placement in children. Methods. We conducted a pilot study of children receiving IV placement. Participating children were randomized to interact with (1) no robot, or a commercially available 3D printed humanoid SAR robot programmed with (2) empathy or (3) distraction conditions. Children and parents completed demographic surveys, and children used an adapted validated questionnaire to rate the robot's empathy on an 8-point Likert scale. Survey scores were compared by the t-test or chi-square test. Pain and fear were measured by self-report using the FACES and FEAR scales, and video tapes were coded using the CHEOPS and FLACC. Scores were compared using repeated measures 2-way ANOVA. This trial is registered with . Results. Thirty-one children with an average age of 9.6 years completed the study. For all measures, mean pain and fear scores were lowest in the empathy group immediately before and after IV placement. Children were more likely to attribute characteristics of empathy to the empathic condition (Likert score 7.24 v. 4.70; p=0.012) and to report that having the empathic vs. distraction robot made the IV hurt less (7.45 vs. 4.88; p=0.026). Conclusions. Children were able to identify SAR designed to display empathic characteristics and reported it helped with IV insertion pain and fear. Mean scores of self-reported or objective pain and fear scales were the lowest in the empathy group and the highest in the distraction condition before and after IV insertion. This result suggests empathy improves SAR functionality when used for painful medical procedures and informs future research into SAR for pain management.","2020-04-09","2021-05-19 13:30:05","2021-05-19 13:30:05","","","","","2020","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND Publisher: HINDAWI LTD Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A mobile health intervention utilizing a fully automated text-based health care chatbot (TBHC) may offer an innovative way not only to deliver coping strategies and psychoeducation for pain management but also to build a working alliance between a participant and the TBHC. Objective: The objectives of this study are twofold: (1) to describe the design and implementation to promote the chatbot painSELfMAnagement (SELMA), a 2-month smartphone-based cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) TBHC intervention for pain self-management in patients with ongoing or cyclic pain, and (2) to present findings from a pilot randomized controlled trial, in which effectiveness, influence of intention to change behavior, pain duration, working alliance, acceptance, and adherence were evaluated. Methods: Participants were recruited online and in collaboration with pain experts, and were randomized to interact with SELMA for 8 weeks either every day or every other day concerning CBT-based pain management (n=59), or weekly concerning content not related to pain management (n=43). Pain-related impairment (primary outcome), general well-being, pain intensity, and the bond scale of working alliance were measured at baseline and postintervention. Intention to change behavior and pain duration were measured at baseline only, and acceptance postintervention was assessed via self-reporting instruments. Adherence was assessed via usage data. Results: From May 2018 to August 2018, 311 adults downloaded the SELMA app, 102 of whom consented to participate and met the inclusion criteria. The average age of the women (88/102, 86.4%) and men (14/102, 13.6%) participating was 43.7 (SD 12.7) years. Baseline group comparison did not differ with respect to any demographic or clinical variable. The intervention group reported no significant change in pain-related impairment (P=.68) compared to the control group postintervention. The intention to change behavior was positively related to pain-related impairment (P=.01) and pain intensity (P=.01). Working alliance with the TBHC SELMA was comparable to that obtained in guided internet therapies with human coaches. Participants enjoyed using the app, perceiving it as useful and easy to use. Participants of the intervention group replied with an average answer ratio of 0.71 (SD 0.20) to 200 (SD 58.45) conversations initiated by SELMA. Participants' comments revealed an appreciation of the empathic and responsible interaction with the TBHC SELMA. A main criticism was that there was no option to enter free text for the patients' own comments. Conclusions: SELMA is feasible, as revealed mainly by positive feedback and valuable suggestions for future revisions. For example, the participants' intention to change behavior or a more homogenous sample (eg, with a specific type of chronic pain) should be considered in further tailoring of SELMA.","2020-04-03","2021-05-19 13:30:05","2021-05-19 13:30:05","","","","4","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 130 QUEENS QUAY E, STE 1102, TORONTO, ON M5A 0P6, CANADA Publisher: JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC Type: Article","","","","","chatbot; conversational agent; health care; digital health; chronic pain; cognitive behavior therapy; pain self-management; psychoeducation; smartphone; text-based","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The assessment of our psychological traits is a useful tool when we require them to simulate empathy. Since the creation of social media platforms, numerous studies dealt with measuring personality traits by gathering users' information from their social media profiles. Real world applications showed how natural language processing combined with supervised machine learning algorithms are effective in this field. These applications have some limitations such as focusing on English text only and not considering polysemy in text. In this paper, we propose a multilingual model that handles polysemy by analyzing sentences as a semantic ensemble of interconnected words. The proposed approach processes Facebook posts from the myPersonality dataset and it turns them into a high-dimensional array of features, which are then exploited by a deep neural network architecture based on transformer to perform regression. We prove the effectiveness of our work by comparing the mean squared error of our model with existing baselines and the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the relative data distributions. We obtained state-of-the-art results in personality traits estimation from social media posts for all five personality traits.","2020-04","2021-05-19 13:30:06","2021-05-19 13:30:06","","","","4","11","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND Publisher: MDPI Type: Article","","","","","deep learning; affective computing; natural language processing; Big 5; multilingual embeddings; personality dimensions; sentence embeddings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In recent years, the quest for greater efficiency in health care, including economic efficiency, has often resulted in the side-lining of these values, making it difficult for health-care professionals to incorporate them in practice. Artificial intelligence is increasingly being used in health care. This technology promises greater efficiency and more free time for health-care professionals to focus on the human side of care, including fostering trust relationships and engaging with patients with empathy and compassion. This article considers the vision of efficient, empathetic and trustworthy health care put forward by the proponents of artificial intelligence. The paper suggests that artificial intelligence has the potential to fundamentally alter the way in which empathy, compassion and trust are currently regarded and practised in health care. Moving forward, it is important to re-evaluate whether and how these values could be incorporated and practised within a health-care system where artificial intelligence is increasingly used. Most importantly, society needs to re-examine what kind of health care it ought to promote.","2020-04","2021-05-19 13:30:06","2021-05-19 13:30:06","","245-250","","4","98","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: MARKETING AND DISSEMINATION, CH-1211 GENEVA 27, SWITZERLAND Publisher: WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In near future, Al is likely to take a central place in health care with everything revolving round its mechanics. The era of Al envisages new roles of a physician and health professionals should realise the importance of being efficient in interacting with these machines in an efficient manner. Patient psychology and empathy shall take a central place in patient care and budding doctors should be braced with such relevant competencies.

We take into account both intelligent quotient and emotional quotient in system design, cast human-machine social chat as decision-making over Markov Decision Processes, and optimize XiaoIce for long-term user engagement, measured in expected Conversation-turns Per Session (CPS). We detail the system architecture and key components, including dialogue manager, core chat, skills, and an empathetic computing module. We show how XiaoIce dynamically recognizes human feelings and states, understands user intent, and responds to user needs throughout long conversations. Since the release in 2014, XiaoIce has communicated with over 660 million active users and succeeded in establishing long-term relationships with many of them.

The aim of such projects, of which the DREAM project is an example, is to replace therapists by robots, operating in sensory environments that enable them to detect and respond to feedback from the child. This article considers the ethical concerns of autonomy, community, transparency, identity, value, and empathy to evaluate the ethics of such deployment of robots. In doing so it provides a response to the Richardson et al. article in IEEE Technology and Society Magazine, Mar. 2018 [20]. This article concludes that deployment of robots to control the behavior of autistic children is ethically suspect and should be questioned. The use of robots with children should be evaluated on the basis of the purpose of and process by which such robots are deployed, rather than on the basis of the technology itself. Particularly important is the roboticist's empathy with the user of the robot, and gaining an understanding of the individual child. The paper suggests how an understanding of the autistic child might lead to sensitive deployment of a robot to help the child manage social environments through supporting the child's regulation of emotions.","2020-03","2021-05-19 13:30:07","2021-05-19 13:30:07","","51-60","","1","39","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA Publisher: IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC Type: Article","","","","","Medical treatment; Ethics; Robot sensing systems; Autism; Pediatrics; Social implications of technology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Specifically, we vary levels of interaction fidelity to investigate how responsiveness and behavioural realism affect people's experience of interacting with virtual humans. This is accomplished through the creation of Cinemacraft, a technology-mediated immersive platform for collaborative human-computer interaction. Cinemacraft leverages a voxel game engine similar to Minecraft to facilitate collaborative interaction in a virtual 3D world and incorporates sensory fusion to improve the fidelity of real-time collaboration. The primary hypothesis of the study is that embodied interactions result in a higher degree of presence, and that sensory fusion can improve the quality of presence and co-presence. We tested our hypothesis through a user-study of 24 participants. Based on suggestions from existing literature, we sidestep the uncanny valley effect through the use of low fidelity avatars (a la Minecraft) and identify cues that impact users ratings of presence, co-presence and successful collaboration. The findings and ensuing data in this research can be applied to produce a more compelling platform for live collaborative interactions, performances, and empathetic storytelling. This research contributes to the field of immersive, collaborative interaction by making transparent the platform, methodology, instruments and code accessible for team members with less technological expertise, as well as developers aspiring to use interactive 3D media to promote further experimentation and conceptual discussions.","2020-03","2021-05-19 13:30:07","2021-05-19 13:30:07","","53-73","","1","24","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 236 GRAYS INN RD, 6TH FLOOR, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND Publisher: SPRINGER LONDON LTD Type: Article","","","","","Information systems; Software engineering; Computing methodologies; Motion capture; Virtual worlds software","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Much of teen stress stems from school, making the school environment an ideal location for a stress reducing technology. The goal of this mixed-methods study was to understand teens' operation of, and responsiveness to, a robot only capable of movement compared to a robot only capable of speech. Stemming from a human-centered approach, we introduce a Participatory Wizard of Oz (PWoz) interaction method that engaged teens as operators, users, and witnesses in a uniquely transparent interaction. In this paper, we illustrate the use of the PWoz interaction method as well as how it helps identify engaging robot interactions. Using this technique, we present results from a study with 62 teens that includes details of the complexity of teen stress and a significant reduction in negative attitudes toward robots after interactions. We analyzed the teens' interactions with both the verbal and non-verbal robots and identified strong themes of (1) authenticity, (2) empathy, (3) emotional engagement, and (4) imperfection creates connection.

An untested implication of this hypothesis is that these stable patterns of connectivity should be visible even in the absence of empathy tasks. Using machine learning, we demonstrate that patterns of resting state fMRI connectivity (i.e. the degree of synchronous BOLD activity across multiple cortical areas in the absence of explicit task demands) of resonance and control networks predict trait empathic concern (n = 58). Empathic concern was also predicted by connectivity patterns within the somatomotor network. These findings further support the role of resonance-control network interactions and of somatomotor function in our vicariously driven concern for others. Furthermore, a practical implication of these results is that it is possible to assess empathic predispositions in individuals without needing to perform conventional empathy assessments.","2020-02-14","2021-05-19 13:30:08","2021-05-19 13:30:08","","","","","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND Publisher: FRONTIERS MEDIA SA Type: Article","","","","","fMRI; resting state; machine learning; connectivity; empathy; empathic concern; experience sharing; mirroring","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Participants watched two supposed human players who were modelled as having a strong (player LP) or weak (player NLP) tendency to lead in social situations executing penalty shots in a virtual reality robot soccer game. As predicted, empathic response were modulated by shared behavioural traits: participants whose tendency to lead was more similar to player LP's tendency to lead experienced more reward, and showed stronger neural activity in reward-related brain regions, when they saw player LP score a goal, and participants whose tendency to lead was more similar to player NLP's tendency to lead showed stronger empathic responses when they saw player NLP score a goal.

This assessment, run entirely on a tablet, measures decision-making via a suite of neurocognitive tests in less than 30 minutes. The software measures several cognitive and decision-making traits of the user, including impulsivity, empathy, aggression, and several other traits linked to reoffending. Our analysis measured whether this assessment successfully predicted recidivism by testing probationers in a large urban city (Houston, TX, United States) from 2017 to 2019. To determine predictive validity, we used machine learning to yield cross-validated receiver-operator characteristics. Results gave a recidivism prediction value of 0.70, making it comparable to commonly used risk assessments. This novel approach diverges from traditional self-reporting, interview-based, and criminal-records-based approaches, and can also add a protective layer against bias, while strengthening model accuracy in predicting reoffense. In addition, subjectivity is eliminated and time-consuming administrative efforts are reduced. With continued data collection, this approach opens the possibility of identifying different levels of recidivism risk, by crime type, for any age, or gender, and seeks to steer individuals appropriately toward rehabilitative programs.

To deal with these adverse effects, socially excluded individuals frequently turn to other humans for emotional support. While chatbots can elicit social and emotional responses on the part of the human interlocutor, their effectiveness in the context of social exclusion has not been investigated. In the present study, we examined whether an empathic chatbot can serve as a buffer against the adverse effects of social ostracism. After experiencing exclusion on social media, participants were randomly assigned to either talk with an empathetic chatbot about it (e.g., “I'm sorry that this happened to you”) or a control condition where their responses were merely acknowledged (e.g., “Thank you for your feedback”). Replicating previous research, results revealed that experiences of social exclusion dampened the mood of participants. Interacting with an empathetic chatbot, however, appeared to have a mitigating impact. In particular, participants in the chatbot intervention condition reported higher mood than those in the control condition.

This is particularly true in the case of high impact events, such as the Parkland school shooting in Florida. This paper approaches the analysis of high impact events in two ways. First, tweet sentiment analysis using the NLTK machine learning standard with TextBlob is applied.

In a market-driven context, current approaches to collect and analyze users' feedback are based on techniques leveraging information extracted from product reviews and social media. These approaches are hardly applicable in bespoke software development, or in contexts in which one needs to gather information from specific users. In such cases, companies need to resort to face-to-face interviews to get feedback on their products. In this paper, we propose to utilize biofeedback to complement interviews with information about the engagement of the user on the discussed features and topics. We evaluate our approach by interviewing users while gathering their biometric data using an Empatica E4 wristband. Our results show that we can predict users' engagement by training supervised machine learning algorithms on the biometric data. The results of our work can be used to facilitate the prioritization of product features and to guide the interview based on users' engagement.","2020","2021-05-19 13:30:09","2021-05-19 13:30:09","","32-43","","","","","","","International Requirements Engineering Conference","","","","IEEE","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: IEEE; IEEE Comp Soc; Univ Zurich; Tech Council Software Engn; Univ Appl Sci & Arts NW Switzerland, Inst Interact Technologies; ACM In Cooperat; Special Interest Grp Software Engn ISSN: 2332-6441 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>28th IEEE International Requirements Engineering Conference (RE), Zurich, SWITZERLAND, AUG 31-SEP 04, 2020</p>","","","","","Breaux, T and Zisman, A and Fricker, S and Glinz, M","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There is a small number of counseling chatbots for victims of sexual crime, but none targeting teenagers specifically. This research suggests design guidelines for building a counseling chatbot for teenage victims of online sexual exploitation with a focus on establishing rapport by empathizing with their stories and providing them with the proper information. We conducted in-depth interviews with peer counselors at the Teenage Women's Human Rights Center, who have been consulting teenage victims in their age group using online messengers.

Unfair reviews, created when requesters consider factors outside of a worker's control, are known to plague gig workers and can result in lost job opportunities and even termination from the marketplace. Our tool leverages machine learning to implement an intelligent interface that: (1) uses deep learning to automatically detect when an individual has included unfair factors into her review (factors outside the worker's control per the policies of the market); and (2) prompts the individual to reconsider her review if she has incorporated unfair factors. To study the effectiveness of Reputation Agent, we conducted a controlled experiment over different gig markets. Our experiment illustrates that across markets, Reputation Agent, in contrast with traditional approaches, motivates requesters to review gig workers' performance more fairly. We discuss how tools that bring more transparency to employers about the policies of a gig market can help build empathy thus resulting in reasoned discussions around potential injustices towards workers generated by these interfaces. Our vision is that with tools that promote truth and transparency we can bring fairer treatment to gig workers.","2020","2021-05-19 13:30:11","2021-05-19 13:30:11","","1228-1240","","","","","","","","","","","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: Assoc Comp Machinery; Quanta Comp; Taiwan Mobile Co Ltd; Chunghwa Telecom; Microsoft; Taipei City Govt, Dept Informat Technol; Zoom; FET; Web4Good; ELTA HD; ELTA Technol Co Ltd; Facebook; Yahoo Res; Pinterest Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>29th Web Conference (WWW), Taipei, TAIWAN, APR 20-24, 2020</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is particularly relevant in the case of customer relationships where a positive and affective interaction has an impact on the users' experience. In this paper, we address the question of whether a specific behavioral style of a barman-robot, acted through para-verbal and non-verbal behaviors, can affect users' engagement and the creation of positive emotions. To that end, we endowed a barman-robot taking drink orders from human customers, with an empathic behavioral style. This aims at triggering to alignment process by mimicking the conversation partner's behavior. This behavioral style is compared to an entertaining style, aiming at creating a positive relationship with the users, and a neutral style for control. Results suggest that when participants experienced more positive emotions, the robot was perceived as safer, so suggesting that interactions that stimulate positive and open relations with the robot may have a positive impact on the affective dimension of engagement. Indeed, when the empathic robot modulates its behavior according to the user's one, this interaction seems to be more effective than when interacting with a neutral robot in improving engagement and positive emotions in public-service contexts.","2020","2021-05-19 13:30:12","2021-05-19 13:30:12","","464-469","","","","","","","IEEE RO-MAN","","","","IEEE","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: IEEE; IEEE Robot & Automat Soc; Robot Soc Japan; Korean Robot Soc; Furhat Robot; EurAi; Assoc Italiana Lingusitica Computazionale; Assoc Italiana Scienze Voce; Springer; Robotics ISSN: 1944-9445 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>29th IEEE International Conference on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (IEEE RO-MAN), ELECTR NETWORK, AUG 31-SEP 04, 2020</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, privacy problems may occur owing to private information of the user being mentioned. We propose a novel dialogue strategy whereby a robot mentions another robot in the form of gossiping. This dialogue strategy can improve the sense of conversation, which results in increased interest while avoiding the privacy issue. We examined our proposal by conducting a conversation experiment evaluated by subject impressions. The results demonstrated that the proposed method could help the robot to obtain higher evaluations. In particular, the perceived mind was improved in the Likert scale evaluation, whereas the robot empathy and intention to use were improved in the binary comparison evaluation.

However, inappropriate communication of self-tracking results might cause the opposite effect. Subtle self-tracking feedback is an alternative that can be provided with the aid of an artificial agent representing the self. Hence, we propose a wearable pet that reflects the user's affective states through visual and haptic feedback. By eliciting empathy and fostering helping behaviors towards it, users would indirectly help themselves. A wearable prototype was built, and three user studies performed to evaluate the appropriateness of the proposed affective representations. Visual representations using facial and body cues were clear for valence and less clear for arousal. Haptic interoceptive patterns emulating heart-rate levels matched the desired feedback urgency levels with a saturation frequency. The integrated visuo-haptic representations matched to participants own affective experience. From the results, we derived three design guidelines for future robot mirroring wearable systems: physical embodiment, interoceptive feedback, and customization.","2020","2021-05-19 13:30:13","2021-05-19 13:30:13","","1328-1333","","","","","","","IEEE RO-MAN","","","","IEEE","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: IEEE; IEEE Robot & Automat Soc; Robot Soc Japan; Korean Robot Soc; Furhat Robot; EurAi; Assoc Italiana Lingusitica Computazionale; Assoc Italiana Scienze Voce; Springer; Robotics ISSN: 1944-9445 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>29th IEEE International Conference on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (IEEE RO-MAN), ELECTR NETWORK, AUG 31-SEP 04, 2020</p>","","","","embodiment; empathy and intersubjectivity; haptic feedback; human-machine interaction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The shift of journalism onto social networks has laid the foundations for a ludic communicative paradigm that revolves specifically around gaming mechanisms. Nevertheless, recent developments in artificial intelligence call for a partial redefinition of the term “gamification,” so as to situate it in its relations with machines and algorithms. For some time now, what are known as empathic media have signaled a turning point in the development of an emotional artificial intelligence, capable of eliciting and responding to the emotional states of consumers and users for commercial purposes. In recent years, this use of artificial emotional intelligence has also made its way into journalism on social networks. This communications channel builds on tools such as sensationalism, irony, and the creation of an empathetic connection with readers centered on sharing a ludic, humorous paradigm of communication. In this instance, gamification is transformed into AI-gamification, since the aim is to make these mechanisms scientific and commercially profitable through the use of artificial intelligence. Echobox, a social media platform based on artificial intelligence, used by media to communicate more efficiently with readers on social platforms, will provide a case study by which to analyze this effort. I will also show the benefits and drawbacks of this shift from gamification to AI-gamification, examining in particular the capacities and limits of the algorithms in developing a ludic human language whose goal is to increase both users' emotional involvement and the readership of the articles (and, consequently, the revenue) of the media outlets.","2020","2021-05-19 13:30:14","2021-05-19 13:30:14","","97-113","","","17","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: EDIFICIO STUDIUM 2000, VIA DI VALESIO, LECCE, 73100, ITALY Publisher: UNIV STUDI SALENTO Type: Article","","","","","Gamification; Artificial intelligence; Journalism; News; Social networks","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The behavior of tracking an adult's eye movements, which appears in typically developing children in about 6th month, is considered as the beginning point of the ability to respond to joint attention. Studies show that children with ASD exhibit less joint attention skill and they fail in looking at the direction others are looking at and pointing at and in following the direction others are looking at, pointing at when they are compared to typically developing children and other children with developmental retardation. It is reported in some studies that the behaviors of responding to others' joint attention and initiation to joint attention are taught separately, and in other studies, both joint attention abilities are taught together. Nowadays, robot applications have appeared as a new approach in ASD implementations as a result of technological and scientific developments. Various social robots have been produced with an aim to increase the motivation of those with ASD by decreasing the stress level in complicated situations in the social setting and by enabling them to learn in simpler, predictable, and controlled settings. Besides, recently, social robots have increasingly been used in teaching joint attention abilities. In this study, it was aimed to give information about joint attention and types of robots, explain the characteristics of social robots, and put forward the current trends related to social robots by examining the studies conducted on the use of social robots for teaching joint attention abilities to children with ASD. Social robots could be a promising method for ASD treatment. There are remarkably different results regarding the robot applications in teaching the joint attention abilities to children with ASD. Therefore, it is not definitively known to which extent robot therapy contributes to the student's joint attention improvement. While efficiency research is frequently conducted in the studies in which robots have been used for teaching joint attention abilities to children with ASD, although rarely, comparative studies have also been conducted in recent years. Positive results are mentioned in this efficiency research, whereas there are also controversial results. In comparative studies, it is noteworthy that the human being and robot applications were compared in only one study. As a result, robots are thought to provide a significant support for the development of joint attention interactions such as attracting the attention of children, helping them participate in activities, building a bond for social interaction, motivating them, providing natural stimuli and bringing about different emotional expressions although there are different results about robot applications in the development of the joint attention abilities of children with ASD. In the related literature, it is also suggested to work with larger and different sample groups in order to generalize the existing study results since it is observed that the dimension of generalization is not addressed. Further studies in which robots play an active role compared to therapists can be carried out.","2020","2021-05-19 13:30:16","2021-05-19 13:30:16","","2090-2097","","","","","","","INTED Proceedings","","","","IATED-INT ASSOC TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION & DEVELOPMENT","LAURI VOLPI 6, VALENICA, BURJASSOT 46100, SPAIN","English","","","","","","","ISSN: 2340-1079 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>14th International Technology, Education and Development Conference (INTED), Valencia, SPAIN, MAR 02-04, 2020</p>","","","","robots; social robot; joint attention; Autism spectrum disorder","Chova, LG and Martinez, AL and Torres, IC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, cognitive skills are not sufficient for a successful life. Understanding and managing the emotions of oneself is another crucial factor in success. The current state of the art teaching methods educates the kids about programming and emotional intelligence independently. In our opinion, it is advantageous to teach kids emotional intelligence, along with the programming concepts. However, the literature lacks the studies that make students emotionally aware while teaching them programming. This research aims to prepare students to be cognitively healthy as well as emotionally intelligent with the hypothesis that a kid's emotional intelligence can be enhanced while teaching them cognitive skills. We proposed a computational model that teaches programming and emotional intelligence side by side to students. The model provides a curriculum and related tools. For evaluations, five hundred students of a public school were involved in different activities to find the effectiveness of the proposed model. These students were divided into five groups (A, B, C, D, and E), each having a mean age of 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 years, respectively. Students performed multiple adaptive scenarios of path-finding that were based on self-awareness, social-awareness, sharing, and empathy emotions. Students provide the programming instructions such as sequencing, conditional statements, and looping to a robot. The children have successfully improved in both fundamental programming constructs and emotional intelligence skills. The research also successfully reduced screen time problem by providing a screen-free student interface.","2020","2021-05-19 13:30:16","2021-05-19 13:30:16","","149616-149629","","","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA Publisher: IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC Type: Article","","","","","Computational modeling; Education; Robots; Emotional intelligence; basic programming; Programming profession; robots based learning; screen-free interface; Sequential analysis; Tools","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The data collection in this study was carried out in a location, namely, Batang Regency, Indonesia, in May-June 2018. The qualitative data collection methods used in this study are in-depth interviews and document reviews. This study was using Service Quality (Servqual) questionnaire. The results show that PSC 119 Si Slamet provides easy access to emergency services to the community 24 hours a day and 7 days a week by simply calling 119 numbers, sending messages via SMS and WhatsApp, or using the Android-based application, with a maximum response time target of 10 minutes. Batang is one of the regencies (rural area) in Central Java province, located on the main coastline, with a hilly geographic condition with many derivatives, climbs, and sharp curves, which is one of the causes of the high number of traffic accidents in the area. This emergency care information systems, with Android-based application, was aimed at improving the quality of services in the health sector, especially emergency services. This service is of good quality as seen from the tangible, reliability, responsiveness, assurance, and empathy dimensions.

Part I briefly describes some of the ways AI is already in use in ordinary life - from facial recognition, through medical diagnosis to translation services. Part II describes how AI is transforming what it means to provide legal services in six primary areas: litigation review; expertise automation; legal research; contract analytics; contract and litigation document generation; and predictive analytics. Part III explores who are the providers of these AI driven legal services - often non-lawyer legal service providers - and how these providers are replacing at least some of what clients have traditionally sought from lawyers. Part III also discusses the implications of all these changes both for the future role of lawyers individually, and in particular what services will clients still need lawyers to perform: judgment, empathy, creativity and adaptability. In turn, this Part examines what will these changes mean for the size, shape, composition and economic model of law firms, as well as the implications of these changes for legal education and lawyer training. Part IV identifies the principal legal, ethical, regulatory and risk management issues raised by the use of AI in the provision of legal services. Finally, in Part V the article considers who will be the likely providers of AI based services other than law firms: legal publishers, major accounting firms and venture capital funded businesses.","2020","2021-05-19 13:30:17","2021-05-19 13:30:17","","","","1","16","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: RUA ROCHA, 23 11 ANDAR, SAO PAULO SP, 01330-0000, BRAZIL Publisher: FUNDACAO GETULIO VARGAS, ESCOLA DIREITO Type: Article","","","","","Artificial Intelligence (AI); Future of Legal Services; Lawyers; Legal Service Providers; Law Firms","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Mental health appears ripe for such disruption given the global illness burden, stigma, and shortage of care providers. Objective: To characterize the global psychiatrist community's opinion regarding the potential of future autonomous technology (referred to here as AI/ML) to replace key tasks carried out in mental health practice. Design: Cross sectional, random stratified sample of psychiatrists registered with Sermo, a global networking platform open to verified and licensed physicians. Main outcome measures: We measured opinions about the likelihood that AI/ML tools would be able to fully replace - not just assist - the average psychiatrist in performing 10 key psychiatric tasks. Among those who considered replacement likely, we measured opinions about how many years from now such a capacity might emerge. We also measured psychiatrist's perceptions about whether benefits of AI/ML would outweigh the risks. Results: Survey respondents were 791 psychiatrists from 22 countries representing North America, South America, Europe and Asia-Pacific. Only 3.8 % of respondents felt it was likely that future technology would make their jobs obsolete and only 17 % felt that future AI/ML was likely to replace a human clinician for providing empathetic care. Documenting and updating medical records (75 %) and synthesizing information (54 %) were the two tasks where a majority predicted that AI/ML could fully replace human psychiatrists. Female- and US-based doctors were more uncertain that the benefits of AI would outweigh risks than male- and non-US doctors, respectively. Around one in 2 psychiatrists did however predict that their jobs would be substantially changed by AI/ML. Conclusions: Our findings provide compelling insights into how physicians think about AI/ML which in turn may help us better integrate technology and reskill doctors to enhance mental health care.","2020-01","2021-05-19 13:30:17","2021-05-19 13:30:17","","","","","102","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS Publisher: ELSEVIER Type: Article","","","","","Deep learning; Empathy; Autonomous agents; Mental health","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In doing so, the paper proposes a new category of “melded” frontline employees (FLEs), where advanced technologies become embodied within human actors. The paper presents potential opportunities and challenges that may arise through cyborg technological advancements and proposes a future research agenda related to these. Design/methodology/approach This study draws on literature in the fields of services management, artificial intelligence, robotics, intelligence augmentation (IA) and human intelligence to conceptualise potential cyborgian applications. Findings The paper examines how cyborg bio- and psychophysical characteristics may significantly differentiate the nature of service interactions from traditional “unenhanced” service interactions. In doing so, the authors propose “melding” as a conceptual category of technological impact on FLEs. This category reflects the embodiment of emergent technologies not previously captured within existing literature on cyborgs. The authors examine how traditional roles of FLEs will be potentially impacted by the integration of emergent cyborg technologies, such as neural interfaces and implants, into service contexts before outlining future research directions related to these, specifically highlighting the range of ethical considerations. Originality/value Service interactions with cyborg FLEs represent a new context for examining the potential impact of cyborgs. This paper explores how technological advancements will alter the individual capacities of humans to enable such employees to intuitively and empathetically create solutions to complex service challenges. In doing so, the authors augment the extant literature on cyborgs, such as the body hacking movement. The paper also outlines a research agenda to address the potential consequences of cyborgian integration.","2019-12-02","2021-05-19 13:30:17","2021-05-19 13:30:17","","415-437","","4","29","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND Publisher: EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD Type: Article","","","","","Cyborgs; Emergent technologies; Frontline service employees; Service and service delivery","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This article presents a new framework, the 3S Process, as a method for teaching leaders how to strategically adopt AI within their organizations. At a high-level, the 3S Process consists of three stages (Story, Strategy, and Solution), which are described in detail in the article. Stage 1: Story in the process is inspired by the Harvard Case Method to provide context for a problem. Stage 2: Strategy uses Design Thinking to produce candidate solutions. The substage of Empathy in Design Thinking plays a crucial role to reduce bias in designing AI. Virtualization technology is a tool for students to experience hands-on learning in prototype development. Stage 3: Solution is where students advocate for their conceptual AI solution in the context of the case study. AI is a type of complex system; therefore, students should consider feedback loops and the potential for unintended biases to enter a deployed solution. The presentation of the 3S Process in this article is conceptual. Further empirical studies, including evaluations of the 3S Process in classroom settings, will be considered in the future.","2019-12","2021-05-19 13:30:18","2021-05-19 13:30:18","","36-42","","12","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: DUNTON TOWER RM 2122, 1125 COLONEL BY DR, OTTAWA, ON K1A 5B6, CANADA Publisher: CARLETON UNIV GRAPHIC SERVICES Type: Article","","","","","Artificial Intelligence; 3S Process; Business Education; Harvard Case Method; Design Thinking","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although this promises to deliver increased speed and accuracy, the future role of AI in relation to radiotherapy should be thought through carefully. There is currently a gap between published developments and widespread adoption, which provides some space to prepare the workforce and to consider the implications on practice. It is rare to find philosophical input into a medical journal, but the advent of AI makes this perspective increasingly important. Philosophical insight can help explore the potential impact of AI, in particular, on human creativity and oversight. Without this perspective, we run the risk of focusing solely on the immediate logistical impact on patients and departments. This commentary identifies three key aspects of radiotherapy that the authors feel would suffer most under AI control: creativity, innovation, and patient safety, which all demand uniquely human attributes. The article also provides insight from a philosophical perspective with regard to human consciousness, ethics, and empathy. Philosophically we should, perhaps, retain ethical concerns about the widening role of AI in radiotherapy beyond simple quantitative interpretation and image processing. As developments continue, we have time to determine how our roles will evolve and to establish a framework for ensuring appropriate human input into patient care. Most importantly, we must start to embed a philosophical approach to adoption of AI technology from the outset if we are to prepare ourselves for the challenge that lies ahead.","2019-12","2021-05-19 13:30:18","2021-05-19 13:30:18","","S27-S31","","4, 2","50","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA Publisher: ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC Type: Editorial Material","","","","","Artificial intelligence; philosophy; radiotherapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The two factors covered in Study 1 are utilitarian benefit based on egoistic motivation, and empathy based on altruistic motivation. In Study 2, utilitarian benefit is divided into explainable AI and monetary reward. The results indicate that two variables, namely empathy and monetary reward, have significant positive effects on willingness to help, and monetary reward is the strongest stimulus. In addition, explainable AI is shown to be positively associated with trust in AI. This study applies social studies of help motivation to the HCI field in order to induce users' willingness to help for an imperfect AI.

We draw on a particular line of posthumanist theory associated closely with the work of Karen Barad, Rosi Braidotti and N. Katherine Hayles that suggests a constantly permeable, fluid and extended subjectivity, displacing the boundaries between human and other. In doing so, we propose a posthuman concept of empathy in gameplay, and we apply this concept to data from the first author's 18-month ethnographic field notes of gameplay in the MMORPG World of Warcraft. Exploring these data through our analysis of posthuman empathy, we demonstrate the entanglement of avatar-player, machine-human relationship. We show how empathy allows us to understand this relationship as constantly negotiated and in process, producing visceral reactions in the intra-connected avatar-player subject as well as moments of co-produced in-game action that require `affective matching' between subjective and embodied experiences. We argue that this account of the avatar-player relationship extends research in game culture, providing a horizontal, non-hierarchical discussion of its most necessary interaction.","2019-12","2021-05-19 13:30:18","2021-05-19 13:30:18","","791-806","","5-6","25","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 2455 ℡LER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA Publisher: SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC Type: Article","","","","","empathy; posthuman; embodiment; Avatar-player relationships; digital culture; MMORPG; posthuman empathy; posthuman subjectivity; World of Warcraft","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study exploits field experiment data on more than 6,200 customers who are randomized to receive highly structured outbound sales calls from chatbots or human workers. Results suggest that undisclosed chatbots are as effective as proficient workers and four times more effective than inexperienced workers in engendering customer purchases. However, a disclosure of chatbot identity before the machine-customer conversation reduces purchase rates by more than 79.7%. Additional analyses find that these results are robust to nonresponse bias and hang-ups, and the chatbot disclosure substantially decreases call length. Exploration of the mechanisms reveals that when customers know the conversational partner is not a human, they are curt and purchase less because they perceive the disclosed bot as less knowledgeable and less empathetic. The negative disclosure effect seems to be driven by a subjective human perception against machines, despite the objective competence of AI chatbots. Fortunately, such negative impact can be mitigated by a late disclosure timing strategy and customer prior AI experience. These findings offer useful implications for chatbot applications, customer targeting, and advertising in conversational commerce.","2019-12","2021-05-19 13:30:18","2021-05-19 13:30:18","","937-947","","6","38","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 5521 RESEARCH PARK DR, SUITE 200, CATONSVILLE, MD 21228 USA Publisher: INFORMS Type: Article","","","","","artificial intelligence; chatbot; conversational commerce; disclosure; new technology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A real-time 3D image of their lower limbs was modelized and projected on the screen ahead of them, as if in a walking motion from left to right. The subjects were instructed to continue walking. When we initiated an increase in the knee flexion of the avatar, we observed a similar increase in the subjects' knee flexion. No significant results were observed when the modification involved a decrease in knee flexion. The results and their significance are discussed using theories encompassing empathy, sympathy and sensory re-calibration. The prospect of using this type of modified avatar for stroke rehabilitation is discussed.","2019-11","2021-05-19 13:30:19","2021-05-19 13:30:19","","","","11","5","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND Publisher: ELSEVIER SCI LTD Type: Article","","","","","Rehabilitation; Empathy; Neuroscience; Sympathy; Avatar; Adaptation; Biomedical engineering; Knee flexion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the traditional use of didactic lectures for communication skills training is ineffective, and the use of standardized patients is not time- or cost-effective. Given the abilities of virtual patients (VPs) to simulate interactive and authentic clinical scenarios in secured environments with unlimited training attempts, a virtual counseling application is an ideal platform for nursing students to hone their communication skills before their clinical postings. Objective: The aim of this study was to develop and test the use of VPs to better prepare nursing undergraduates for communicating with real-life patients, their family members, and other health care professionals during their clinical postings. Methods: The stages of the creation of VPs included preparation, design, and development, followed by a testing phase before the official implementation. An initial voice chatbot was trained using a natural language processing engine, Google Cloud's Dialogflow, and was later visualized into a three-dimensional (3D) avatar form using Unity 3D. Results: The VPs included four case scenarios that were congruent with the nursing undergraduates' semesters' learning objectives: (1) assessing the pain experienced by a pregnant woman, (2) taking the history of a depressed patient, (3) escalating a bleeding episode of a postoperative patient to a physician, and (4) showing empathy to a stressed-out fellow final-year nursing student. Challenges arose in terms of content development, technological limitations, and expectations management, which can be resolved by contingency planning, open communication, constant program updates, refinement, and training. Conclusions: The creation of VPs to assist in nursing students' communication skills training may provide authentic learning environments that enhance students' perceived self-efficacy and confidence in effective communication skills. However, given the infancy stage of this project, further refinement and constant enhancements are needed to train the VPs to simulate real-life conversations before the official implementation.","2019-10-29","2021-05-19 13:30:19","2021-05-19 13:30:19","","","","10","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 130 QUEENS QUAY E, STE 1102, TORONTO, ON M5A 0P6, CANADA Publisher: JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC Type: Article","","","","","artificial intelligence; learning; communication; virtual reality; technology; nursing education; patients","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A useful thought experiment is the application of the Turing test to user-facing artificial intelligence systems in health care. In this paper I argue that many medical decisions require value judgements and the doctor-patient relationship requires empathy and understanding to arrive at a shared decision, often handling large areas of uncertainty and balancing competing risks. Arguably, medicine requires wisdom more than intelligence, artificial or otherwise. Artificial intelligence therefore needs to supplement rather than replace medical professionals, and identifying the complementary positioning of artificial intelligence in medical consultation is a key challenge for the future. In health care, artificial intelligence needs to pass the implementation game, not the imitation game.","2019-10-28","2021-05-19 13:30:19","2021-05-19 13:30:19","","","","10","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 130 QUEENS QUAY E, STE 1102, TORONTO, ON M5A 0P6, CANADA Publisher: JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC Type: Article","","","","","artificial intelligence; machine learning; conversational agents; chatbots; medical informatics; ehealth; digital health","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study examines perceived mistreatment directed towards a robot in comparison to a computer. This will provide some understanding of how people feel about robots in collaborative social settings. We conducted a two by two between-subjects study with 80 participants. Participants worked cooperatively with either a robot or a computer agent. An experiment confederate would either act aggressively or neutrally towards the agent. We hypothesized that people would not perceive aggressive speech as mistreatment when an agent was capable of emotional feelings and similar to themselves; that participants would perceive the robot as more similar in appearance and emotionally capable to themselves than a computer; and so would observe more mistreatment with a robot. The final results supported our hypotheses; the participants observed greater mistreatment for the robot, but not the computer. Also participants felt significantly more sympathetic towards the robot and believed that it was much more emotionally capable.","2019-12","2021-05-19 13:30:19","2021-05-19 13:30:19","","727-739","","5","11","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article","","","","","Perception; Human-robot interaction; Human-robot cooperation; Mistreatment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A fundamental requirement in all social interactions is the ability to engage, maintain, and demonstrate attention. Attentional behaviors include leaning forward, self-disclosure, and changes in voice pitch. Objective: This study aimed to examine the effect of robot attentional behaviors on user perceptions and behaviors in a simulated health care interaction. Methods: A parallel randomized controlled trial with a 1:1:1 allocation ration was conducted. We randomized participants to 1 of 4 experimental conditions before engaging in a scripted face-to-face interaction with a fully automated medical receptionist robot. Experimental conditions included a self-disclosure condition, voice pitch change condition, forward lean condition, and neutral condition. Participants completed paper-based postinteraction measures relating to engagement, perceived robot attention, and perceived robot empathy. We video recorded interactions and coded for participant attentional behaviors. Results: A total of 181 participants were recruited from the University of Auckland. Participants who interacted with the robot in the forward lean and self-disclosure conditions found the robot to be significantly more stimulating than those who interacted with the robot in the voice pitch or neutral conditions (P=.03). Participants in the forward lean, self-disclosure, and neutral conditions found the robot to be significantly more interesting than those in the voice pitch condition (P<.001). Participants in the forward lean and self-disclosure conditions spent significantly more time looking at the robot than participants in the neutral condition (P<.001). Significantly, more participants in the self-disclosure condition laughed during the interaction (P=.01), whereas significantly more participants in the forward lean condition leant toward the robot during the interaction (P<.001). Conclusions: The use of self-disclosure and forward lean by a health care robot can increase human engagement and attentional behaviors. Voice pitch changes did not increase attention or engagement. The small effects with regard to participant perceptions are potentially because of the limitations in self-report measures or a lack of comparison for most participants who had never interacted with a robot before. Further research could explore the use of self-disclosure and forward lean using a within-subjects design and in real health care settings.","2019-10-04","2021-05-19 13:30:20","2021-05-19 13:30:20","","","","10","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 130 QUEENS QUAY E, STE 1102, TORONTO, ON M5A 0P6, CANADA Publisher: JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC Type: Article","","","","","engagement; social interaction; robotics; health care robotics; social intelligence","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Curtis","An Essay on Narrative, Reality, and Imagination","PSYCHOANALYTIC INQUIRY","","0735-1690","10.1080/07351690.2019.1659025","","Narrative is a verbal account, a story of related events which can be factual, fictional or both. Life experience and imagination are as essential to narrative as narrative is to mankind. The phylogenic perspective of literature suggests an inborn capacity for empathy, intelligence and inventiveness, whereas the ontological example is variable. Western knowledge, politics and ethics have evolved from their narrative of Greek myth, epic and drama, the few medieval writers, singularly by the Elizabethan theater, importantly the Arthurian legend and romance stories, English and Russian novels, and uniquely the American short story. This heritage progressively demarcated such life themes as the hero, maiden and adversary; love, hate and indifference; loyalty, deception and betrayal; desire, achievement and loss. These characterizations of self and other remain relevant to the contemporary novel, cinema/TV, and theater, as well as the news, commentary, and real life. Conversely, postmodern assumptions challenge that individual subjectivity determines what is real, valid or authentic, consequently the relativism of traditional, institutional and historical precedents of the truth. Further, the computer, gaming, smart device, and artificial intelligence have changed the content and function of customary narrative. Nonetheless, narrative ? real and imagined, ancient and new ? retains the meaning of a story about connected events which variously transcends the boundaries of difference.","2019-10-03","2021-05-19 13:30:20","2021-05-19 13:30:20","","476-484","","7, SI","39","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND Publisher: ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Facing challenges wrought by science and technology as well as societal change, the curriculum is increasingly out of synch with new needs in teaching content and medical practice. The path to significant curricular reform is difficult because of a variety of factors, including deeply entrenched values, the natural resistance to change, and the accreditation process. Indeed, even the very definition of what it means to be a professional is changing with profound implications for the future role of the physician and the sacrosanct doctor-patient relationship. In this Invited Commentary, the author enumerates challenges facing medical education in the current era. To address these challenges, the author recommends specific curricular emphases for 21st-century medical education: knowledge capture and curation, collaboration with and management of artificial intelligence applications, a deep understanding of probabilistic reasoning, and the cultivation of empathy and compassion in accordance with ethical standards. Given these needs, it is imperative that schools act today to undertake significant curricular reform and, in so doing, strive to make the hard changes necessary to produce optimal practitioners in a rapidly transforming 21st century. The author provides first steps an institution can take to begin to address these challenges.","2019-10","2021-05-19 13:30:20","2021-05-19 13:30:20","","1412-1415","","10","94","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA Publisher: LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS Type: Editorial Material","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Given that congruence in perceived representations of the world enable humans to experience commonality in mental states (a shared reality), we propose that congruence between humans, and robots will encourage humans to attribute humanlike mental capacities to robots. To investigate this, we assessed the mental perceptions of a robot in a visual imagination task using Gray et al. mind perception scale, which evaluates experience (capacity to feel), and agency (capacity to plan and do). For each ambiguous picture in the designed task, humans, and a robot imagined an animal. The task was performed under six conditions (2 x 3: Lead/Follow for Low/Medium/High). In the Lead condition, the robot records its perceived animal first; in the Follow condition, the robot records after the human participant. The experiment had three different degrees of congruence: Low (0%), Medium (60%), and High (100%). The results showed that perceived experiences were higher in the Lead condition, suggesting that the robot is perceived to be empathetic. It is probable that the Follow condition was perceived as mimicry rather than shared reality. Therefore, the order of response may have played an important role in commonality in mental states. No differences were observed in the perceived agency across all conditions. These results suggest that the order of response affects how humans perceive the minds of robots. Additionally, we assessed a post-task questionnaire to evaluate the interpersonal closeness that the humans felt toward the android. The main effect was observed in the degrees of congruence. This result is in line with those of previous studies that report relationships across sharing of similarities and friendliness.","2019-09-18","2021-05-19 13:30:20","2021-05-19 13:30:20","","","","","6","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND Publisher: FRONTIERS MEDIA SA Type: Article","","","","","mind perception; robot; interpersonal closeness; shared reality; visual imagination","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By collaborating among several robots, the robots provide information while maintaining the naturalness of conversation. However, the effectiveness of interaction with people has not been surveyed using this method.

In this article, this hypothesis is argued from several viewpoints towards its verification. A developmental process of empathy, morality, and ethics based on the mirror neuron system (MNS) that promotes the emergence of the concept of self (and others) scaffolds the emergence of artificial minds. Firstly, an outline of the ideological background on issues of the mind in a broad sense is shown, followed by the limitation of the current progress of artificial intelligence (AI), focusing on deep learning. Next, artificial pain is introduced, along with its architectures in the early stage of self-inflicted experiences of pain, and later, in the sharing stage of the pain between self and others. Then, cognitive developmental robotics (CDR) is revisited for two important concepts-physical embodiment and social interaction, both of which help to shape conscious minds. Following the working hypothesis, existing studies of CDR are briefly introduced and missing issues are indicated. Finally, the issue of how robots (artificial systems) could be moral agents is addressed.","2019-09","2021-05-19 13:30:21","2021-05-19 13:30:21","","","","3","4","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND Publisher: MDPI Type: Article","","","","","pain; empathy; mirror neuron system (MNS); morality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, only few studies have investigated how functional network changes are related to social anhedonia. The aim of this fMRI study was to classify subjects according to their degree of social anhedonia using supervised machine learning. More specifically, we extracted both spatial and temporal network features during a social cognition task from 70 subjects, and used support vector machines for classification. Since impairment in social cognition is well established in schizophrenia-spectrum disorders, the subjects performed a comic strip task designed to specifically probe theory of mind (ToM) and empathy processing. Features representing both temporal (time series) and network dynamics were extracted using task activation maps, seed region analysis, independent component analysis (ICA), and a newly developed multi-subject archetypal analysis (MSAA), which here aimed to further bridge aspects of both seed region analysis and decomposition by incorporating a spotlight approach.We found significant classification of subjects with elevated levels of social anhedonia when using the times series extracted using MSAA, indicating that temporal dynamics carry important information for classification of social anhedonia. Interestingly, we found that the same time series yielded the highest classification performance in a task classification of the ToM condition. Finally, the spatial network corresponding to that time series included both prefrontal and temporal-parietal regions as well as insula activity, which previously have been related schizotypy and the development of schizophrenia.","2019-12-01","2021-05-19 13:30:21","2021-05-19 13:30:21","","4965-4981","","17","40","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA Publisher: WILEY Type: Article","","","","","archetypical analysis; decomposition; functional connectivity; social anhedonia; support vector classification","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Their acceptance in social and emotional human-robot interaction (HRI) scenarios depends on their ability to convey well recognized and believable emotional expressions to their human users. In this article, we incorporate recent findings from psychology, neuroscience, human-computer interaction, and HRI, to examine how people recognize and respond to emotions displayed by the body and voice of humanoid robots, with a particular emphasis on the effects of incongruence. In a social HRI laboratory experiment, we investigated contextual incongruence (i.e., the conflict situation where a robot's reaction is incongrous with the socio-emotional context of the interaction) and cross-modal incongruence (i.e., the conflict situation where an observer receives incongruous emotional information across the auditory (vocal prosody) and visual (whole-body expressions) modalities). Results showed that both contextual incongruence and cross-modal incongruence confused observers and decreased the likelihood that they accurately recognized the emotional expressions of the robot. This, in turn, gives the impression that the robot is unintelligent or unable to express “empathic” behaviour and leads to profoundly harmful effects on likability and believability. Our findings reinforce the need of proper design of emotional expressions for robots that use several channels to communicate their emotional states in a clear and effective way. We offer recommendations regarding design choices and discuss future research areas in the direction of multimodal HRI.","2019-08","2021-05-19 13:30:21","2021-05-19 13:30:21","","555-573","","4","11","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article","","","","","Human-robot interaction; Social robots; Robot emotions; Body language; Believability; Multi-modal interaction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, AI-based chatbot systems can act as automated conversational agents, capable of promoting health, providing education, and potentially prompting behaviour change. Exploring the motivation to use health chatbots is required to predict uptake; however, few studies to date have explored their acceptability. This research aimed to explore participants' willingness to engage with AI-led health chatbots. Methods The study incorporated semi-structured interviews (N-29) which informed the development of an online survey (N-216) advertised via social media. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically. A survey of 24 items explored demographic and attitudinal variables, including acceptability and perceived utility. The quantitative data were analysed using binary regressions with a single categorical predictor. Results Three broad themes: `Understanding of chatbots', `AI hesitancy' and `Motivations for health chatbots' were identified, outlining concerns about accuracy, cyber-security, and the inability of AI-led services to empathise. The survey showed moderate acceptability (67%), correlated negatively with perceived poorer IT skills OR = 0.32 [CI95%:0.13-0.78] and dislike for talking to computers OR = 0.77 [CI95%:0.60-0.99] as well as positively correlated with perceived utility OR = 5.10 [CI95%:3.08-8.43], positive attitude OR = 2.71 [CI95%:1.77-4.16] and perceived trustworthiness OR = 1.92 [CI95%:1.13-3.25]. Conclusion Most internet users would be receptive to using health chatbots, although hesitancy regarding this technology is likely to compromise engagement. Intervention designers focusing on AI-led health chatbots need to employ user-centred and theory-based approaches addressing patients' concerns and optimising user experience in order to achieve the best uptake and utilisation. Patients' perspectives, motivation and capabilities need to be taken into account when developing and assessing the effectiveness of health chatbots.","2019-08","2021-05-19 13:30:22","2021-05-19 13:30:22","","","","","5","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND Publisher: SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD Type: Article","","","","","AI; Artificial Intelligence; chatbot; bot; Acceptability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Altruists and controls completed fMRI testing while anticipating and experiencing pain, and watching as a stranger anticipated and experienced pain. Machine learning classifiers tested for shared representation between experienced and observed distress. Altruists exhibited more similar representations of experienced and observed fearful anticipation spontaneously and following an empathy prompt in anterior insula and anterior/middle cingulate cortex, respectively, suggesting heightened empathic proclivities and abilities for fear. During pain epochs, altruists were distinguished by spontaneous empathic responses in anterior insula, anterior/mid-cingulate cortex and supplementary motor area, but showed no difference from controls after the empathy prompt. These findings (1) link shared multi-voxel representations of the distress of self and others to real-world costly altruism, (2) reinforce distinctions between empathy for sensory states like pain and anticipatory affective states like fear, and (3) highlight the importance of differentiating between the proclivity and ability to empathize.","2019-07-24","2021-05-19 13:30:22","2021-05-19 13:30:22","","","","","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND Publisher: NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we use a simple neuroscience-inspired procedure to beam our human subjects into one of two distinct robots and demonstrate how this can readily increase acceptability and social closeness to that robot. Participants wore a Head Mounted Display tracking their head movements and displaying the 3D visual scene taken from the eyes of a robot which was positioned in front of a mirror and piloted by the subjects' head movements. As a result, participants saw themselves as a robot. When participant' and robot's head movements were correlated, participants felt that they were incorporated into the robot with a sense of agency. Critically, the robot they embodied was judged more likeable and socially closer. Remarkably, we found that the beaming experience with correlated head movements and corresponding sensation of embodiment and social proximity, was independent of robots' humanoid's appearance. These findings not only reveal the ease of body-swapping, via visual-motor synchrony, into robots that do not share any clear human resemblance, but they may also pave a new way to make our future robotic helpers socially acceptable.","2019-07-12","2021-05-19 13:30:22","2021-05-19 13:30:22","","","","","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND Publisher: NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

More importantly, these devices can be a life-saving help for people with a higher risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP), especially in case of generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS). The Embrace and E4 wristbands (Empatica) are the first commercially available multimodal wristbands that were designed to sense the physiological hallmarks of ongoing GTCS: while Embrace only embeds a machine learning-based detection algorithm, both E4 and Embrace devices are equipped with motion (accelerometers, ACC) and electrodermal activity (EDA) sensors and both the devices received medical clearance (E4 from EU CE, Embrace from EU CE and US FDA). The aim of this contribution is to provide updated evidence of the effectiveness of GTCS detection and monitoring relying on the combination of ACM and EDA sensors. A machine learning algorithm able to recognize ACC and EDA signatures of GTCS-like events has been developed on E4 data, labeled using gold-standard video-EEG examined by epileptologists in clinical centers, and has undergone continuous improvement. While keeping an elevated sensitivity to GTCS (92-100%), algorithm improvements and growing data availability led to lower false alarm rate (FAR) from the initial (similar to)2 down to 0.2-1 false alarms per day, as showed by retrospective and prospective analyses in inpatient settings. Algorithm adjustment to better discriminate real-life physical activities from GTCS, has brought the initial FAR of (similar to)6 on outpatient real life settings, down to values comparable to best-case clinical settings (FAR < 0.5), with comparable sensitivity. Moreover, using multimodal sensing, it has been possible not only to detect GTCS but also to quantify seizure-induced autonomic dysfunction, based on automatic features of abnormal motion and EDA. The latter biosignal correlates with the duration of post-ictal generalized EEG suppression, a biomarker observed in 100% of monitored SUDEP cases.","2019-07","2021-05-19 13:30:23","2021-05-19 13:30:23","","79-82","","","153","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS Publisher: ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV Type: Article","","","","","Machine learning; Epilepsy; Electrodermal activity; Convulsive seizures; SUDEP; Wearable device","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

BACKGROUND: Meaningful recognition positively impacts nursing and organizational outcomes. The use of AI techniques such as natural language processing andmachine learning to identify and describe behaviors impacting patient experiences is an emerging science. METHODS: Nurse recognition comments were collected from a convenience sample of 3 organizations via an IPC inpatient platform and analyzed using the AI techniques of natural language processing, machine learning, sentiment analytics, and corollary dictionaries based on rules of linguistics. RESULTS: The top theme of nursing recognition comments was courtesy and respect with the behaviors of empathy/compassion, helpfulness, kindness, attentiveness, and emotional comfort. The theme of skills/knowledge was the 2nd most common, with the behaviors of being professional, knowledgeable, keeping track, competence, dedication, and being thorough. CONCLUSIONS: AI techniques for qualitative analysis of comments collected through IPC reveal nurse themes and behaviors most meaningful to patients and their family members. Nurses can advance the science of AI and guide its evolution so that nurse caring behaviors associated with establishing human connections that positively influence patient and family experience are accurately represented.","2019-06","2021-05-19 13:30:23","2021-05-19 13:30:23","","303-309","","6","49","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA Publisher: LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Machine learning and speech signal processing technologies provide a way to scale up feedback in psychotherapy. We evaluated an initial proof of concept automated feedback system that generates motivational interviewing quality metrics and provides easy access to other session data (e.g.. transcripts). The system automatically provides a report of session-level metrics (e.g., therapist empathy) and therapist behavior codes at the talk-turn level (e.g., reflections).

A sample of 21 novice (n = 10) or experienced (n = 11) therapists each completed a 10-min session with a standardized patient. The system received the audio from the session as input and then automatically generated feedback that therapists accessed via a web portal. All participants found the system easy to use and were satisfied with their feedback, 83% found the feedback consistent with their own perceptions of their clinical performance, and 90% reported they were likely to use the feedback in their practice.

Papert did not simply invent some technology, he offered a revolutionary way of educating children. He gave teachers practical tools to realise constructionist developmental theories in the classroom. We will show that Papert's work forms a Kuhnian Paradigm which has endured for nearly 50 years and provides the foundation for all work with educational robots. The use of educational robots in special needs education was one of many benefits that grew out of the resulting environment. The early robots designs didn't pay attention the needs of this area of education. So early researchers used the available robots and started to ask and seek answers to relevant questions. We analyse this historical research and report on their findings. We find modern research simply confirms the original work. We will introduce the Papert Paradigm and show how it empathised with the changing attitudes towards special needs education.

As guided iCBT is considered more effective than unguided iCBT, such automated feedback may help close the gap between the two. The accuracy of automated sentiment analysis is domain dependent, and ft is unclear how well the technology is applicable to iCBT. This paper presents an empirical study in which automated sentiment analysis by an algorithm for the Dutch language is validated against human judgment. Methods: A total of 493 iCBT user texts were evaluated on overall sentiment and the presence of five specific emotions by an algorithm, and by 52 psychology students who evaluated 75 randomly selected texts each, providing about eight human evaluations per text. Inter-rater agreement (IRR) between algorithm and humans, and humans among each other, was analyzed by calculating the intra-class correlation under a numerical interpretation of the data, and Cohen's kappa, and Krippendorff's alpha under a categorical interpretation. Results: All analyses indicated moderate agreement between the algorithm and average human judgment with respect to evaluating overall sentiment, and low agreement for the specific emotions. Somewhat surprisingly, the same was the case for the IRR among human judges, which means that the algorithm performed about as well as a randomly selected human judge. Thus, considering average human judgment as a benchmark for the applicability of automated sentiment analysis, the technique can be considered for practical application. Discussion/Conclusion: The low human-human agreement on the presence of emotions may be due to the nature of the texts, it may simply be difficult for humans to agree on the presence of the selected emotions, or perhaps trained therapists would have reached more consensus. Future research may focus on validating the algorithm against a more solid benchmark, on applying the algorithm in an application in which empathic feedback is provided, for example, by an embodied conversational agent, or on improving the algorithm for the iCBT domain with a bottom-up machine learning approach.","2019-05-14","2021-05-19 13:30:24","2021-05-19 13:30:24","","","","","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND Publisher: FRONTIERS MEDIA SA Type: Article","","","","","depression; automated support; benchmarking and validation; cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT); e-mental health; embodied conversational agent (ECA); internet interventions; sentiment analysis and opinion mining","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Poor sleep quality and fatigue, as prominent characteristics of fibromyalgia, have a direct impact on patient behavior and quality of life. As such, the detection of extreme cases of sleep quality and fatigue level is a prerequisite for any intervention that can improve sleep quality and reduce fatigue level for people with fibromyalgia and enhance their daytime functionality. In this study, we propose a new supervised machine learning method called Learning Using Concave and Convex Kernels (LUCCK). This method employs similarity functions whose convexity or concavity can be configured so as to determine a model for each feature separately, and then uses this information to reweight the importance of each feature proportionally during classification. The data used for this study was collected from patients with fibromyalgia and consisted of blood volume pulse (BVP), 3-axis accelerometer, temperature, and electrodermal activity (EDA), recorded by an Empatica E4 wristband over the courses of several days, as well as a self-reported survey.

This paper proposes a novel approach to enable robotic path planning. The proposed approach combines robot reasoning with knowledge reasoning techniques, hedge algebra, and the Spiral Spanning Tree Coverage (STC) algorithm, for a cleaning and monitoring robot with optimal decisions. This approach is used to apply knowledge inference and hedge algebra with the Spiral STC algorithm to enable autonomous robot control in the optimal coverage path planning, with minimum obstacle avoidance. The results of experiments show that the proposed approach in the optimal robot path planning avoids tangible and intangible obstacles for the monitoring and cleaning robot. Experimental results are compared with current methods under the same conditions. The proposed model using knowledge reasoning techniques in the optimal coverage path performs better than the conventional algorithms in terms of high robot coverage and low repetition rates.

Internal motivational factors for studying medicine (e.g., care for patients, save lives) coupled with a deep approach to learning have been positively related to empathy in contrast to external motivational factors (e.g., future earning potential, prestige) and surface learning. However, assessments of these assumptions among medical school candidates are scarce. This study examined the relationship between different motivational factors and empathy among students enrolled in a selection year in medicineby testing the mediating role of learning approaches. A sample of 572 candidates for medical studies answered a self-reported questionnaire half way through their selection year. Measures included internal and external motivational factors for studying medicine, deep and surface learning approaches and empathy. Path-analysis tested the mediation effects of deep and surface approaches to learning on the relationship of internal and external motivational factors with empathy. The deep learning approach partially mediated the significant positive association between internal motivational factors and empathy, while the surface learning approach fully mediated the significant negative association between external motivational factors and empathy. These results suggest that learning approaches could be a pathway by which internal and external motives for studying medicine are related to empathy among medical school candidates. Pedagogical strategies and educational environments accounting for individual differences in motivation and learning may contribute to training students to become professional and caring doctors in the future.","2019-05","2021-05-19 13:30:25","2021-05-19 13:30:25","","287-300","","2","24","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article","","","","","Empathy; Learning approaches; Motivational factors; Undergraduate medical students","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the present study, we combined functional neuroimaging with a robot socializing intervention to probe the flexibility of empathy, a core component of social relationships, towards robots. Twenty-six individuals underwent identical fMRI sessions before and after being issued a social robot to take home and interact with over the course of a week. While undergoing fMRI, participants observed videos of a human actor or a robot experiencing pain or pleasure in response to electrical stimulation. Repetition suppression of activity in the pain network, a collection of brain regions associated with empathy and emotional responding, was measured to test whether socializing with a social robot leads to greater overlap in neural mechanisms when observing human and robotic agents experiencing pain or pleasure. In contrast to our hypothesis, functional region-of-interest analyses revealed no change in neural overlap for agents after the socializing intervention. Similarly, no increase in activation when observing a robot experiencing pain emerged post-socializing. Whole-brain analysis showed that, before the socializing intervention, superior parietal and early visual regions are sensitive to novel agents, while after socializing, medial temporal regions show agent sensitivity. A region of the inferior parietal lobule was sensitive to novel emotions, but only during the pre-socializing scan session. Together, these findings suggest that a short socialization intervention with a social robot does not lead to discernible differences in empathy towards the robot, as measured by behavioural or brain responses. We discuss the extent to which long-term socialization with robots might shape social cognitive processes and ultimately our relationships with these machines.

While this can be very effective, vibration as a physical stimulation is limited in modality and is uncommon in the natural world. In many cases, for human-robot and human-human interaction, a more natural, affective tactile interaction is needed to provide comfortable and varied stimuli. In this letter, we present the super-cutaneous wearable electrical empathic stimulator (SCWEES), a tactile device that gently stretches and squeezes the surface of the skin. Our hypothesis is that this device can create a pleasant, unobtrusive sensation that can be used to mediate social interactions or to deliver subtle alerts. We describe the design of the SCWEES, a lightweight 3D-printed semi-flexible structure that attaches to the skin at two points and actuates via two shape-memory alloy coil actuators. We evaluate the SCWEES through a range of human interaction experiments: stimulation strength and pleasantness, contraction and extension, and the conveyance of non-disruptive notifications. Quantitative and qualitative results show that the SCWEES generates a pleasant sensation, can convey useful information in human-machine interactions, and delivers affective stimulation that is less disruptive than conventional vibratory tactile stimulation when the user is engaged in a task.","2019-04","2021-05-19 13:30:26","2021-05-19 13:30:26","","1641-1646","","2","4","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA Publisher: IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC Type: Article","","","","","affective tactile stimulation; haptics and haptic interfaces; social human-robot interaction; soft robot applications; Wearable robots","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the present study, we investigated the relationship between mimicry and cognitive and emotional empathy. To assess mimicry, facial electromyography was recorded for 70 participants while they completed the Multifaceted Empathy Test, which presents complex context-embedded emotional expressions. As predicted, inter-individual differences in emotional and cognitive empathy were associated with the level of facial mimicry. For positive emotions, the intensity of the mimicry response scaled with the level of state emotional empathy. Mimicry was stronger for the emotional empathy task compared to the cognitive empathy task. The specific empathy condition could be successfully detected from facial muscle activity at the level of single individuals using machine learning techniques. These results support the view that mimicry occurs depending on the social context as a tool to affiliate and it is involved in cognitive as well as emotional empathy.","2019-11-17","2021-05-19 13:30:26","2021-05-19 13:30:26","","1672-1686","","8","33","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND Publisher: ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD Type: Article","","","","","empathy; cognitive; complex emotions; emotional; Facial mimicry","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Objective: This study aimed to explore general practitioners' (GPs') opinions about the potential impact of future technology on key tasks in primary care. Methods: In June 2018, we conducted a Web-based survey of 720 UK GPs' opinions about the likelihood of future technology to fully replace GPs in performing 6 key primary care tasks, and, if respondents considered replacement for a particular task likely, to estimate how soon the technological capacity might emerge. This study involved qualitative descriptive analysis of written responses (”comments”) to an open-ended question in the survey. Results: Comments were classified into 3 major categories in relation to primary care: (1) limitations of future technology, (2) potential benefits of future technology, and (3) social and ethical concerns. Perceived limitations included the beliefs that communication and empathy are exclusively human competencies; many GPs also considered clinical reasoning and the ability to provide value-based care as necessitating physicians' judgments. Perceived benefits of technology included expectations about improved efficiencies, in particular with respect to the reduction of administrative burdens on physicians. Social and ethical concerns encompassed multiple, divergent themes including the need to train more doctors to overcome workforce shortfalls and misgivings about the acceptability of future technology to patients. However, some GPs believed that the failure to adopt technological innovations could incur harms to both patients and physicians. Conclusions: This study presents timely information on physicians' views about the scope of artificial intelligence (AI) in primary care. Overwhelmingly, GPs considered the potential of AI to be limited. These views differ from the predictions of biomedical informaticians. More extensive, stand-alone qualitative work would provide a more in-depth understanding of GPs' views.","2019-03-20","2021-05-19 13:30:26","2021-05-19 13:30:26","","","","3","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 59 WINNERS CIRCLE, TORONTO, ON M4L 3Y7, CANADA Publisher: JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC Type: Article","","","","","artificial intelligence; machine learning; attitudes; future; opinions; qualitative research; technology; general practice; primary care","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We address two research questions: (1) Can an autonomous robot designed with empathic competencies foster collaborative learning in a group context? (2) Can an empathic robot sustain positive educational outcomes in long-term collaborative learning interactions with groups of students? To answer these questions, we developed an autonomous robot with empathic competencies that is able to interact with a group of students in a learning activity about sustainable development. Two studies were conducted. The first study compares learning outcomes in children across three conditions: learning with an empathic robot; learning with a robot without empathic capabilities; and learning without a robot. The results show that the autonomous robot with empathy fosters meaningful discussions about sustainability, which is a learning outcome in sustainability education. The second study features groups of students who interact with the robot in a school classroom for 2 months. The long-term educational interaction did not seem to provide significant learning gains, although there was a change in game-actions to achieve more sustainability during game-play. This result reflects the need to perform more long-term research in the field of educational robots for group learning.","2019-03","2021-05-19 13:30:26","2021-05-19 13:30:26","","","","1","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 2 PENN PLAZA, STE 701, NEW YORK, NY 10121-0701 USA Publisher: ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY Type: Article","","","","","education; empathy; human-robot interaction; collaborative learning; group learning; learning gains; Social robotics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The present research aimed to investigate the impact of occupational stereotypes, evoked by attire, as well as posture on person perception. For this, computer animation was used to create avatars with different types of attire (nurse, military, casual) and posture (open, closed). In Study 1 (N=164), participants attributed significantly more empathy to avatars wearing a nurse versus a military uniform or casual outfit. When adding posture as an additional cue, Study 2 (N=312) showed that ratings of empathy and dominance were affected by both attire and posture. This effect was replicated in Study 3 (N=163) for female avatars, in the sense that open postures in nurses increased empathy ratings and decreased dominance ratings, which both in turn led to greater perceived competence. By contrast, for male avatars, posture did not affect attributions of competence directly. Rather, attire predicted perceived dominance directly, as well as through perceived empathy. The present findings suggest that both posture, and occupational information evoked by attire, are used to infer personal characteristics. However, the strength of each cue may vary with the gender of the target.","2019-03","2021-05-19 13:30:27","2021-05-19 13:30:27","","23-38","","1","43","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article","","","","","Dominance; Empathy; Body posture; Clothing; Competence; Occupational stereotypes; Warmth","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

If a robot can identify emotions and intentions of a human interacting with it, interactions with humans can potentially become more natural and effective. However, mechanisms of perception and empathy used by humans to achieve this understanding may not be suitable or adequate for use within robots. Electroencephalography (EEG) can be used for recording signals revealing emotions and motivations from a human brain. This study aimed to evaluate different machine learning techniques to classify EEG data associated with specific affective/emotional states. For experimental purposes, we used visual (IAPS) and physical (Tower of Hanoi) tasks to record human emotional states in the form of EEG data. The obtained EEG data processed, formatted and evaluated using various machine learning techniques to find out which method can most accurately classify EEG data according to associated affective/emotional states. The experiment confirms the choice of a method for improving the accuracy of results. According to the results, Support Vector Machine was the first, and Regression Tree was the second best method for classifying EEG data associated with specific affective/emotional states with accuracies up to 70.00% and 60.00%, respectively.

In this paper, we evaluate the possibility of stress and emotion monitoring using off-the-shelf wearable sensors. To this aim, we propose a multi-modal machine-learning technique for acute stress episodes detection, by fusing the information careered in several biosignals and wearable sensors. Further-more, we investigate the contribution of each wearable sensor in stress detection and demonstrate the possibility of acute stress recognition using wearable devices. In particular, we acquire the physiological signals using the Shimmer3 ECG Unit and the Empatica E4 wristband.

Here, we demonstrate that these two types of seizures can be discriminated based on signals related to autonomic nervous system activity recorded via wearable sensors. We used Empatica E4 Wristband sensors worn on both arms in vEEG confirmed seizures, and machine learning methods to train classifiers, specifically, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). Classification performance achieved a predictive accuracy of 78 +/- 1.5% on previously unseen data for whether a seizure was epileptic or psychogenic, which is 6 standard deviations above the baseline of 68% accuracy. Our dataset contained altogether 35 seizures from 18 patients out of which 8 patients had 13 convulsive seizures. Prediction of seizure type was based on simple features derived from the segments of autonomic activity measurements (electrodermal activity, body temperature, blood volume pulse, and heart rate) and forearm acceleration. Features related to heart rate and electrodermal activity were ranked as the top predictors in XGBoost classifiers. We found that patients with PNES had a higher ictal heart rate and electrodermal activity than patients with ES. In contrast to existing published studies of mainly convulsive seizures, our classifier focuses on autonomic signals to differentiate convulsive or nonconvulsive semiology ES from PNES. Our results show that autonomic activity recorded via wearable sensors provides promising signals for detection and discrimination of psychogenic and epileptic seizures, but more work is necessary to improve the predictive power of the model.","2019","2021-05-19 13:30:28","2021-05-19 13:30:28","","3502-3506","","","","","","","IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings","","","","IEEE","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","English","","","","","","","ISSN: 1557-170X Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>41st Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC), Berlin, GERMANY, JUL 23-27, 2019</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The system is inspired by advances in biosensing wearables, tattoo displays, brain sensors, robotic agents, artificial intelligence (Al), gestural interaction and 3D holographic displays. By 2030, technological advances will enable us to prototype and investigate questions related to experiential and embodied emotional learning; emotion-based human-computer interaction, affective biosensing, empathetic Al agents, and 3D interactive holographic environments. We envision EmotoTent as a modular, emotion sensing Holodeck. In the EmotoTent program children learn and practice emotion regulation and empathy with peers, pets and a robotic dog agent in ways that are experiential, embodied and playful. We propose EmotoTent as a core element of a K-6 socio-emotional learning curriculum designed to improve school culture through the enhancement of children's ability to regulate emotions and interact with human and non-human species with empathy and compassion. Enhancing these qualities has been shown to lead to reductions in violence and bullying, racism, gender inequality and other forms of marginalization. We predict that the EmotoTent socio-emotional learning program will improve school cultures and create a foundation for children's lifelong well-being.","2019","2021-05-19 13:30:29","2021-05-19 13:30:29","","755-760","","","","","","","","","","","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: Boise State Univ; Stem Act Ctr; St Lukes; Osmo; Langan Barber Fdn; Discovery Ctr Idaho; StemFinity; NSF; Boise Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>18th Annual ACM Interaction Design and Children (IDC), Boise, ID, JUN 12-15, 2019</p>","","","","biosensing; children; embodied learning; Empathy; experiential learning; holographic environments; mind-body interaction; robotic agents","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In doing so, the requirements analyst is supported during the requirements elicitation interview because conveying the emotional range of the stakeholder can help eliminate any miscommunication or misunderstandings between the requirements analyst and the stakeholder due to ambiguity in questions, statements, and responses. Therefore, knowing the range of the emotional state of the stakeholder, in real-time, can allow the requirements analyst to recover or make adjustments to questions (i.e. sensitive topics) during the requirements elicitation interview. The main questions are: (1) What machine learning technique(s) would be most efficient in conveying the emotional range of the stakeholder through the voice recording data and biofeedback data? (2) What features would result in optimal performance from the chosen machine learning technique(s)? The objective is to use supervised machine learning techniques in order to convey an emotional range from the retrieved dataset. To accomplish this, exploring the most efficient machine learning technique for emotion detection for voice recordings and biofeedback data and finding a way to construct or utilize the techniques in an effective manner will be necessary. In conclusion, the machine learning technique(s) chosen will convey a range of emotion from the stakeholder based on the retrieved data. The machine learning technique(s) will be used to support a requirements analyst during requirements elicitation interviews and will help the analyst identify problems or concerns in the communication to better assess and engage the stakeholder.","2019","2021-05-19 13:30:34","2021-05-19 13:30:34","","266-267","","","","","","","","","","","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: ACM Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>Annual ACM Southeast Conference (ACMSE), Kennesaw State Univ, Kennesaw, GA, APR 18-20, 2019</p>","","","","Neural Networks; Machine Learning; Biofeedback Data; Datasets; Regression; Voice Recording Data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this regard, human-robot interaction can be improved through the automatic perception of empathy, among other human attributes, allowing robots to affectively adapt their actions to interactants' feelings in any given situation. This paper presents our contribution to the generalised track of the One-Minute Gradual ( OMG) Empathy Prediction Challenge by describing our approach to predict a listener's valence during semi-scripted actor-listener interactions. We extract visual and acoustic features from the interactions and feed them into a bidirectional long short-term memory network to capture the time-dependencies of the valence-based empathy during the interactions. Generalised and personalised unimodal and multimodal valence-based empathy models are then trained to assess the impact of each modality on the system performance. Furthermore, we analyse if intra-subject dependencies on empathy perception affect the system performance. We assess the models by computing the concordance correlation coefficient ( CCC) between the predicted and self-annotated valence scores. The results support the suitability of employing multimodal data to recognise participants' valence-based empathy during the interactions, and highlight the subject-dependency of empathy. In particular, we obtained our best result with a personalised multimodal model, which achieved a CCC of 0.11 on the test set.","2019","2021-05-19 13:30:35","2021-05-19 13:30:35","","721-725","","","","","","","IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition and Workshops","","","","IEEE","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: IEEE; Univ Lille; Inst Mines Telecom; Univ Lille, Inst Mines Telecom, Ecole Mines Telecom, IMT Lille Douai; INRIA; 3DMD; Google; I Site Univ Lille Nord Europe; Centre Rech Informatique Signal Automatique Lille; IEEE Comp Soc; IEEE Biometr Council ISSN: 2326-5396 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>14th IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition (FG), Lille, FRANCE, MAY 14-18, 2019</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Automated technologies are finding themselves more and more integrated into every aspect of the fight. As technology continues to advance, the United States Military must consider what a human-machine team will look like and how an optimal relationship between the two assets can be formed, especially under the stressful conditions that often characterize military contexts. For a human-machine team in a military context to work at maximum efficiency, an ideal level of empathy towards an automated teammate must be obtained. The goal of this study is to determine the effect stress can have on an individual's empathetic reaction toward a Pepper robot. Twenty-eight participants interacted with a Pepper robot either under stress or not. Empathy toward the robot was measured through subjective assessments as well as by participant decisions to continue interacting with Pepper even though doing so would harm the robot. Although not conclusive, the results suggest an interaction between participant gender and stress on empathy toward the Pepper robot. Women showed more empathy toward Pepper under higher levels of stress than lower levels of stress. However, the opposite was true for men. Men showed less empathy toward Pepper under higher levels of stress. The results of this study could help to inform military training and robot design.","2019","2021-05-19 13:30:36","2021-05-19 13:30:36","","170-175","","","","","","","IEEE Systems and Information Engineering Design Symposium","","","","IEEE","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","English","","","","","","","ISSN: 2639-7439 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>Systems and Information Engineering Design Symposium (SIEDS), Univ Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, APR 26, 2019</p>","","","","Human-robot interaction; Human-machine teaming","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

ATEC has two alternate training phases: supervised training and transfer training. In the supervised training stage, we train the CVAE model, a content discriminator and an emotional classifier based on ground truth corpus. And in the transfer training stage, we change the target emotion and use the content discriminator to force the model to transfer the multi-turn context information, while the emotional classifier regularizes the emotions expressed in the generated responses. Experiments show that the proposed approach achieves state of the art performance with diverse responses and accurate emotional expression.","2019","2021-05-19 13:30:37","2021-05-19 13:30:37","","106-110","","","","","","","","","","","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA","English","","","","","","","Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>3rd International Conference on Innovation in Artificial Intelligence (ICIAI), Suzhou, PEOPLES R CHINA, MAR 15-18, 2019</p>","","","","conditional variational autoencoders; emotion transfer; Emotional dialogue system","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our work seeks to bridge the gap between these expectations and reality by designing a fun learning experience with several goals: explaining how chatbots work by mapping utterances to a set of intents, teaching strategies for avoiding conversational breakdowns, and increasing desire to use chatbots by creating feelings of empathy toward them. Our experience, called BigBlueBot, consists of interactions with two chatbots in which breakdowns occur and the user (or chatbot) must recover using one or more repair strategies.

Theoretical Rationale and Proposal of a Randomized Controlled Trial","NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND REDESIGNING LEARNING SPACES, VOL I","","","10.12753/2066-026X-19-011","","Perspective-taking is a core theory of mind process, entailing the ability to understand and predict others' mental states. While the literature suggests that priming a perspective-taking stance increases empathic concern and intergroup cohesion and reduces implicit negative attitudes such as racial bias and prejudice, no study up to date has attempted to foster perspective-taking implicitly, by training visual perspective-taking in a computerized task. In the current paper, we propose a computerized, gamified intervention for visual perspective-taking in adolescents and young adults. The intervention is an adapted version of extant visual perspective-taking assessment protocols and is envisioned to train participants to selectively attend to the visual perspective of an animated avatar, instead of their own. By training an allocentric bias, the intervention aims to increase empathic and theory of mind abilities and to foster interpersonal communication and cohesion. An additionally hypothesized benefit of the intervention is a decrease in self-focused attention, a marker of social anxiety disorder. As such, the intervention is suited to address two different, but inter-related needs: optimizing social functioning and managing social anxiety symptomatology. Introducing users to gamification elements, such as earning badges, advancing through increasing difficulty levels, receiving feedback and leaderboards highlighting achievements, is intended to increase the intervention's efficacy and to promote adherence. Design considerations for testing the intervention in an experimental trial will additionally be proposed, with the intervention contrasted against a sham control condition that will equally train egocentric and allocentric biases in visual perspective-taking. Theoretical and practical implications for educational settings will be discussed.","2019","2021-05-19 13:30:39","2021-05-19 13:30:39","","91-97","","","","","","","eLearning and Software for Education","","","","CAROL I NATL DEFENCE UNIV PUBLISHING HOUSE","PANDURI ST, 68-72, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: European Secur & Def Coll; Romania Partnership Ctr; Natl Def Univ Carol I ISSN: 2066-026X Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>15th International Scientific Conference on eLearning and Software for Education (eLSE) - New Technologies and Redesigning Learning Spaces, Bucharest, ROMANIA, APR 11-12, 2019</p>","","","","perspective-taking; theory of mind; computerized; gamification; training","Roceanu, I and Belgian, D and Stefan, IA and Moldoveanu, A and Matu, ST","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We focused on the pupil response which is closely related to human affect, and developed an embodied communication system in which an interactive CG character generates the pupil response as well as communicative actions and movements such as nodding and body movements by speech input. In addition, it was confirmed that the pupil response is effective for supporting the embodied interaction and communication using the developed system.

Approach: content analysis of Australian accountancy schools' courses placed on the web followed by direct contact with schools whose Web descriptions might plausibly have indicated listening skills' inclusion; Findings: while the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia and CPA Australia required in their Professional Accounting Guidelines, 2009' that as a condition of their accreditation higher education programs address `generic skills' including the interpersonal, `particularly the ability to listen effectively', this was scarcely complied with by accredited schools. Subsequent to the 2009 ICAA/CPA directive successive pronouncements of the Institutions reduced or effectively eliminated the requirement to teach listening skills. Practical implications: accountancy graduates will enter the profession without groundwork in a skill which successful exponents will increasingly be required to exercise. This will need to be remedied. Originality value: empathetic listening skills are seen to be indispensable by reference to the demands of a party not considered in previous studies, namely practising accountants' clients.

Although much work in human-robot interaction describes the meaningful relationships that humans forge with their robots in one-on-one encounters, when robots venture into places where humans cannot go - in search and rescue operations, ocean voyages, or even into space - they do so as part of a large human team. Decisions about what the robot should do and where it should go are therefore the result of large group interactions instead of individual human cognition: the realm of organizational sociology. This talk draws on over a decade of ethnography with NASA's robotic spacecraft missions, specifically focusing on the Mars Exploration Rover mission. Going behind the scenes of the mission, I show the meaning-making, emotional connections, and embodied synergy that scientists develop as they work with their robots millions of miles away on a daily basis. This begins by learning to see through the robots' “eyes” on another planet, yet the peculiar social arrangement of mission work produces a deeper connection to the robot explorers too: one that is no doubt responsible for the extraordinary success and unexpected longevity of the mission team. Studying robotic spacecraft teams demonstrates how humans build a particular and peculiar empathy with their robotic colleagues that goes beyond anthropomorphism. Instead, this case points to the many and unusual ways in which organizations participate in our interactions with, understanding of, and ultimately care for the robots we work with in everyday life.","2019","2021-05-19 13:30:41","2021-05-19 13:30:41","","152","","","","","","","ACM IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction","","","","IEEE","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: Assoc Comp Machinery; IEEE; IEEE Robot & Automat Soc; ACM SIGCHI; ACM SIGAI; AAAI; Korea Tourism Org; Daegu Convent & Visitors Bur; ColorfulDaegu ISSN: 2167-2121 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>14th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), Daegu, SOUTH KOREA, MAR 11-14, 2019</p>","","","","Teamwork; Human-Robot Interaction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Just as between people, some robots learn about people and adapt to them. In this paper we present one such robot design: we developed Sam, a robot that learns minimal information about a person's background, and adapts to this background. Our in-the-wild study found that people helped Sam for significantly longer when it adapted to match their background. While initially we saw this as a success, in re-considering our study we started seeing a different angle. Our robot effectively deceived people ( changed its story and text), based on some knowledge of their background, to get more work from them. There was little direct benefit to the person from this adaptation, yet the robot stood to gain free labor. We would like to pose the question to the community: is this simply good robot design, or, is our robot being manipulative? Where does the ethical line lay between a robot leveraging social techniques to improve interaction, and the more negative framing of a robot or algorithm taking advantage of people?

Future robots will be highly dependent on the ability to understand, interpret, and generate a representation of the environment in which they are operating, ideally in both a human and machine-readable formalism. An important element in this process lies in Path Planning (PP) with obstacle avoidance in dynamic environments (including cleaning and monitoring in robotics) to identify optimal coverage paths. The study in this paper presents a new approach which combines knowledge reasoning techniques with Breadth First Search to find the optimal path for a cleaning robot in a dynamic environment. This approach is used to apply knowledge inference with conventional coverage PP algorithms to enable robot control and avoid obstacles with optimal coverage PP. The experimental results show that using the proposed approach a robot avoids fixed and mobile obstacles, optimal PP reducing both computational cost and time. When compared to other current approaches, the proposed approach with high-coverage rate and low-repetition rate in coverage performs better than the conventional robot algorithms.","2019","2021-05-19 13:30:44","2021-05-19 13:30:44","","57-64","","1","60","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: WORLD TRADE CENTER BLDG, 29 ROUTE DE PRE-BOIS, CASE POSTALE 856, CH-1215 GENEVA, SWITZERLAND Publisher: INDERSCIENCE ENTERPRISES LTD Type: Article","","","","","automated reasoning techniques; breadth first search; coverage path planning; optimal robot path","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While basic design is focused on the development of new products for the individual, working towards a more sustainable world demands greater attention to designing for and with communities. Improving design education and examining design-learning outcomes requires a kind of targeted approach that could match the best practices to personalize student learning. Design is complex and design includes balancing the needs of multiple stakeholders. However, there is a gap in the preparation of design education that will be needed in a challenging environment. This paper reviews the history of design thinking in the engineering curriculum. Design thinking education starts with an understanding of its importance with socioeconomic relevance. Through observation and empathy, mapping the designer uses the listening and learning tools for mapping users unarticulated needs, working in a team environment. The designer takes time to think carefully why a certain project is considered and details which aspects of machine learning application can be applied from functional to complete success for the end users. The availability of powerful virtual reality methodologies, have made it possible to consider the realistic needs and visualize scenarios and to explore the design alternatives with new ideas before full scale resource allocation on new ideas. Mid-to-advanced level courses with experimental assignments require that students apply through experimentation the principles and concepts learned in foundation courses. The basic design tools such as axiomatic thinking, theory of inventive problem solving, design iteration and simulation using hardware-in-the loop are discussed with case studies. Consideration of product sustainability with the thoughts of design for disassembly and disposal has emerged as a major part of design thinking. Senior engineering courses center on cross and interdisciplinary design and capstone experiences so that students experience fully guided practice of device design and problem solving, simulating what they are likely to experience in the world. This paper examines the critical issues of design thinking in a curriculum from observation, empathy mapping, validation of the idea, and improvement of idea by virtual reality and machine learning, optimization of the idea by tools such as axiomatic design, hardware in the loop simulation, and finally examining product sustainability causes.","2019","2021-05-19 13:30:44","2021-05-19 13:30:44","","","","","","","","","","","","","AMER SOC MECHANICAL ENGINEERS","THREE PARK AVENUE, NEW YORK, NY 10016-5990 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: Amer Soc Mech Engineers Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>ASMEInternational Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition (IMECE2018), Pittsburgh, PA, NOV 09-15, 2018</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Currently, we investigated if the presence of a facial wound enhanced the perception of mental capacities (experience and agency) in response to images of robotic and human-like avatars, compared with unharmed avatars. The results revealed that harmed versions of both robotic and human-like avatars were imbued with mind to a higher degree, irrespective of the baseline level of mind attributed to their unharmed counterparts. Perceptions of capacity for pain mediated attributions of experience, while both pain and empathy mediated attributions of abilities linked to agency.

Major depression is associated with impaired psychosocial functioning and reduced quality of life. Challenges such as shortage of mental health personnel, long waiting times, perceived stigma, and lower government spends pose barriers to the alleviation of mental health problems. Face-to-face psychotherapy alone provides only point-in-time support and cannot scale quickly enough to address this growing global public health challenge. Artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled, empathetic, and evidence-driven conversational mobile app technologies could play an active role in filling this gap by increasing adoption and enabling reach. Although such a technology can help manage these barriers, they should never replace time with a health care professional for more severe mental health problems. However, app technologies could act as a supplementary or intermediate support system. Mobile mental well-being apps need to uphold privacy and foster both short- and long-term positive outcomes. Objective: This study aimed to present a preliminary real-world data evaluation of the effectiveness and engagement levels of an AI-enabled, empathetic, text-based conversational mobile mental well-being app, Wysa, on users with self-reported symptoms of depression. Methods: In the study, a group of anonymous global users were observed who voluntarily installed the Wysa app, engaged in text-based messaging, and self-reported symptoms of depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. On the basis of the extent of app usage on and between 2 consecutive screening time points, 2 distinct groups of users (high users and low users) emerged. The study used mixed-methods approach to evaluate the impact and engagement levels among these users. The quantitative analysis measured the app impact by comparing the average improvement in symptoms of depression between high and low users. The qualitative analysis measured the app engagement and experience by analyzing in-app user feedback and evaluated the performance of a machine learning classifier to detect user objections during conversations. Results: The average mood improvement (ie, difference in pre- and post-self-reported depression scores) between the groups (ie, high vs low users; n=108 and n=21, respectively) revealed that the high users group had significantly higher average improvement (mean 5.84 [SD 6.66]) compared with the low users group (mean 3.52 [SD 6.15]); Mann-Whitney P=.03 and with a moderate effect size of 0.63. Moreover, 67.7% of user-provided feedback responses found the app experience helpful and encouraging. Conclusions: The real-world data evaluation findings on the effectiveness and engagement levels of Wysa app on users with self-reported symptoms of depression show promise. However, further work is required to validate these initial findings in much larger samples and across longer periods.","2018-11","2021-05-19 13:30:47","2021-05-19 13:30:47","","","","11","6","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 59 WINNERS CIRCLE, TORONTO, ON M4L 3Y7, CANADA Publisher: JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC Type: Article","","","","","resilience; artificial intelligence; emotions; depression; empathy; conversational agents; mental health; chatbots; coping skills; mHealth; psychological","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One of the reasons for its increasing growth is the structural/market-level factors (known as media factors). Although India is a growing technology hub, there have been limited efforts to identify the media multitasking behaviour among the youth in this country. Thus, this study attempts to analyse the prevalence of media multitasking behaviour among the Indian college students and its relationship with their emotions through two methods: self-report and an android-based application known as `Affective Media Landscape Survey' (AMLS). Previous studies have reported that continuous interaction with media diminishes face-to-face interaction, reduces empathy and increases the tendency to live in the virtual world. This raises the concern for emotional differences in everyday life, if any, between the high and low groups of media multitaskers. So the second objective of the study is to understand the emotional profile of the users that varies among media multitasking index. To achieve these objectives, the same two methods, the `self-report' that involves questionnaires and AMLS (an android-based app to study the frequency of media multitasking behaviour and the emotions of the users) have been employed. The study gives an insight into the emerging behavioural patterns and hence is helpful for designing communities to cater to the growing needs of the young media users.","2018-11","2021-05-19 13:30:47","2021-05-19 13:30:47","","197-211","","3","13","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 2455 ℡LER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA Publisher: SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC Type: Article","","","","","emotions; Affective media landscape survey; media factors; media multitasking index","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Two groups of neurotypical children aged 6 years on average composed the population: one Japanese (n = 20) and one French (n = 20). Revealing potential similarities in communicative exchanges in both groups when in contact with a human or a toy robot, the results might signify that emotional empathy requires the implication of an automatic identification. In this sense, emotional empathy might be considered a broad idiosyncrasy, a kind of synchronisation, offering the mind a peculiar form of communication.

Recently, cognitive science and artificial intelligence communities made attempts to model empathy in artificial agents, which can provide means to test these models and hypotheses. A computational model of empathy not only would help to advance the technological artifacts to be more socially compatible, but also understand the empathy mechanisms, test theories, and address the ethics and morality problems the Artificial Intelligence (AI) community is facing today.

Or, should it show sympathy and empathize with our situation? Although expression of caring and understanding is valued in supportive human communications, do we want the same from a chatbot, or do we simply reject it due to its artificiality and uncanniness? To answer this question, we conducted two experiments with a chatbot providing online medical information advice about a sensitive personal issue. In Study 1, participants (N=158) simply read a dialogue between a chatbot and a human user. In Study 2, participants (N=88) interacted with a real chatbot. We tested the effect of three types of empathic expressionsympathy, cognitive empathy, and affective empathyon individuals' perceptions of the service and the chatbot. Data reveal that expression of sympathy and empathy is favored over unemotional provision of advice, in support of the Computers are Social Actors (CASA) paradigm. This is particularly true for users who are initially skeptical about machines possessing social cognitive capabilities. Theoretical, methodological, and practical implications are discussed.","2018-10","2021-05-19 13:30:49","2021-05-19 13:30:49","","625-636","","10","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 140 HUGUENOT STREET, 3RD FL, NEW ROCHELLE, NY 10801 USA Publisher: MARY ANN LIEBERT, INC Type: Article","","","","","empathy; human-robot interaction; CASA; sympathy; uncanny valley","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Importantly, this neural mirroring is not constant; rather, it is modulated by our beliefs about their intentions, circumstances, and group allegiances. We investigated if the neural empathic response is modulated by minimally-differentiating information (e.g., a simple text label indicating another's religious belief), and if neural activity changes predict ingroups and outgroups across independent paradigms. We found that the empathic response was larger when participants viewed a painful event occurring to a hand labeled with their own religion (ingroup) than to a hand labeled with a different religion (outgroup). Counterintuitively, the magnitude of this bias correlated positively with the magnitude of participants' self-reported empathy. A multivariate classifier, using mean activity in empathy-related brain regions as features, discriminated ingroup from outgroup with 72% accuracy; the classifier's confidence correlated with belief certainty. This classifier generalized successfully to validation experiments in which the ingroup condition was based on an arbitrary group assignment. Empathy networks thus allow for the classification of long-held, newly-modified and arbitrarily-formed ingroups and outgroups. This is the first report of a single machine learning model on neural activation that generalizes to multiple representations of ingroup and outgroup. The current findings may prove useful as an objective diagnostic tool to measure the magnitude of one's group affiliations, and the effectiveness of interventions to reduce ingroup biases.","2018-07-31","2021-05-19 13:30:49","2021-05-19 13:30:49","","","","","12","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND Publisher: FRONTIERS MEDIA SA Type: Article","","","","","machine learning; social neuroscience; pain; empathy; affect; ingroup; mind reading; religion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This process is largely dependent on the designer to identify and relate psychological and consumer level factors to engineered product attributes. In this way, current methodologies lack provision to test a designer's cognitive reasoning and may introduce bias through the mapping process. Prior work on Cyber-Empathic Design (CED) supports this mapping by relating user-product interaction data from embedded sensors to psychological constructs. To understand consumer perceptions, a network of psychological constructs is developed using Structural Equation Modeling for parameter estimation and hypothesis testing, making the framework falsifiable in nature. The focus of this technical brief is toward automating CED through unsupervised deep learning to extract features from raw data. Additionally, Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modeling is used with extracted sensor features as inputs. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach a case study involving sensor-integrated shoes compares three models - a survey-only model (no sensor data), the existing CED approach with manually extracted sensor features, and the proposed deep learning based CED approach.

A growing number of electroencephalography studies also suggest that it might be useful to assess empathy. The main goal of this study was to use quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) to test whether observation of pain expressed by an avatar (virtual reality) induces a suppression of alpha waves over sensorimotor cortical areas, as it is observed with human stimuli. Not only was it the case, but also the magnitude of alpha suppression was correlated with perspective-taking capacity of participants. Both empathy levels and magnitude of sensorimotor alpha suppression (SAS) were significantly higher in women than men. Interestingly, a significant interaction emerged between levels of individual empathy and specificity of experimental instructions, where SAS in participants with good perspective-taking was higher during passive observation of the distressed avatar, while the opposite was true during an active (trying to understand) condition. These results suggest that: (1) synthetic characters are able to elicit SAS; (2) SAS is indeed associated with perspective-taking capacities; (3) Persons with poorer perspective-taking capacities can show significant SAS when proper instructions are provided. Therefore, qEEG represents a low-cost objective approach to measure perspective-taking abilities.","2018-07-09","2021-05-19 13:30:50","2021-05-19 13:30:50","","","","","12","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND Publisher: FRONTIERS MEDIA SA Type: Article","","","","","electroencephalography; empathy; perspective taking; assessment; avatar; alpha suppression; qEEG","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To manipulate participants' gender in the virtual environment, we randomly assigned them to one of three avatars (female, male, or robot). Using a screen recording device, we measured the percentage of time participants spent interacting with empathizing (e.g., options for shopping, telephone) and systemizing (e.g., weapons, options for building) objects in a virtual reality house that we constructed to reflect evidence put forth by the differences perspective. Because we derived competing hypotheses we expected to find support for either the similarities perspective or the differences perspective; however, our results suggested support for both. Consistent with the differences perspective hypotheses, participants paid attention to objects in the environment that were consistent with the social representation of their own gender. However, our results were consistent with the similarities perspective hypotheses, such that the avatars' gender also played a role in the percentage of time participants spent interacting with empathizing and systemizing objects. Therefore, we conclude that observable differences between men and women are the consequence of both biological and social forces, and research should focus on the interaction between the two as etiologies and explanations for sex and gender differences and similarities.

It is concluded that attention to relationality and to verbal and non-verbal languages of suffering is key to understand the phenomenon under investigation, and that in robot ethics we need less certainty and more caution and patience when it comes to thinking about moral standing.","2018-06","2021-05-19 13:30:51","2021-05-19 13:30:51","","141-158","","1","20","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: DE GRUYTER POLAND SP Z O O, BOGUMILA ZUGA 32A STR, 01-811 WARSAW, POLAND Publisher: SCIENDO Type: Article","","","","","robots; empathy; language; phenomenology; art; hermeneutics; moral standing; relations; Wittgenstein","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We develop a theory of AI job replacement to address this double-edged impact. The theory specifies four intelligences required for service tasks-mechanical, analytical, intuitive, and empathetic-and lays out the way firms should decide between humans and machines for accomplishing those tasks. AI is developing in a predictable order, with mechanical mostly preceding analytical, analytical mostly preceding intuitive, and intuitive mostly preceding empathetic intelligence. The theory asserts that AI job replacement occurs fundamentally at the task level, rather than the job level, and for “lower” (easier for AI) intelligence tasks first. AI first replaces some of a service job's tasks, a transition stage seen as augmentation, and then progresses to replace human labor entirely when it has the ability to take over all of a job's tasks. The progression of AI task replacement from lower to higher intelligences results in predictable shifts over time in the relative importance of the intelligences for service employees. An important implication from our theory is that analytical skills will become less important, as AI takes over more analytical tasks, giving the “softer” intuitive and empathetic skills even more importance for service employees. Eventually, AI will be capable of performing even the intuitive and empathetic tasks, which enables innovative ways of human-machine integration for providing service but also results in a fundamental threat for human employment.","2018-05","2021-05-19 13:30:53","2021-05-19 13:30:53","","155-172","","2","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 2455 ℡LER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA Publisher: SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC Type: Article","","","","","artificial intelligence; machine learning; analytical intelligence; automation; economics; empathetic intelligence; human intelligence; human resources; intuitive intelligence; mechanical intelligence; replacement; robots; service strategy; singularity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study addressed a key challenge for the goal of developing social robotic motivational interviewers: creating an interview protocol, within the constraints of current artificial intelligence, which participants will find engaging and helpful. Objective: The aim of this study was to explore participants' qualitative experiences of a motivational interview delivered by a social robot, including their evaluation of usability of the robot during the interaction and its impact on their motivation. Methods: NAO robots are humanoid, child-sized social robots. We programmed a NAO robot with Choregraphe software to deliver a scripted motivational interview focused on increasing physical activity. The interview was designed to be comprehensible even without an empathetic response from the robot. Robot breathing and face-tracking functions were used to give an impression of attentiveness. A total of 20 participants took part in the robot-delivered motivational interview and evaluated it after 1 week by responding to a series of written open-ended questions. Each participant was left alone to speak aloud with the robot, advancing through a series of questions by tapping the robot's head sensor. Evaluations were content-analyzed utilizing Boyatzis' steps: (1) sampling and design, (2) developing themes and codes, and (3) validating and applying the codes. Results: Themes focused on interaction with the robot, motivation, change in physical activity, and overall evaluation of the intervention. Participants found the instructions clear and the navigation easy to use. Most enjoyed the interaction but also found it was restricted by the lack of individualized response from the robot. Many positively appraised the nonjudgmental aspect of the interview and how it gave space to articulate their motivation for change. Some participants felt that the intervention increased their physical activity levels. Conclusions: Social robots can achieve a fundamental objective of motivational interviewing, encouraging participants to articulate their goals and dilemmas aloud. Because they are perceived as nonjudgmental, robots may have advantages over more humanoid avatars for delivering virtual support for behavioral change.","2018-05","2021-05-19 13:30:53","2021-05-19 13:30:53","","","","5","20","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 59 WINNERS CIRCLE, TORONTO, ON M4L 3Y7, CANADA Publisher: JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC Type: Article","","","","","qualitative research; robotics; motivational interviewing; motivation; counseling; computer-assisted therapy; exercise; person-centered therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This might be understood in an evolutionary context. Intense emotional tearing increases tear film volume and disturbs tear layer uniformity, resulting in blurry vision. A constriction of the pupils may help to mitigate this handicap, which in turn may have resulted in a perceptual association of both signals. However, direct empirical evidence for a role of pupil size in tearful emotional crying is still lacking. The present study examined socioemotional responses to different pupil sizes, combined with the presence ( absence) of digitally added tears superimposed upon expressively neutral faces. Data from 50 subjects showed significant effects of observing digitally added tears in avatars, replicating previous findings for increased perceived sadness elicited by tearful photographs. No significant interactions were found between tears and pupil size. However, small pupils likewise elicited a significantly greater wish to help in observers. Further analysis showed a significant serial mediation of the effects of tears on perceived wish to help via perceived and then felt sadness. For pupil size, only felt sadness emerged as a significant mediator of the wish to help. These findings support the notion that pupil constriction in the context of intense sadness may function to counteract blurry vision. Pupil size, like emotional tears, appears to have acquired value as a social signal in this context.","2018-03-12","2021-05-19 13:30:54","2021-05-19 13:30:54","","","","1","16","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 2455 ℡LER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA Publisher: SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC Type: Article","","","","","prosocial behavior; emotional tears; handicap; pupil mimicry; pupil size; sadness processing; signaling; visual acuity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, this study set out to examine social avoidance tendencies and prosocial behaviors towards human controlled (avatars) and computer controlled entities (agents). A total of N = 95 healthy young adults were randomly assigned to an avatar or agent condition. Participants were exposed to a virtual stranger asking to sit at the table (prosocial behavior) as well as a virtual waiter handing over the false drink (social avoidance). Empathy, interaction anxiety, social and physical presence as well as subjective stress levels were assessed to control for confounding influences. Empathy emerged as a significant predictor of prosocial behavior. Social avoidance, in turn, was not predicted by any of the included variables. Also, there was no effect of agency on social presence, physical presence, social interaction anxiety and stress. Yet, participants showed significantly more social avoidance and prosocial behavior towards avatars. These seemingly contradictory results may be explained by an extension of prior theories: While intuitive responses (e.g., stress) follow the Media Equation Concept (Nass & Moon, 2000), more complex processes (e.g., empathy) may modulate agency dependent responses.

For the first time, immersive virtual reality was used to place parents in the position of a child in order to assess impact on perspective-taking and empathy.

Mothers were virtually embodied as a 4-year-old child, experienced from the first-person perspective and with virtual and real body movements synchronised. They interacted with a `mother avatar', which responded either in a Positive or Negative way. Participants reported a strong body ownership illusion for the child body that led to cognitive, emotional and physical reactions. Experiencing negative maternal behavior increased levels of empathy. In addition, the Negative mother led to increased feelings of fear of violence. Physiological data indicated greater stress in the Negative than Positive condition. Although further research is required to assess the effectiveness of such methods, any improvement in empathy that leads to a change in parenting behavior has the potential to impact on developmental outcomes for children.","2018-02-14","2021-05-19 13:30:55","2021-05-19 13:30:55","","","","","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND Publisher: NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the last few decades, this has become a reality with enormous advances in hardware performance, computer graphics, robotics technology, and artificial intelligence. New interdisciplinary research fields have brought forth cognitive robotics aimed at building a new generation of control systems and providing robots with social, empathetic and affective capabilities. This paper presents the design, implementation, and test of a human-inspired cognitive architecture for social robots. State-of-the-art design approaches and methods are thoroughly analyzed and discussed, cases where the developed system has been successfully used are reported. The tests demonstrated the system's ability to endow a social humanoid robot with human social behaviors and with in-silico robotic emotions.","2018-02","2021-05-19 13:30:55","2021-05-19 13:30:55","","","","2","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND Publisher: MDPI Type: Article","","","","","social cognition; social robot; cognitive architecture; humanoid; human-inspired robot; robot mind","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Social cues are an important factor in this context. This work investigates, if emotional adaptation still works under absence of human-like facial Action Units. A human-robot dialog scenario is chosen using NAO pretending to work for a supermarket and involving humans providing object names to the robot for training purposes. In a user study, two conditions are implemented with or without explicit emotional adaptation of NAO to the human user in a between-subjects design. Evaluations of user experience and acceptance are conducted based on evaluated measures of human-robot interaction (HRI). The results of the user study reveal a significant increase of helpfulness (number of named objects), anthropomorphism, and empathy in the explicit emotional adaptation condition even without social cues of facial Action Units, but only in case of prior robot contact of the test persons. Otherwise, an opposite effect is found. These findings suggest, that reduction of these social cues can be overcome by robot experience prior to the interaction task, e.g. realizable by an additional bonding phase, confirming the importance of such from previous work. Additionally, an interaction with academic background of the participants is found.","2018","2021-05-19 13:30:56","2021-05-19 13:30:56","","275-281","","","","","","","IEEE RO-MAN","","","","IEEE","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: IEEE; IEEE Robot & Automat Soc; Robot Soc Japan; Korea Robot Soc; Nanjing Forestry Univ ISSN: 1944-9445 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>27th IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (IEEE RO-MAN), Nanjing, PEOPLES R CHINA, AUG 27-31, 2018</p>","","","","","Cabibihan, JJ and Mastrogiovanni, F and Pandey, AK and Rossi, S and Staffa, M","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As humans anthropomorphize robots, an empathetically interacting robot is expected to increase the level of acceptance of social robots. Here, a human perception experiment evaluates whether human subjects perceive empathy in robot speech. For this experiment, empathy is expressed only by adding appropriate emotions to the words in speech. Also, humans' preferences for a robot interacting with empathetic speech versus a standard robotic voice are also assessed. The results show that humans are able to perceive empathy and emotions in robot speech, and prefer it over the standard robotic voice. It is important for the emotions in empathetic speech to be consistent with the language content of what is being said, and with the human users' emotional state. Analyzing emotions in empathetic speech using valence-arousal model has revealed the importance of secondary emotions in developing empathetically speaking social robots.","2018","2021-05-19 13:30:57","2021-05-19 13:30:57","","632-637","","","","","","","IEEE RO-MAN","","","","IEEE","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: IEEE; IEEE Robot & Automat Soc; Robot Soc Japan; Korea Robot Soc; Nanjing Forestry Univ ISSN: 1944-9445 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>27th IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (IEEE RO-MAN), Nanjing, PEOPLES R CHINA, AUG 27-31, 2018</p>","","","","","Cabibihan, JJ and Mastrogiovanni, F and Pandey, AK and Rossi, S and Staffa, M","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite significant progress towards the development of empathic social agents, current social robots have yet to reach the full emotional and social capabilities. This paper presents our recent effort on incorporating an automated Facial Expression Recognition (FER) system based on deep neural networks into the spoken dialog of a social robot (Ryan) to extend and enrich its capabilities beyond spoken dialog and integrate the user's affect state into the robot's responses. In order to evaluate whether this incorporation can improve social capabilities of Ryan, we conducted a series of Human-Robot-Interaction (HRI) experiments. In these experiments the subjects watched some videos and Ryan engaged them in a conversation driven by user's facial expressions perceived by the robot. We measured the accuracy of the automated FER system on the robot when interacting with different human subjects as well as three social/interactive aspects, namely task engagement, empathy, and likability of the robot. The results of our HRI study indicate that the subjects rated empathy and likability of the affect-aware Ryan significantly higher than non-empathic (the control condition) Ryan. Interestingly, we found that the accuracy of the FER system is not a limiting factor, as subjects rated the affect-aware agent equipped with a low accuracy FER system as empathic and likable as when facial expression was recognized by a human observer.","2018","2021-05-19 13:30:58","2021-05-19 13:30:58","","783-789","","","","","","","IEEE RO-MAN","","","","IEEE","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: IEEE; IEEE Robot & Automat Soc; Robot Soc Japan; Korea Robot Soc; Nanjing Forestry Univ ISSN: 1944-9445 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>27th IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (IEEE RO-MAN), Nanjing, PEOPLES R CHINA, AUG 27-31, 2018</p>","","","","","Cabibihan, JJ and Mastrogiovanni, F and Pandey, AK and Rossi, S and Staffa, M","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This perspective may need to be reconsidered, however, if some team members are autonomous robots since establishing bonds with fundamentally inanimate and expendable objects may prove counterproductive. Previous work has measured empathic responses towards robots as singular events at the conclusion of experimental sessions. As relationships extend over long periods of time, sustained empathic behavior towards robots would be of interest. In order to measure user actions that may vary over time and are affected by empathy towards a robot teammate, we created the TEAMMATE simulation system. Our findings suggest that inducing empathy through a back story narrative can significantly change participant decisions in actions that may have consequences for a robot companion over time. The results of our study can have strong implications for the overall performance of human machine teams.","2018","2021-05-19 13:30:58","2021-05-19 13:30:58","","","","","","","","","","","","","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: Amer Psychol Assoc Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>Technology, Mind, and Society Conference (TechMindSociety), Washington, DC, APR 05-07, 2018</p>","","","","Robotics; Empathy; Anthropomorphism; Human Machine Team; User Study","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such robots, which emulate the emotive, perceptual, and empathic abilities of human teachers, are capable of replicating some of the benefits of one-on-one tutoring from human teachers, in part by leveraging individual student's behavior and task performance data to infer sophisticated models of their knowledge. These student models are then used to provide personalized educational experiences by, for example, determining the optimal sequencing of curricular material. In this paper we introduce an integrated system for autonomously analyzing and assessing children's speech and pronunciation in the context of an interactive word game between a social robot and a child. We present a novel game environment and its computational formulation, an integrated pipeline for capturing and analyzing children's speech in real-time, and an autonomous robot that models children's word pronunciation via Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), augmented with an Active Learning protocol that informs the robot's behavior. We show that the system is capable of autonomously assessing children's pronunciation ability, with ground truth determined by a post-experiment evaluation by human raters. We also compare phoneme- and word-level GPR models and discuss trade-offs of each approach in modeling children's pronunciation. Finally, we describe and analyze a pipeline for automatic analysis of children's speech and pronunciation, including an evaluation of SpeechAce as a tool for future development of autonomous, speech-based language tutors.","2018","2021-05-19 13:30:59","2021-05-19 13:30:59","","1658-1666","","","","","","","","","","","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: Assoc Comp Machinery; Int Fdn Autonomous Agents & MultiAgent Syst; NSF; Artificial Intelligence Journal; Riken; Nissan; ACM SIGAI; Springer Sci + Business Media; Elsevier; Google; AIP, Ctr Adv Intelligent Project Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>17th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and MultiAgent Systems (AAMAS), Stockholm, SWEDEN, JUL 10-15, 2018</p>","","","","Human-Robot Interaction; Social robot; Student Modeling; Intelligent Tutoring Systems; Speech-based Systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This greatly affects the accessibility of patients to proper healthcare. As a matter of fact, in 2015, 59.2% of deaths in the Philippines are attributed as deaths unattended by a doctor. Although there are current government programs, which aim to solve this problem, the use of telepresence systems can be another viable solution as doctors can still provide quality healthcare services even when located in a remote area. One limitation of medical telepresence robots is the lack of medical features. For this reason, the developed telepresence system includes a telepresence robot called Akibot with integrated medical devices such as otoscope, stethoscope, and ultrasound probe. Akibot is a highly maneuverable remotely controlled telepresence robot designed for general practice medical consultation between doctors and a patient on a remote area. Akibot has an empathic exterior with 4.6 out of 5 rating on its perceived quality of appearance and is equipped with modular medical devices and highly customizable screen, tested on an Android and Windows OS.","2018","2021-05-19 13:31:00","2021-05-19 13:31:00","","","","","","","","","IEEE International Conference on Humanoid Nanotechnology Information Technology Communication and Control Environment and Management","","","","IEEE","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: IEEE ISSN: 2475-7152 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>10th IEEE International Conference on Humanoid, Nanotechnology, Information Technology, Communication and Control, Environment and Management (HNICEM), Baguio City, PHILIPPINES, NOV 29-DEC 02, 2018</p>","","","","general practice medical consultation; human-centered robot design; teleconsultation; telepresence robot","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many studies have been completed to evaluate the signal quality obtained by these sensors but without focusing on their emotion recognition capabilities. In the current study, Machine Learning models were trained to compare the Biopac MP150 (laboratory sensor) and Empatica E4 (wearable sensor) in terms of emotion recognition accuracy. Results show similar accuracy between data collected using laboratory and wearable sensors.

We designed a between-subjects study where 48 participants took part in a memorization task and observed a confederate mistreating a robot both verbally and physically. The robot was either empathetic towards the participant's performance in the task or indifferent. When the robot was mistreated, it ignored the abuse, shut down in response to it, or reacted emotionally. We found that the majority of the participants intervened to help the robot after it was abused. Interventions happened for a wide range of reasons. Interestingly, the empathetic robot increased the proportion of participants that self-reported intervening in comparison to the indifferent robot, but more participants moved the robot as a response to abuse in the latter case. The participants also perceived the robot being verbally mistreated more and reported higher levels of personal distress when the robot briefly shut down after abuse in comparison to when it reacted emotionally or did not react at all.","2018","2021-05-19 13:31:02","2021-05-19 13:31:02","","169-177","","","","","","","ACM IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction","","","","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: Assoc Comp Machinery; IEEE; ACM SIGCHI; ACM SIGAI; IEEE Robot & Automat Soc; Kinova; Disney Res; LuxAI; Toyota Res Inst; Furhat Robot; Honda Res Inst; Google; Beam; Robotis; Savioke; Yujin Robot; Misty Robot; Hebi Robot; Haption; Otto Motors; AAAI ISSN: 2167-2121 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>13th Annual ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), Chicago, IL, MAR 05-08, 2018</p>","","","","robots; empathy; Human-robot interaction; abuse; bullying; peer intervention","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Furthermore, the growing interest in creating robots that are capable of collaborating with other humans in team settings provides an opportunity to explore another side of human emotion, namely, group-based emotions. This paper contributes with the first model on group-based emotions in social robotic partners. We defined a model of group-based emotions for social robots that allowed us to create two distinct robotic characters that express either individual or group-based emotions. This paper also contributes with a user study where two autonomous robots embedded the previous characters, and formed two human-robot teams to play a competitive game. Our results showed that participants perceived the robot that expresses group-based emotions as more likeable and attributed higher levels of group identification and group trust towards their teams, when compared to the robotic partner that expresses individual-based emotions.","2018","2021-05-19 13:31:03","2021-05-19 13:31:03","","261-269","","","","","","","ACM IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction","","","","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: Assoc Comp Machinery; IEEE; ACM SIGCHI; ACM SIGAI; IEEE Robot & Automat Soc; Kinova; Disney Res; LuxAI; Toyota Res Inst; Furhat Robot; Honda Res Inst; Google; Beam; Robotis; Savioke; Yujin Robot; Misty Robot; Hebi Robot; Haption; Otto Motors; AAAI ISSN: 2167-2121 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>13th Annual ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), Chicago, IL, MAR 05-08, 2018</p>","","","","emotion; trust; group effects; Human-robot teamwork; identification; inter-group interactions; self-categorisation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, we proposed a counseling agent (CA) called CRECA (context respectful counseling agent), which listens to clients and promotes their reflection context respectfully namely in a context preserving way. This agent is now enhanced using a body language called “unazuki” in Japanese, a kind of nodding to greatly promote dialogue, often accompanying “un-un” (meaning “exactly”) of Japanese onomatopoeia. This body language significantly helps represent empathy or entire approval. Our agent is enhanced with such dialog promotion nodding robot to continue the conversation naturally or context respectfully towards clients' further reflection. To realize it, the robot nods twice at each end of dialog sentence input by clients. Here, we introduce a robot that behaves human-like by an appropriate nodding behavior. The motivation for such a more human-like robot was the extension of application fields from IT workers' counselling to people, who suffer from more social problems such as financial debt, or anxiety of victory or defeat. For such applications, it is important that the agent behaves as much as possible human-like. Here, we present an enhanced experimental evaluation. The quantitative evaluation is based on the utterance amounts of a test group of individuals. These amount with and without the nodding feature are compared. Additionally, the robots with and without nodding are compared according several subjective feelings by the evaluation subjects.","2018","2021-05-19 13:31:04","2021-05-19 13:31:04","","1716-1722","","","","","","","IEEE International Conference on Systems Man and Cybernetics Conference Proceedings","","","","IEEE","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: IEEE; Sci Council Japan ISSN: 1062-922X Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC), IEEE Syst Man &amp; Cybernet Soc, Miyazaki, JAPAN, OCT 07-10, 2018</p>","","","","Robot; Counseling; Dialog Promotion; Nodding; unazuki","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Furthermore, a transformation model is proposed to convert the obtained emotional behaviors into a specific robot's motion space. To validate the proposed approach, the models were evaluated by two example scenarios of interaction. The experimental results confirmed that the proposed approach endows a social robot with the capability to learn emotional behaviors from individual users, and to generate its emotional bodily expressions.

Dick's empathy box from his novel Do Androids Dream of Electronic Sheep? [3]. In the novel, thousands of people were anonymously connected with each other both haptically and emotionally when they grabbed the handles of their empathy boxes. The Empathy Amulet similarly networks a group of strangers together through shared experiences of physical warmth. It is not yet another technology for staying in touch with people you already know (and falling short). Rather, it encourages its wearer to make a deliberate and generous choice to invest their time and energy in connection with strangers, and it incorporates reciprocity into its design, such that helping oneself means helping other people. In today's world, people are less likely to feel empathy towards those not in their immediate network of family and friends, and, despite a proliferation of connective technologies, loneliness is on the rise [2, 5]. Surprisingly, it is the perceived sense of loneliness, and not actually being physically alone that has numerous health consequences for a significant portion of the population. Lakoff and Johnson's theory of embodied mind asserts that our physical and subjective experiences are inextricably linked, and the Empathy Amulet leverages the powerful connection between the physical experience of warmth and the subjective experience of social connectedness to combat loneliness and cultivate a stronger sense of connection with strangers [1, 4].","2018","2021-05-19 13:31:08","2021-05-19 13:31:08","","248-253","","","","","","","","","","","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: Assoc Comp Machinery; ACM SIGCHI; ACM SIGMOBILE; NOKIA Bell Labs; Intel; Microsoft; NAVER Lab; HUAWEI; Singapore Tourism Board; SG Singapore Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>ACM International Symposium on Wearable Computers, Google, Singapore, SINGAPORE, OCT 08-12, 2018</p>","","","","Embodied cognition; haptic I/O; internet of things; prototyping; wearable electronics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DICK'S “DO ANDROIDS DREAM OF ELECTRIC SHEEP?”","NOVYI FILOLOGICHESKII VESTNIK-NEW PHILOLOGICAL BULLETIN","","2072-9316","","","Written in 1968, the sci-fi novel by the American author Philip K. Dick “Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?” still retains the interest of the wide reading audience. The paper aims at elaborating upon the reasons for this lasting public enthusiasm which is claimed to relate not only to extremely successful film-versions of the book, but, even more so, to the highly topical message of the novel. In his antiutopian text, Philip K. Dick manages to put into focus the whole range of issues curraently associated with posthumanism. These are environmental problems caused by human activities, interplanet colonization escalating the conflicts of inclusion / exclusion, human / animal relations overlapping with the hybridization of natural and artificial, critical problems of future technological posthumanism manifesting themselves in highly problematic distinction between the humans and androids and in questioning the ontoethical status of the humans Philip K. Dick explores philosophical and social underpinnings of the catastrophic future which lies in wait for humanity and seems to strongly adhere to such humanistic values as empathy (the main touchstone to differentiate between humans and androids), self-reflection (the predominant feature of the protagonist Rick Deckard), search for identity and for meaning as the principal vectors of the human life, mercy for the mentally handicapped. Philip K. Dick's book can be viewed as one of the earliest caveats of the emerging trend to reconsider humanness in the sociocultural context of rapidly developing technology, various environmental threats, all kinds of hybridization and their ethical repercussions - and as such can be seen as truly prognostic, the most valuable part of it to be found in its ethical and social awareness and highly conscious refusal to suggest any final answer: essentially, the titled question seems eristically unanswerable.","2018","2021-05-19 13:31:09","2021-05-19 13:31:09","","197-207","","47","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: MIUSSKAYA SQ 6, MOSCOW GSP-3, 125993, RUSSIA Publisher: RUSSIAN STATE UNIV HUMANITIES Type: Article","","","","","empathy; (post)humanism; anti-utopia; historicism; humanness; ideology; Philip K.

Educators recognise that effective and active approaches to teaching are more closely associated with deeper learning. These active approaches aim to develop higher order skills, encouraging learners' critical thinking and decision-making as well as enhancing their capacity to be agile, flexible and adaptable. Among those active approaches stand serious games, which are powerful learning environments that are seen as an emergent and engaging new way of experiment situations and construct knowledge. Serious games, in the form of role-play simulations, are scenario-based games that are used to simulate real life situations. Although serious games and simulations have been widely used in serving educational purposes, there is little evidence on their use in achieving deeper learning. In addition, there is lack of guidelines or a framework for designing serious games to support learners achieve deep learning. This paper proposes a theoretical framework, based on Bloom's educational model for Mastery Learning, which illustrates the design of instructional process adapted for serious games using empathy and creativity as an approach of designing serious games for achieving deeper learning. It describes an approach of evaluating this framework by designing a serious game focusing on raising awareness about domestic violence and abuse.","2018","2021-05-19 13:31:09","2021-05-19 13:31:09","","785-791","","","","","","","Proceedings of the European Conference on Games-Based Learning","","","","ACAD CONFERENCES LTD","CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND","English","","","","","","","ISSN: 2049-0992 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>12th European Conference on Games Based Learning (ECGBL), SKEMA Business Sch, FRANCE, OCT 04-05, 2018</p>","","","","empathy; creativity; deeper learning; formative assessment; role-play simulations; serious games","Ciussi, M","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, learners feel that these robots have monotonous behaviors, making collaborative learning with the robot a boring experience. To solve this problem, a previous study proposed using the sympathy-expression method in which the robot expresses its own emotions autonomously on the basis of the answer time. However, we propose the notion that the writing time should also be considered. The writing time is defined as the time taken by the learners to answer the questions. When learners wrote a lot, the answer time became long and the robot (in the previous method) used to express emotions of sleep. To empathize with the learners, it is important for the robot to express emotions of arousal. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the sympathy-expression method, which expresses emotions based on the writing time.","2018","2021-05-19 13:31:10","2021-05-19 13:31:10","","","","","","","","","IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems","","","","IEEE","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: IEEE ISSN: 1098-7584 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE), Rio de Janeiro, BRAZIL, JUL 08-13, 2018</p>","","","","background subtraction; educational-support robots; SD method; sympathy expression method","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In fact, not only is it becoming apparent that quantum processes may regularly take place in biological systems, but these processes may underlie the mechanisms of consciousness and propel our models of conceptualizing the human brain into the next era of scientific understanding. The phenomena of consciousness have allured scientists and philosophers for thousands of years, while a precise technical understanding has remained elusive. If possible, developing this understanding will likely be one of humanity's greatest achievements. Knowing the fundamental processes that create conscious experience has far-reaching implications, from the potential birth of true artificial intelligence to a better understanding of mental health disorder etiologies and treatments. One major challenge in the mental health professions, and, ultimately, in empathy of any kind, is being able to see from and appreciate another person's unique, subjective experience.

As a result, emotion recognition and adequate reaction are essential requirements for enhancing the quality of human robot interaction. This study proposes a computational model of emotion capable of clustering the perceived facial expression, and using cognitive reappraisal to switch its internal state so as to give a human-like reaction over the time. That is, the agent learns the person's facial expression by using Self Organizing Map, and gives it a meaning by mapping the perceived expression into its internal state diagram. As a result, the presented model implements empathy with the aim to enhance human-robot communication.","2018","2021-05-19 13:31:11","2021-05-19 13:31:11","","406-416","","","678","","","","Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing","","","","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: Liverpool John Moores Univ ISSN: 2194-5357 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>3rd International Symposium on Signal Processing and Intelligent Recognition Systems (SIRS), Manipal Univ, Manipal Inst Technol, Manipal, INDIA, SEP 13-16, 2017</p>","","","","","Thampi, SM and Krishnan, S and Corchado Rodriguez, JM and Das, S and Wozniak, M and Al-Jumeily, D","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, an enhanced model of robot emotional body expression is proposed which places emphasis on the individual user's cultural traits. Similar to our previous paper, this approach is inspired by social and emotional development of infants interacting with their parents who have a certain cultural background. Social referencing occurs when infants perceive their parents' facial expressions and vocal tones of emotional situations to form their own interpretation. On the other hand, this model replaces the batch learning self-organizing map with the dynamic cell structure, incrementally training a neural network model with a variety of emotional behaviors obtained from the users with whom the robot interacts. We demonstrate the validity of our incremental learning model through a public human action dataset, which will facilitate the acquisition of emotional body expression of socially assistive robots as a reflection of the individual user's culture.","2018","2021-05-19 13:31:13","2021-05-19 13:31:13","","377-382","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","English","","","","","","","Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>15th International Conference on Ubiquitous Robots (UR), Honolulu, HI, JUN 26-30, 2018</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

I turned this into an action research project that sought to answer the questions, What paradigm shift might we need to migrate from traditional rote learning to deep learning? What attitudinal change and philosophical beliefs would that call for in an instructor?' The search for a solution metamorphosed me from a disengaged instructor into an empathizing reflecting practitioner. It led my students to active engagement in an enquiry-based learning workshop, which significantly improved their performance. This paper celebrates the journey of our collective deep learning. It explicates how I built my personal theory of teaching praxis through critical consciousness and meta reflection. This knowledge-creation process is empowering and may draw many teacher researchers towards meta-reflexive engagement with the social systems around.

After a training phase, the robot acquires a sub-symbolic coding of the main concepts being expressed in tweets about the IAB Tier-1 categories. Then this knowledge is used to catch the new acquaintance interests, which let arouse in her a joyful sentiment. The analysis process is done alongside a general small talk, and once the process is finished, the robot can propose to talk about something that catches the attention of the user, hopefully letting arise in him a mix of feelings which involve surprise and joy, triggering, therefore, an engagement between the user and the social robot.","2018","2021-05-19 13:31:14","2021-05-19 13:31:14","","573-585","","","10870","","","","Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence","","","","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: Startup OLE; Govt Principado Asturias; Govt Local Council Oviedo; Univ Oviedo; Univ Oviedo, Comp Sci Dept; Univ Salamanca ISSN: 0302-9743 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>13th International Conference on Hybrid Artificial Intelligent Systems (HAIS), Oviedo, SPAIN, JUN 20-22, 2018</p>","","","","","Juez, FJD and Villar, JR and DeLaCal, EA and Herrero, A and Quintian, H and Saez, JA and Corchado, E","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, we could not provide feedback to cyberspace regarding the place, time, and target of a user realizing friendship since there is no technique for conveniently measuring the evocation of friendship during offline events. In this research, we propose a method of estimating the evocation of friendship using the similarity in the pulse rate variabilities (PRVs) of users when empathy is evoked between them. The user can be made aware of friendship estimated automatically through machine learning by wearing a wristwatch-type pulsimeter. CFs are more likely to evoke empathy than superficial friendships (SFs). To demonstrate the usefulness of this method, we conducted an experiment assuming an event where a group of four people are enjoying their time in an amusement park. From the experimental results, we showed that the similarity of the PRVs in CFs is greater than that in SFs when the favorability rating is high and the users like each other. Moreover, we showed that the proposed method estimated the evocation of friendship during the attraction experience with anf-measure of 0.74 at maximum and during an offline event with a mean f-measure of 0.78. The results showed the usefulness and effectiveness of this method.","2018","2021-05-19 13:31:15","2021-05-19 13:31:15","","1407-1426","","7","30","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 1-23-3-303 SENDAGI, TOKYO, 113-0022, JAPAN Publisher: MYU, SCIENTIFIC PUBLISHING DIVISION Type: Article","","","","","machine learning; friendship; favorability; similarity of pulse rate variability of users","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Un-fortunately, many people cannot live with animals because of allergies, infection risk, or risk of damage to rental housing. To address these problems, some research groups have investigated robot-based psychotherapy. However, the important healing elements for therapy robots were not identified. Therefore, we conducted an Internet survey to determine the design elements of such a robot that might engender a healing mood and the functions that should be implemented. We assumed that a healing mood could be induced based on the interactive functions and appearance. To verify this hypothesis, we developed and evaluated a new interactive therapy robot. Next, we conducted interviews with individuals who interacted with a prototype therapy robot. The interviews revealed that the appearance of the robot was critical to engendering feelings of healing, comfort, and empathy.

In this situation, robots will require sophisticated capabilities, such as the ability to recognize human pain in advance and generate counter-responses as follow up emphatic action. Hence, it is important for robots to acquire an appropriate pain concept that allows them to develop these capabilities. This paper conceptualizes empathy generation through the realization of synthetic pain classes integrated into a robot's self-awareness framework, and the implementation of fault detection on the robot body serves as a primary source of pain activation. Projection of human shoulder motion into the robot arm motion acts as a fusion process, which is used as a medium to gather information for analyses then to generate corresponding synthetic pain and emphatic responses. An experiment is designed to mirror a human peer's shoulder motion into an observer robot. The results demonstrate that the fusion takes place accurately whenever unified internal states are achieved, allowing accurate classification of synthetic pain categories and generation of empathy responses in a timely fashion. Future works will consider a pain activation mechanism development.","2018","2021-05-19 13:31:18","2021-05-19 13:31:18","","56-73","","1","5","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: PO BOX 2604, SPRINGFIELD, MO 65801-2604 USA Publisher: AMER INST MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES-AIMS Type: Article","","","","","assistive robots; cognitive; empathic reaction; joint position; shoulder motion; synthetic pain","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

After decades of research and development, we have seen progress from Eliza and Parry in the 1960s and 1970s, to task-completion systems as in the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) communicator program in the 2000s, to intelligent personal assistants such as Siri, in the 2010s, to today's social chatbots like XiaoIce. Social chatbots' appeal lies not only in their ability to respond to users' diverse requests, but also in being able to establish an emotional connection with users. The latter is done by satisfying users' need for communication, affection, as well as social belonging. To further the advancement and adoption of social chatbots, their design must focus on user engagement and take both intellectual quotient (IQ) and emotional quotient (EQ) into account. Users should want to engage with a social chatbot; as such, we define the success metric for social chatbots as conversation-turns per session (CPS). Using XiaoIce as an illustrative example, we discuss key technologies in building social chatbots from core chat to visual awareness to skills. We also show how XiaoIce can dynamically recognize emotion and engage the user throughout long conversations with appropriate interpersonal responses. As we become the first generation of humans ever living with artificial intelligenc (AI), we have a responsibility to design social chatbots to be both useful and empathetic, so they will become ubiquitous and help society as a whole.","2018-01","2021-05-19 13:31:19","2021-05-19 13:31:19","","10-26","","1","19","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: EDITORIAL BOARD, 20 YUGU RD, HANGZHOU, 310027, PEOPLES R CHINA Publisher: ZHEJIANG UNIV Type: Review","","","","","Artificial intelligence; Conversational system; Intelligent personal assistant; Social Chatbot; XiaoIce","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This principle has been shown to be effective in games between humans and between humans and computer agents. We compared the social and cognitive engagement of children when playing checkers game combined with a social strategy against a robot or against a computer. We found that by combining the social and game strategy the children (average age of 8.3 years) had more empathy and social engagement with the robot since the children did not want to necessarily win against it. This finding is promising for using social strategies for the creation of long-term relations between robots and children and making educational tasks more engaging. An additional outcome of the study was the significant difference in the perception of the children about the difficulty of the game - the game with the robot was seen as more challenging and the robot - as a smarter opponent. This finding might be due to the higher perceived or expected intelligence from the robot, or because of the higher complexity of seeing patterns in three-dimensional world.","2018","2021-05-19 13:31:19","2021-05-19 13:31:19","","81-98","","1, SI","30","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND Publisher: TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD Type: Article","","","","","combining social and game strategy; Economic game strategies for robots; engagement robot/computer; long-term relations with robots","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, a Microsoft Kinect is used to track the player's skeleton and represent it as an avatar in the virtual environment while the HTC Vive is used for head tracking and virtual reality visualization. Multiple avatar positioning modes are trialled and discussed via a small self-reflective study (with the authors as participants) to examine their ability to allow accurate stepping motions, maintain physical comfort, and encourage self-identification or empathy with the avatar. While this is just an initial study, it highlights promising opportunities for designing engaging step training games with this integrated interface but also highlights its limitations, especially in the context of an unsupervised exercise program of older people in independent living situations.","2018","2021-05-19 13:31:20","2021-05-19 13:31:20","","","","","","","","","IEEE International Conference on Serious Games and Applications for Health","","","","IEEE","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: IEEE ISSN: 2330-5649 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>IEEE 6th International Conference on Serious Games and Applications for Health (SeGAH), Vienna, AUSTRIA, MAY 16-18, 2018</p>","","","","","Vilaca, JL and Grechenig, T and Duque, D and Rodrigues, N and Dias, N","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These internal emotions act as motivation for learning to respond to the user in different situations, using the physical capabilities of the robot. This paper proposes a deep hybrid neural model for multi-modal affect recognition, analysis and behaviour modelling in social robots. The model uses growing self-organising network models to encode intrinsic affective states for the robot.

As people interact more often with voice and gesture controlled machines, they expect the machines to recognize different emotions, and understand other high level communication features such as humor, sarcasm and intention. In order to make such communication possible, the machines need an empathy module in them, which is a software system that can extract emotions from human speech and behavior and can decide the correct response of the robot. Although research on empathetic robots is still in the primary stage, current methods involve using signal processing techniques, sentiment analysis and machine learning algorithms to make robots that can `understand' human emotion. Other aspects of human-robot interaction include facial expression and gesture recognition, as well as robot movement to convey emotion and intent. We propose Zara the Supergirl as a prototype system of empathetic robots. It is a software-based virtual android, with an animated cartoon character to present itself on the screen. She will get `smarter' and more empathetic, by having machine learning algorithms, and gathering more data and learning from it. In this paper, we present our work so far in the areas of deep learning of emotion and sentiment recognition, as well as humor recognition.

Formative assessment (FA) has emerged to be one of the efficient tools in the development of the above-mentioned competences and thus a topical issue in today's education. A number of studies have produced positive results investigating the use of formative assessment on the development of learner metacognitive and affective skills, student responsibility, active self-regulated learning, viewing learning as a goal rather than an outcome (Anderson, M., 2016; Brookhart, 2009; Chappuis, J., 2016; Fisher & Frey, 2014; [13]). The present study intends to examine the application of formative assessment in language classes at a higher education institution whose mission is to educate citizens for our society through commitment to liberal arts and sciences education. It aims at investigating how the application of formative assessment assists in fostering deep learning, student-centered approach, collaborative and tension free environment, active learning in small groups, enhanced dynamic exchange of feedback between teachers and students as well as self-assessment and peer-assessment both in traditional classroom as well as in virtual learning environment. It also explores the impact of formative assessment upon student lifelong learning skill development. Methodologically, the study is based on an opinion survey, reflection and class observation performed with 181 university students and 21 language teachers. The study has revealed that formative assessment adds significant value to the learning and teaching of languages. It settles very well in the education process based on liberal arts and sciences grounded in the principles of collegiality, cooperative learning, connection-building among all members of the learning and teaching process including students and teachers. It has also shown that the broad possibilities for the successful exploitation of formative assessment in language education are still in need of further in-depth research.","2018","2021-05-19 13:31:22","2021-05-19 13:31:22","","10084-10091","","","","","","","EDULEARN Proceedings","","","","IATED-INT ASSOC TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION & DEVELOPMENT","LAURI VOLPI 6, VALENICA, BURJASSOT 46100, SPAIN","English","","","","","","","ISSN: 2340-1117 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>10th International Conference on Education and New Learning Technologies (EDULEARN), Palma, SPAIN, JUL 02-04, 2018</p>","","","","foreign language learning and teaching; Formative assessment; student-centered approach; tertiary education","Chova, LG and Martinez, AL and Torres, IC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of this study is to compare two models describing social-emotional behavior, one of which is based on a traditional machine learning algorithm, and the other on a cognitive architecture supporting social emotionality. It is hypothesized that the second model will be more efficient in eliciting user's empathy to a virtual cobot based on this model. Here the object of study is a virtual pet: a penguin. Two models controlling the pet were compared: a reinforcement learning model (a Q-learning algorithm) and the emotional cognitive architecture eBICA (Samsonovich, 2013). The second approach was based on a semantic map of pet's emotional states, that was constructed based on the human ranking. It is found that the eBICA model scores higher in participant's empathy compared to the model based on reinforcement learning. This article compares strengths and weaknesses of both methods. In conclusion, the findings indicate advantages of the approach based on eBICA compared to more traditional techniques. Results will have broad implications for building intelligent social agents.

This study performs an experiment in WOZ environment in which different subjects (n=17) interacting with the same robot while they believe that the robot is a different robot, up to three versions. Each robot scenario provides a different `humanoid' description, and out hypothesis is that the more human-like looks the robot, the more empathically can be the human responses. Results were obtained from questionnaires and multi-angle video recordings. Positive results reinforce the strength of our hypothesis, although we recommend a new and bigger and then more robust experiment.","2018-03","2021-05-19 13:31:23","2021-05-19 13:31:23","","44-59","","1","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 701 E CHOCOLATE AVE, STE 200, HERSHEY, PA 17033-1240 USA Publisher: IGI GLOBAL Type: Article","","","","","Emotions; Empathy; Robots; Human-Robot Interaction; Fake; HRI; WOZ","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The things that come into context are the logical next steps in an evolutionary development towards computers that are better able to show empathy in relation to people: even more human oriented, anticipative and ubiquitous.

The behavior that would induce human-like feelings after long exposures is difficult to determine, and it often depends on the cultural background of the observers. Therefore, in this study, we generate an acting performance system for the android, in which an android and a human interact in a stage play in the real world. We adopt the theatrical theory called Contemporary Colloquial Theatre Theory to give the android natural behaviors so that audiences can comfortably observe it even after long-minute exposure. A stage play is created and shown in various locations, and the audiences are requested to report their impressions of the stage and their cultural and psychological backgrounds in a self-evaluating questionnaire. Overall analysis indicates that the audience had positive feelings, in terms of attractiveness, towards the android on the stage even after 20 min of exposure. The singularly high acceptance of the android by Japanese audiences seems to be correlated with a high animism tendency, rather than to empathy. We also discuss how the stage play approach is limited and could be extended to contribute to realization of human-robot interaction in the real world.","2017-12","2021-05-19 13:31:24","2021-05-19 13:31:24","","","","4","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND Publisher: MDPI AG Type: Article","","","","","social robots; android theatre; contemporary colloquial theatre theory; robot theatre","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These claims are based on a moderated mediation model. They reported a three-way interaction between game condition, gender, and avatar identification when predicting masculine ideology in their original study. Masculine ideology was associated, in turn, with decreased empathy. However, there were no main experimental effects for video game condition on empathy. The current analysis considers the strength of the evidence for claims made in the original study on a sample of 153 adolescents (M (age) = 16.812, SD = 1.241; 44.2% male). We confirmed that there was little evidence for an overall effect of game condition on empathy toward girls or women. We tested the robustness of the original reported moderated mediation models against other, theoretically derived alternatives, and found that effects differed based on how variables were measured (using alternatives in their public data file) and the statistical model used. The experimental groups differed significantly and substantially in terms of age suggesting that there might have been issues with the procedures used to randomly assign participants to conditions. These results highlight the need for preregistration of experimental protocols in video game research and raise some concerns about how moderated mediation models are used to support causal inferences. These results call into question whether use of “sexist” video games is a causal factor in the development of reduced empathy toward girls and women among adolescents.","2017-12","2021-05-19 13:31:24","2021-05-19 13:31:24","","2446-2459","","12","46","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA Publisher: SPRINGER/PLENUM PUBLISHERS Type: Article","","","","","Empathy; Masculinity; Sexism; Video games; Violence","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this article, we examine the feasibility of creating companion robots that would seek to nurture a user's empathy toward other human beings. As more and more computing devices subtly and overtly influence human behavior, it is important to draw attention to whether it would be ethically appropriate for roboticists to pursue this type of design pathway. Our primary focus is on whether a companion robot could encourage humans to perform charitable acts; this design possibility illustrates the range of socially just actions that a robot could potentially elicit from a user and what the associated ethical concerns may be.","2017-11","2021-05-19 13:31:24","2021-05-19 13:31:24","","499-507","","4","32","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article","","","","","Empathy; Charity; Companion robots; Design ethics; Nudges; Robot ethics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, while considerable progress has been made in recent years in terms of their technological realization, the ability of robots to interact with humans in an intuitive and social way is still quite limited. An important challenge for social robotics is to determine how to design robots that can perceive the user's needs, feelings, and intentions, and adapt to users over a broad range of cognitive abilities. It is conceivable that if robots were able to adequately demonstrate these skills, humans would eventually accept them as social companions. We argue that the best way to achieve this is using a systematic experimental approach based on behavioral and physiological neuroscience methods such as motion/eye-tracking, electroencephalography, or functional near-infrared spectroscopy embedded in interactive human-robot paradigms. This approach requires understanding how humans interact with each other, how they perform tasks together and how they develop feelings of social connection over time, and using these insights to formulate design principles that make social robots attuned to the workings of the human brain. In this review, we put forward the argument that the likelihood of artificial agents being perceived as social companions can be increased by designing them in a way that they are perceived as intentional agents that activate areas in the human brain involved in social-cognitive processing. We first review literature related to social-cognitive processes and mechanisms involved in human-human interactions, and highlight the importance of perceiving others as intentional agents to activate these social brain areas. We then discuss how attribution of intentionality can positively affect human-robot interaction by (a) fostering feelings of social connection, empathy and prosociality, and by (b) enhancing performance on joint human-robot tasks. Lastly, we describe circumstances under which attribution of intentionality to robot agents might be disadvantageous, and discuss challenges associated with designing social robots that are inspired by neuroscientific principles.","2017-10-04","2021-05-19 13:31:25","2021-05-19 13:31:25","","","","","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND Publisher: FRONTIERS MEDIA SA Type: Review","","","","","social neuroscience; human-robot interaction; social robotics; mind perception; attribution of intentionality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The emotion is considered as a source in the 3D space (Arousal, Valence, and Stance). State transition and emotion intensity can be quantitatively analyzed in the continuous space. This cognition-emotion interactive model have been verified by the expression and behavior robot. Empathizing is the main distinguishing feature of our work, and it is realized by the emotional regulation which operated in a continuous 3D emotional space enabling a wide range of intermediate emotions.

Mind perception also modulates the attitudes we have toward others, and determines the degree of empathy, prosociality, and morality invested in social interactions. Seeing mind in others is not exclusive to human agents, but mind can also be ascribed to non-human agents like robots, as long as their appearance and/or behavior allows them to be perceived as intentional beings. Previous studies have shown that human appearance and reliable behavior induce mind perception to robot agents, and positively affect attitudes and performance in human-robot interaction. What has not been investigated so far is whether different triggers of mind perception have an independent or interactive effect on attitudes and performance in human-robot interaction. We examine this question by manipulating agent appearance (human vs. robot) and behavior (reliable vs. random) within the same paradigm and examine how congruent (human/reliable vs. robot/random) versus incongruent (human/random vs. robot/reliable) combinations of these triggers affect performance (i.e., gaze following) and attitudes (i.e., agent ratings) in human-robot interaction. The results show that both appearance and behavior affect human-robot interaction but that the two triggers seem to operate in isolation, with appearance more strongly impacting attitudes, and behavior more strongly affecting performance. The implications of these findings for human-robot interaction are discussed.","2017-08-23","2021-05-19 13:31:25","2021-05-19 13:31:25","","","","","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND Publisher: FRONTIERS MEDIA SA Type: Article","","","","","intentionality; social cognition; human-robot interaction; social robotics; mind perception","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the future, we may face a different but related problem: that we might create (or cause the creation of) beings that not only satisfy but exceed these criteria. The question becomes whether these are minimal criteria, or hierarchical, such that those who fulfill them to greater degree should be afforded greater consideration. This article questions the validity and necessity of drawing divisions among beings that satisfy the minimum requirements for personhood; considering how future beings-intelligent androids, synthezoids, even alternate-substrate sentiences-might fit alongside the “baseline” human. I ask whether these alternate beings ought to be considered different to us, and why this may or may not matter in terms of a notion of “human community.” The film Blade Runner, concerned in large part with humanity and its key synthezoid antagonist Roy Batty, forms a framing touchstone for my discussion. Batty is stronger, faster, more resilient, and more intelligent than Homo sapiens. His exploits, far beyond the capability of normal humans, are contrasted with his frailty and transient lifespan, his aesthetic appreciation of the sights he has seen, and his burgeoning empathy. Not for nothing does his creator within the mythos term him “more human than human.”","2017-07","2021-05-19 13:31:25","2021-05-19 13:31:25","","476-490","","3","26","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA Publisher: CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS Type: Article","","","","","artificial intelligence; enhancement; humanity; novel beings; personhood; posthuman","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, RAT using humanoid robots is still a novel practice for which the adhesion mechanisms, indications and benefits remain unclear. Also, little is known about how the robot's behavioral and affective style might promote engagement of persons with dementia (PwD) in RAT. The present study sought to investigate the use of a humanoid robot in a psychomotor therapy for PwD. We examined the robot's potential to engage participants in the intervention and its effect on their emotional state. A brief psychomotor therapy program involving the robot as the therapist's assistant was created. For this purpose, a corpus of social and physical behaviors for the robot and a “control software” for customizing the program and operating the robot were also designed. Particular attention was given to components of the RAT that could promote participant's engagement (robot's interaction style, personalization of contents). In the pilot assessment of the intervention nine PwD (7 women and 2 men, M age = 86 y/o) hospitalized in a geriatrics unit participated in four individual therapy sessions: one classic therapy (CT) session (patient-therapist) and three RAT sessions (patient-therapist-robot). Outcome criteria for the evaluation of the intervention included: participant's engagement, emotional state and well-being; satisfaction of the intervention, appreciation of the robot, and empathy-related behaviors in human-robot interaction (HRI). Results showed a high constructive engagement in both CT and RAT sessions. More positive emotional responses in participants were observed in RAT compared to CT. RAT sessions were better appreciated than CT sessions. The use of a social robot as a mediating tool appeared to promote the involvement of PwD in the therapeutic intervention increasing their immediate wellbeing and satisfaction.","2017-06-30","2021-05-19 13:31:26","2021-05-19 13:31:26","","","","","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND Publisher: FRONTIERS MEDIA SA Type: Article","","","","","engagement; social robots; control software; dementia; geriatrics; psychomotor therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Objective: The aim of this study was to find technological solutions that meet the needs of mothers during the year following childbirth. Methods: Two co-creation workshops were undertaken with parents and professionals. The aim of the first workshop was to create a list of all the criteria the proposed solution would have to address to meet the needs of mothers after childbirth. The aim of the second workshop was to create solutions in response to the criteria selected during the first workshop. Results: Parents and health professionals want solutions that include empathy (ie, to help fight against the feelings of abnormality and loneliness), that help mothers in daily life, that are personalized and adapted to different situations, that are educational, and that assures some continuity in their contact with health professionals. In practice, we found that parents and professionals think the solution should be accessible to everyone and available at all times. To address these criteria, technology experts proposed different solutions, such as a forum dedicated to the postpartum period that is supervised by professionals, a centralized website, a system of videoconferencing, an online exchange group, a “gift voucher” system, a virtual reality app, or a companion robot. Conclusions: The human component seems to be very important during the postnatal period. Nevertheless, technology could be a great ally in helping mothers during the postpartum period. Technology can help reliably inform parents and may also give them the right tools to find supportive people.

However, these computer-delivered interventions rely on mouse, keyboard, or touchscreen responses for interactions between the users and the computer-delivered intervention. The principles of motivational interviewing suggest that in-person interventions may be effective, in part, because they encourage individuals to think through and speak aloud their motivations for changing a health behavior, which current computer-delivered interventions do not allow. Objective: The objective of this study was to take the initial steps toward development of a voice-based computer-delivered intervention that can ask open-ended questions and respond appropriately to users' verbal responses, more closely mirroring a human-delivered motivational intervention. Methods: We developed (1) a voice-based computer-delivered intervention that was run by a human controller and that allowed participants to speak their responses to scripted prompts delivered by speech generation software and (2) a text-based computer-delivered intervention that relied on the mouse, keyboard, and computer screen for all interactions. We randomized 60 heavy drinking college students to interact with the voice-based computer-delivered intervention and 30 to interact with the text-based computer-delivered intervention and compared their ratings of the systems as well as their motivation to change drinking and their drinking behavior at 1-month follow-up. Results: Participants reported that the voice-based computer-delivered intervention engaged positively with them in the session and delivered content in a manner consistent with motivational interviewing principles. At 1-month follow-up, participants in the voice-based computer-delivered intervention condition reported significant decreases in quantity, frequency, and problems associated with drinking, and increased perceived importance of changing drinking behaviors. In comparison to the text-based computer-delivered intervention condition, those assigned to voice-based computer-delivered intervention reported significantly fewer alcohol-related problems at the 1-month follow-up (incident rate ratio 0.60, 95% CI 0.44-0.83, P=.002). The conditions did not differ significantly on perceived importance of changing drinking or on measures of drinking quantity and frequency of heavy drinking. Conclusions: Results indicate that it is feasible to construct a series of open-ended questions and a bank of responses and follow-up prompts that can be used in a future fully automated voice-based computer-delivered intervention that may mirror more closely human-delivered motivational interventions to reduce drinking. Such efforts will require using advanced speech recognition capabilities and machine-learning approaches to train a program to mirror the decisions made by human controllers in the voice-based computer-delivered intervention used in this study. In addition, future studies should examine enhancements that can increase the perceived warmth and empathy of voice-based computer-delivered intervention, possibly through greater personalization, improvements in the speech generation software, and embodying the computer-delivered intervention in a physical form.","2017-06","2021-05-19 13:31:27","2021-05-19 13:31:27","","","","2","4","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 130 QUEENS QUAY E, STE 1102, TORONTO, ON M5A 0P6, CANADA Publisher: JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC Type: Article","","","","","alcohol intervention; Computer-delivered intervention; heavy drinking; voice-based systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Still, explanations as to why slightly imperfect human-like characters can evoke feelings of eeriness remain the subject of controversy. Many experiments exploring the phenomenon have emphasized specific visual factors in connection to evolutionary psychological theories or an underlying categorization conflict. More recently, studies have also shifted away focus from the appearance of human-like entities, instead exploring their mental capabilities as basis for observers' discomfort. In order to advance this perspective, we introduced 92 participants to a virtual reality (VR) chat program and presented them with two digital characters engaged in an emotional and empathic dialogue. Using the same prerecorded 3D scene, we manipulated the perceived control type of the depicted characters (human controlled avatars vs. computer-controlled agents), as well as their alleged level of autonomy (scripted vs. self-directed actions). Statistical analyses revealed that participants experienced significantly stronger eeriness if they perceived the empathic characters to be autonomous artificial intelligences. As human likeness and attractiveness ratings did not result in significant group differences, we present our results as evidence for an “uncanny valley of mind” that relies on the attribution of emotions and social cognition to non-human entities. A possible relationship to the philosophy of anthropocentrism and its “threat to human distinctiveness” concept is discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The existence of an implicit mentalizing system has generated considerable debate however, centered on the ability of various experimental paradigms to demonstrate unambiguously such mentalizing. Evidence for implicit mentalizing has previously been provided by the `dot perspective task,' where participants are slower to verify the number of dots they can see when an avatar can see a different number of dots. However, recent evidence challenged a mentalizing interpretation of this effect by showing it was unaltered when the avatar was replaced with an inanimate arrow stimulus. Here we present an extension of the dot perspective task using an invisibility cloaking device to render the dots invisible on certain trials. This paradigm is capable of providing unambiguous evidence of automatic mentalizing, but no such evidence was found. Two further well-powered experiments used opaque and transparent goggles to manipulate visibility but found no evidence of automatic mentalizing, nor of individual differences in empathy or perspective-taking predicting performance, contradicting previous studies using the same design.

It should also try to establish a social empathic relation with the user. To this aim, it is crucial to endow the robot with the capability of recognizing the user's affective state and reason on it for triggering the most appropriate communicative behavior. In this paper we describe how such an affective reasoning has been implemented in the NAO robot for simulating empathic behaviors in the context of AAL. In particular, the robot is able to recognize the emotion of the user by analyzing communicative signals extracted from speech and facial expressions. The recognized emotion allows triggering the robot's affective state and, consequently, the most appropriate empathic behavior. The robot's empathic behaviors have been evaluated both by experts in communication and through a user study aimed at assessing the perception and interpretation of empathy by elderly users. Results are quite satisfactory and encourage us to further extend the social and affective capabilities of the robot.","2017-02","2021-05-19 13:31:27","2021-05-19 13:31:27","","5073-5094","","4","76","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article","","","","","Empathy; Affective computing; Social assistive robots","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

CRECA listens to clients and promotes their reflection context respectfully namely in a context preserving way. This agent can be enhanced using a body language called “unazuki” in Japanese, a kind of “nodding” to greatly promote dialogue, often accompanying “un-un” (meaning “exactly”) of Japanese onomatopoeia. This body language is expected to significantly help represent empathy or entire approval. In this paper, the agent is integrated with such a “unazuki” or “dialog promotion nodding” robot to continue the conversation naturally or context respectfully towards clients' further reflection. To realize such “unazuki”, the robot nods twice at each end of dialog sentence input by clients. Here, we introduce our newly developed robot that behaves human-like by an appropriate nodding behavior. The main motivation for developing a more human-like robot was the extension of application fields from IT workers' counselling to people, who suffers from more social problems such as financial debt, or anxiety of victory or defeat. For such applications, it is often very important that the agent behaves as much as possible human-like. Finally, we present the experimental evaluation results that proves such nodding is effective in counseling.","2017","2021-05-19 13:31:28","2021-05-19 13:31:28","","56-62","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: IEEE Comp Soc; Malaviya Natl Inst Technol; Univ Bourgogne; Univ Milan; Univ Bourgogne, Lab Electronique Image Informatique Res Grp; Natl Res Ctr Italy, Inst High Performance Comp & Networking; Govt Rajasthan, Dept Sci & Technol; IEEE Comp Soc, Special Interest Grp Semant Multimedia Management; ACM Special Interest Grp Appl Comp, French Chapter; IFIP; ACM Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>13th International Conference on Signal-Image Technology and Internet-Based Systems (SITIS), Jaipur, INDIA, DEC 04-07, 2017</p>","","","","Robot; Counseling; Dialog Promotion; Nodding; unazuki","Yetongnon, K and Dipanda, A and Chbeir, R and Gallo, L and Nain, N","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Google promotes a new form of “infrastructural intelligence,” which excels by constantly reassessing its cognitive architecture in exchange with a cloud of data that surrounds it, and exhibits putatively human capacities such as intuition. I argue that such (re)alignments of biological and artificial intelligence have been enabled by a paradigmatic infrastructuralization of the brain in contemporary neuroscience. This infrastructuralization is based in methodologies that epistemically liken the brain to complex systems of an entirely different scale (i.e., global logistics) and has given rise to diverse research efforts that target the neuronal infrastructures of higher cognitive functions such as empathy and creativity. What is at stake in this process is no less than the shape of brains to come and a revised understanding of the intelligent and creative social subject.","2017","2021-05-19 13:31:29","2021-05-19 13:31:29","","101-128","","","233","","","","Progress in Brain Research","","","","ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV","SARA BURGERHARTSTRAAT 25, PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","English","","","","","","","ISSN: 0079-6123 Type: Review; Book Chapter DOI: 10.1016/bs.pbr.2017.06.004","","","","","Artificial intelligence; Brain imaging; Computational neuroscience; Default mode network; Google DeepMind technologies","Mahfoud, T and McLean, S and Rose, N","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, compared to physical reality, sharing these experiences is difficult because the user's virtual environment is not easily observable from the outside and the user's face is partly occluded by the VR headset. Mixed Reality (MR) is a medium that alleviates some of this disconnect by sharing the virtual context of a VR user in a flat video format that can be consumed by an audience to get a feel for the user's experience. Even though MR allows audiences to connect actions of the VR user with their virtual environment, empathizing with them is difficult because their face is hidden by the headset. We present a solution to address this problem by virtually removing the headset and revealing the face underneath it using a combination of 3D vision, machine learning and graphics techniques. We have integrated our headset removal approach with Mixed Reality, and demonstrate results on several VR games and experiences.","2017","2021-05-19 13:31:29","2021-05-19 13:31:29","","","","","","","","","","","","","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: ACM Special Interst Grp Comp Graph & Interact Tech Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>ACM Special-Interest-Group-on-Computer-Graphics-and-Interactive-Techniques Conference (ACM SIGGRAPH Talks), Los Angeles, CA, JUL 30-AUG 08, 2017</p>","","","","virtual reality; Mixed reality; facial synthesis; headset removal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By approaching the field through creative writing practice, this paper argues that casting players as experience-rather than story-protagonists, has proved an effective alternate means of writing and designing for Playable Stories. Through close analysis of the growing Story Exploration Game genre and comparison with interactive theatre, four new terms-the dynamic syuzhet, authored fabula, fixed syuzhet and improvised fabula-are introduced to show how writing and designing for players as experience protagonists can negotiate the needs of narrative and player agency, provide means to combine mimetic and diegetic player experiences, pair self-directed and empathic engagement, and offer opportunities to use dramatic irony-a cornerstone of narrative drive in other storytelling forms that is unexploited in interactive storytelling.

As the breath of robots applications requiring human interaction grow, it is important for robots to acquire sophisticated social skills such as empathy towards pain. However, it turns out that this is difficult to achieve without having an appropriate concept of pain that relies on robots being aware of their own body machinery aspects. This paper introduces the concept of pain, based on the ability to develop a state of awareness of robots own body and the use of the fault detection approach to generate artificial robot pain. Faults provide the stimulus and defines a classified magnitude value, which constitutes artificial pain generation, comprised of synthetic pain classes. Our experiment evaluates some of synthetic pain classes and the results show that the robot gains awareness of its internal state through its ability to predict its joint motion and generate appropriate artificial pain. The robot is also capable of alerting humans whenever a task will generate artificial pain, or whenever humans fails to acknowledge the alert, the robot can take a considerable preventive actions through joint stiffness adjustment.","2017","2021-05-19 13:31:30","2021-05-19 13:31:30","","694-699","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: Inst Elect & Elect Engineers; Inst Elect & Elect Engineers Robot & Automat Soc; Harbin Inst Technol; Beijing Inst Technol; Univ Nevada; Univ Electro Commun Tokyo; Chinese Univ Hong Kong; Chinese Acad Sci Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>IEEE International Conference on Real-time Computing and Robotics (RCAR), Okinawa, JAPAN, JUL 14-18, 2017</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A model of empathy in engineering as a core skill, as a practice orientation and a professional way of being that can be taught in university programs has been proposed [1]. Does an emotional intelligence model of empathy need to be taught earlier than at the university level? The engineering design process has been included in the science standards for k-12 schools since 2013[2]. One of the purposes of this inclusion is the ability to reach a diverse population of students by applying real world problems in their curriculum. The design process typically includes the steps of defining the engineering problem, developing solutions and optimizing the design. Although the word “empathy” is not used, these problems are defined from an empathetic perspective as “situations people want to change” of “social and global significance.” However, the standards do not discuss how to define a problem or how to teach empathy. In the winter of 2016 a study was conducted to evaluate the influence of empathy based lessons on girls' interest in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). Some information is known about empathy in lessons. Girls may be more interested if lessons are altered to include an element of caring [3]. Other studies indicate children's empathy increases with type of media provided in lesson (computer versus robot) [4]. The study in this article was a qualitative case study of 50 children, grades 6, 7, and 8, boys and girls in an after-school 4-H Science Club. The lessons were conducted once per week. The lessons were previously conducted in an all-girls after-school STEM program with similar available inexpensive materials. Both schools had similar demographics. The students and coordinators(instructors) were observed, pre- and post-surveys were conducted, and interviews of both students and coordinators were audio and/or video-taped. Although responses varied by lesson, initial results indicate many students and coordinators did not understand the meaning of empathy situated in engineering design.","2017","2021-05-19 13:31:31","2021-05-19 13:31:31","","","","","","","","","Frontiers in Education Conference","","","","IEEE","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: IEEE; IEEE ASEE; IEEE Comp Soc; Indian ISSN: 0190-5848 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE), Indianapolis, IN, OCT 18-21, 2017</p>","","","","empathy; design process; after-school science club; engineering; middle school","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

If we are to progress towards human and machine interaction that is engaging the human user, the machine should be able to recognize the emotional state of the user. Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have proven to be efficient in emotion recognition problems. The good degree of performance achieved by these classifiers can be attributed to their ability to self-learn a down-sampled feature vector that retains spatial information through filter kernels in convolutional layers. Given the view that random initialization of weights can lead to convergence to non-optimal local minima, in this paper we explore the impact of training the initial weights in an unsupervised manner. We study the effect of pre-training a Deep CNN as a Stacked Convolutional Auto-Encoder (SCAE) in a greedy layer-wise unsupervised fashion for emotion recognition using facial expression images. When trained with randomly initialized weights, our CNN emotion recognition model achieves a performance rate of 91.16% on the Karolinska Directed Emotional Faces (KDEF) dataset. In contrast, when each layer of the model, including the hidden layer, is pre-trained as an Auto-Encoder, the performance increases to 92.52%. Pre-training our CNN as a SCAE also reduces training time marginally. The emotion recognition model developed in this work will form the basis of a real-time empathic robot system.","2017","2021-05-19 13:31:32","2021-05-19 13:31:32","","1586-1593","","","","","","","IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","","","","IEEE","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: Int Neurol Network Soc; IEEE Computat Intelligence Soc; Intel; BMI; Budapest Semester Cognit Sci ISSN: 2161-4393 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN), Anchorage, AK, MAY 14-19, 2017</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A transformer set-up forms the central element in transmitting and distributing power. There is heavy transmission loss if the power system is defective. The transformers should be protected from internal faults and magnetic inrush currents. The power demands for a biomedical research center or hospital are higher and need to be consistent for the working of all biomedical equipments used. This paper proposes transient detection techniques using Wavelet transform (WT). The advantage of WT is that, it can represent current and voltage signals. Empathy of transients is very fast and precise so this work tends to elaborate on a new wavelet method to classify the inrush currents from power system disturbances. The classification problems in Artificial Intelligence (AI) are solved using neural networks. The neural networks derive its inspiration from neurons present in human body. The performance of NN is assessed based on the design of the hidden layers and by evaluating the weights that connect the nodes. There are no modifications made to the design of the hidden layers as the weight calculated is more important than the hidden structure. An optimum solution can be obtained by calculating the weights of NN by decreasing the function cost or error. This work aims to propose a modified neural network. The neural networks are trained using Firefly Algorithm (FA). Since this protocol is a simple and an efficient metaheuristic optimization technique which draws inspiration from fireflies which tend to move towards brighter light.

In our previous studies, we have focused only on the robot's emotional state. However, the emotional state of the other party is also an important factor for smooth conversation in human society. Therefore, the robot partner has two emotional structures for human: empathy and robot emotion. First, human empathy uses a perceptual based emotion model to know the human's emotional state based on the sensory information. Next, we propose a recurrent simple spike response model to improve the robot's emotional model, and we apply “Hebbian-LMS” learning to modify the weights in the spiking neural network. The robot's emotional state is calculated by using the human's emotional information, internal and external information. The robot partner can use the emotional results to control the facial and gesture expression. The utterance style is also changed by the robot's emotional state. As a result, the robot partner can interact emotionally and naturally with human. First, we explain the related works and the development of the robot partner “iPhonoid-C”. Next, we define the architecture of the emotional model to realize emotional empathy towards human. Then, we discuss the algorithms and the methods for developing the emotional model. Finally, we show experimental results of the proposed method, and discuss the effectiveness of the proposed structure.","2017","2021-05-19 13:31:32","2021-05-19 13:31:32","","258-285","","4","30","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: UNIV MALAYA, FAC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECH, KUALA LUMPUR, 50603, MALAYSIA Publisher: UNIV MALAYA, FAC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECH Type: Article","","","","","Conversation System; Emotional Empathy Model; Hebbian-LMS Learning; Recurrent Spiking Neural Network; Robot Partner","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Correspondingly, drift measurements in science are used as a means of rating the intensity of a body-ownership illusion via which a participant in a controlled experiment perceives that an extracorporeal appendage, or virtual whole-body avatar is incorporated as part of one's own body schema. In this research article, I will examine an applied performance by BeAnotherLab utilising the anti-disciplinary collective's The Machine to Be Another as part of Good Chance's Encampment project - this telepresence system produces a VR body illusion intended to increase empathy and reduce proximity between an immersant's real body and that of a volunteer refugee counterpart. When scientifically-tested body illusions cross a paradigmatic boundary to be framed as immersive art, what are the ethical implications? Furthermore, are these kinds of virtual proprioceptive transactions across different kinds of social and political boundaries symptomatic of radical empathic acts, or a capitalistic desire for the acquisition of another's experiences by virtual means? This article examines illusory bodily inhabitation through a Levinasian critical lens to consider the ethics of deterritorializing the immersant's gaze and referring their sense of touch elsewhere to produce narrative immersion'.","2017","2021-05-19 13:31:33","2021-05-19 13:31:33","","30-37","","3","22","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND Publisher: TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

I perform close readings of videogame-texts Metal Gear Solid 3 and Mirror's Edge demonstrating how the former enacts a traditional kinaesthetic empathy in the same way as in dance or film and the latter complicates this observer/performer relation. My paper concludes that, though a player/reader may experience a kinaesthetic empathy that resembles the filmic mode of observer/performer kinaesthetic empathy, the videogame form engenders a deeper tool-based empathy, which is altogether different from traditional conceptions of kinaesthetic empathy.","2017","2021-05-19 13:31:33","2021-05-19 13:31:33","","206-223","","3","28","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND Publisher: ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD Type: Article","","","","","empathy; avatar; body; Kinaesthetic; videogames","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An important aspect of human behaviour is emotion, both the ability to express and comprehend. While humans have developed excellent skills in inferring the emotional states of their counterparts via implicit cues such as facial expression and body language, this level of understanding is often neglected in Human Robot Interactions; furthermore, humans are able to empathetically respond to the emotions of others to create amore harmonious and person relationship. This paper is a preliminary proposal of a novel approach for facial emotional detection and appropriate empathetic responses, in conjunction with long term emotion mapping and prediction; the proposed system will be implemented on a social mobile robot, thus allowing a further level of behavioural comprehension to achieve a more human like encounter. The technique will be based on Fuzzy Cognitive Maps, using FACS Action Units as inputs, a high level facial descriptor layer and output of six emotions.","2017","2021-05-19 13:31:35","2021-05-19 13:31:35","","277-285","","","513","","","","Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing","","","","SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN","HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: Springer ISSN: 2194-5357 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>16th UK Workshop on Computational Intelligence (UKCI), Lancaster Univ, Lancaster, ENGLAND, SEP 07-09, 2016</p>","","","","","Angelov, P and Gegov, A and Jayne, C and Shen, Q","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This new revolution brings new paradigms that is breaking the way men work, and, consequently, changes in their training will also be necessary due to differences in knowledge and skills needed to meet new job demands. A fundamental characteristic of this new mode of production is multidisciplinary teams with a high level of technical knowledge and the ability to face several aspects of the production system, from production line up to customer interaction and integration with business and corporative systems. Besides, due to the velocity of transformations, the new employees must be able to learn and change quickly. Furthermore, such workers must develop intrinsically human characteristics like empathy, personal relationship and technical skills that machines won't be able to do, since all other activities would be done by machines with artificial intelligence and advanced robotics. This paper proposes the use of pedagogical robotics in order to develop multidisciplinary ability and development of interpersonal relationships, creativity and critical thinking to the future employees.

The emphasis is shifting to personal expression and communal arts and crafts practices are being adapted to solidify social and cultural participation. Learning research shows us how inner motivation and multilevel objectives in comfortable learning environments induce stable and generalizable learning results. In addition, collaborative ways of working make data processing more open and turn learning into a shared effort. On the other hand, playful learning and dramatic methods offer productive ways of examining life situations in an active and empathetic way. When using concrete materials in functional activities, deep learning is stimulated by offering experiential forums for learning. As well, an intentionally good-humored atmosphere facilitates success. Community art projects offer a platform for participants to generate well-being through art and craft activities combining personal expression with dialogue between actors. A person's activity cycles proceed spontaneously without questions of right and wrong, and in a dialogic and inclusive manner. The storyline of this presentation is about building up communal workshops designed under the pedagogical guidelines to be described and using hands-on activities involving materials. Specific effort was put on playful ideas and easy-going pursuits.

The case study is used to illustrate the different steps of the design method: (A) Build cognitive empathy and define cognitive styles; (B) Define design requirements, articulate variables that will control performance, understand limitations and design physical product; (C) Design the machine learning algorithm, inputs, and outputs; and (D) Integration and refinement. This work-in-progress report highlights the intricacies of applying adaptive machine-learning behavior to physical products performance in the “real world” rather than to a website or device such as a smart phone.

For artificial agents without emotional intelligence might generate behavior that is misinterpreted, unexpected, and confusing to humans, violating human expectations and possibly causing emotional harm. Surprisingly, there is a dearth of investigations aimed at understanding the extent to which artificial agents need emotional intelligence for successful interactions. Here, we present the first study in the perception of emotional intelligence (EI) in robots vs. humans. The objective was to determine whether people viewed robots as more or less emotionally intelligent when exhibiting similar behaviors as humans, and to investigate which verbal and nonverbal communication methods were most crucial for human observational judgments. Study participants were shown a scene in which either a robot or a human behaved with either high or low empathy, and then they were asked to evaluate the agent's emotional intelligence and trustworthiness. The results showed that participants could consistently distinguish the high EI condition from the low EI condition regardless of the variations in which communication methods were observed, and that whether the agent was a robot or human had no effect on the perception. We also found that relative to low EI high EI conditions led to greater trust in the agent, which implies that we must design robots to be emotionally intelligent if we wish for users to trust them.","2017","2021-05-19 13:31:37","2021-05-19 13:31:37","","129-141","","","10498","","","","Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence","","","","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: KTH Royal Inst Technol ISSN: 0302-9743 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>17th International Conference on Intelligent Virtual Agents (IVA), Swedish Natl Museum Sci &amp; Technol, Stockholm, SWEDEN, AUG 27-30, 2017</p>","","","","emotional intelligence; Human-robot interaction; empathetic robot","Beskow, J and Peters, C and Castellano, G and OSullivan, C and Leite, I and Kopp, S","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Digital games show some unique properties that make them valuable for inducing social change. Some of the game elements that can be used to integrate values are as follows: Narration, which is one of the elements that is most obvious to players and is part of most of today's digital games, is a proper way of presenting human rights topics and can also include ideological messages. However, there are also other ways of creating empathy for certain groups as the example of Ayitii - The Cost of Life shows: If players feel responsible for the game characters, games can make players think about the topic presented. Being able to take meaningful decisions which influence the player's avatar, other non-playable characters, the narration or the game-world is a property of many recent games. Thus, ethical decisions are included in games and put players into the shoes of those who are oppressed or put in other situations where there is no easy way of deciding if something is right or wrong. Finally, the article also discusses if these serious games can affect players' real lives and change their way of thinking and attitudes. The serious game This War of Mine shows that some players think about their decisions and the topic of the game even after having stopped playing. However, there are also restrictions to transferring game contents into players' lives and induce social change. Quite often it is not enough just to play the game, teaching which must take place in a non-game context, is needed to make players aware of human rights (violations).","2017","2021-05-19 13:31:38","2021-05-19 13:31:38","","191-196","","","","","","","Proceedings of the European Conference on Games-Based Learning","","","","ACAD CONFERENCES LTD","CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: FH JOANNEUM Univ Appl Sci ISSN: 2049-0992 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>11th European Conference on Game-Based Learning (ECGBL), Graz, AUSTRIA, OCT 05-06, 2017</p>","","","","empathy; serious games; game elements; human rights; social change","Pivec, M and Grundler, J","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A video camera was used to capture an actor's performance. The actor's eyes and mouth were isolated, and footage was processed as movie textures to overlay a static 3D model of a head. Micro expressions (subtle, rapid movements of muscles in and around the eyes and mouth in particular) are thus captured in a fine-grained, yet low- cost and low-tech alternative to established techniques. A future experiment will compare the emotive efficacy of the hybrid virtual agent with that of a conventional (fully CG) rigged avatar head in a 6DoF scenario that transitions from sympathetic (gauging empathy by self-report) to confrontational (gauging physiological arousal by heart-rate or GSR). The experiment's prospective design is discussed, as well as its significance for the study of the crucial intersection of social plausibility and perceptual realism in VR.","2017","2021-05-19 13:31:40","2021-05-19 13:31:40","","","","","","","","","","","","","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: ACM SIGCHI; ACM SIGGRAPH Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>23rd ACM Conference on Virtual Reality Software and Technology (VRST), Chalmers Univ Technol, Gothenburg, SWEDEN, NOV 08-10, 2017</p>","","","","Virtual reality; social presence; avatar capture; social plausibility","Spencer, SN","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most of these sensors, implemented as matrix of pressure sensors, are rigid, cannot be fabricated in complex shapes, cannot be subjected to large deformations, and usually allow to capture only the contact event, without any information about the interaction context. This paper presents a tactile flux sensor able to capture the entire context of the interaction including gestures and patterns. The sensor is made of alternate layers of sensitive and insulating silicone: the soft nature of the sensor makes it adaptable to complex and deformable bodies. The main features from electrical signals are extracted with the principal component analysis, and a self-organising neural network is in charge for the classification and spatial identification of the events to acknowledge and measure the gesture. The results open to interesting applications, which span from toy manufacturing, to human-robot interaction, and even to sport and biomedical equipment and applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

An understanding of emotional interactions would be essential to such robots' behavior. To improve the cognitive and behavior systems of such robots, we propose the use of an artificial topological consciousness that uses a synthetic neurotransmitter and motivation, including a biologically inspired emotion system. A fundamental aspect of a companion robot is a cross communication system that enables natural interactions between humans and the robot. This paper focuses on three points in the development of our proposed framework: (1) the organization of the behavior including inside-state emotion regarding the phylogenetic consciousness-based architecture; (2) a method whereby the robot can have empathy toward its human user's expressions of emotion; and (3) a method that enables the robot to select a facial expression in response to the human user, providing instant human-like `emotion' and based on emotional intelligence (El) that uses a biologically inspired topological online method to express, for example, encouragement or being delighted. We also demonstrate the performance of the artificial consciousness based on the complexity level and a robot's social expressions that are designed to enhance the users affinity with the robot.

This research attempts to model specific forms of intelligence through brute-force search heuristics and also reproduce features of human perception and cognition, including emotions. Such goals have implications for artificial consciousness, with some arguing that it will be achievable once we overcome short-term engineering challenges. We believe, however, that phenomenal consciousness cannot be implemented in machines. This becomes clear when considering emotions and examining the dissociation between consciousness and attention in humans. While we may be able to program ethical behavior based on rules and machine learning, we will never be able to reproduce emotions or empathy by programming such control systems these will be merely simulations. Arguments in favor of this claim include considerations about evolution, the neuropsychological aspects of emotions, and the dissociation between attention and consciousness found in humans. Ultimately, we are far from achieving artificial consciousness. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Currently, there are many devices that allow gathering biometric measurements from human beings, such as EEG Headsets or Health Bracelets. The massive data sets generated by tracking of EEG and physiology may be used, among other things, to infer knowledge about human moods and emotions. Apart from direct biometric signal measurement, eye tracking systems are nowadays capable of determining the point of gaze of the users when interacting in ICT environments, which provides an added value research on many different areas, such as psychology or marketing. We present a process in which devices for eye tracking, biometric, and EEG signal measurements are synchronously used for studying both basic and complex emotions. We selected the least intrusive devices for different signal data collection given the study requirements and cost constraints, so users would behave in the most natural way possible. On the one hand, we have been able to determine basic emotions participants were experiencing by means of valence and arousal. On the other hand, a complex emotion such as empathy has also been detected. To validate the usefulness of this approach, a study involving forty-four people has been carried out, where they were exposed to a series of affective stimuli while their EEG activity, biometric signals, and eye position were synchronously recorded to detect self-regulation. The hypothesis of the work was that people who self-regulated would show significantly different results when analyzing their EEG data. Participants were divided into two groups depending on whether Electro Dermal Activity (EDA) data indicated they self-regulated or not. The comparison of the results obtained using different machine learning algorithms for emotion recognition shows that using EEG activity alone as a predictor for self-regulation does not allow properly determining whether a person in self-regulation its emotions while watching affective stimuli. However, adequately combining different data sources in a synchronous way to detect emotions makes it possible to overcome the limitations of single detection methods.","2016-08-19","2021-05-19 13:31:41","2021-05-19 13:31:41","","","","","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND Publisher: FRONTIERS MEDIA SA Type: Article","","","","","EEG; emotions; empathy; biometric information; eye tracking","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this article in order to analyze human behaviors in social context, we propose a new approach which explores interrelations between body part motions in scenarios with people doing a conversation. The novelty of this method is that we analyze body motion-based features in frequency domain to estimate different human social patterns: Interpersonal Behaviors (IBs) and a Social Role (SR). To analyze the dynamics and interrelations of people's body motions, a human movement descriptor is used to extract discriminative features, and a multi-layer Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) technique is proposed to model the existent dependencies. Laban Movement Analysis (LMA) is a well-known human movement descriptor, which provides efficient mid-level information of human body motions. The mid-level information is useful to extract the complex interdependencies. The DBN technique is tested in different scenarios to model the mentioned complex dependencies. The study is applied for obtaining four IBs (Interest, Indicator, Empathy and Emphasis) to estimate one SR (Leading). The obtained results give a good indication of the capabilities of the proposed approach for people interaction analysis with potential applications in human-robot interaction.","2016-08","2021-05-19 13:31:42","2021-05-19 13:31:42","","1679-1691","","8, SI","38","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA Publisher: IEEE COMPUTER SOC Type: Article","","","","","Bayesian approach; frequency domain; human movement analysis; social role; Social signal processing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Context : This teaching department in an isolated rural setting developed an interprofessional learning session to assist health students to understand issues of functional loss and social isolation that can affect elderly people. Innovation : The Premature Ageing Unisex Leisure (PAUL) Suit (c) was developed as part of a 1-day learning session for undergraduate health students - including students of medicine, nursing and allied health attending clinical placement in far-west New South Wales. The suit was developed locally and can be adjusted to simulate a wide range of functional losses in the wearer. Students undertake a range of daily tasks in the community while wearing the suit in the company of a student `carer'. Over the past 4 years, approximately 140 students have participated in the simulation. Post-simulation evaluations report that students gain a greater understanding of some functional issues associated with ageing, and of the social isolation that can be associated with these. The experiential nature of the activity leads to some powerful insights. Implications : This activity is an innovative, experiential tool to deepen students understanding of issues relating to ageing. The interprofessional nature of the activity is an important factor in the success of the day, and produces a wide range of shared insights. The activity also enhances the partnerships between the university, the health service and the local community.

There is an ongoing effort to find a HIP that is secure enough yet easy for humans. Recently, a new HIP has been designed aiming at higher security: the Civil Rights Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart (CAPTCHA). It employs the empathy capacity of humans to further strengthen Securimage, a well-known text CAPTCHA. In this paper, we analyze it from a security perspective, finding fundamental design flaws. Using several well-known machine learning (ML) algorithms, we analyze to what extent these flaws affect its security. We discover that thanks to them, we can create a successful side-channel attack. This attack is able to correctly solve the HIP on 20.7% of occasions, much more than enough to consider it broken. Thus, we show that there is no need to solve the problem of optical character recognition nor empathy analysis for computers to break this particular HIP. ML can be successfully used to break a HIP that uses both with a side-channel attack. This security analysis can be applied to other HIPs. It will allow to test whether they are leaking too much information by unexpected ways, given non-evident design flaws.

In this case, we aim to use an assistive technology in the shape of an affective avatar to help people who have been diagnosed with different forms of Social Communications Disorders (SCD). The designed avatar presents a humanoid face that displays emotions with a subtlety akin to that of real life human emotions, with those emotions changing according to the interactions that the user chooses to perform on the avatar.

The avatar has been evaluated by 48 people from different backgrounds and the results show the overall positive reception by the users, as well as the difference between neurotypical and non-neurotypical users in terms of emotion recognition and chosen interactions.

In this regard, many social robots based on reactive system have been developed to provide companionship for elderly adults with neurocognitive impairments such as dementia. However, these systems remain a problem such that no interactive dynamics of body gestures between human and robot has been considered. In this research, therefore, we developed a head motion synchronization system using mutual entrainment and implement it in a communication robot. This system was evaluated by conducting one-way face-to-face human-robot communication experiments with young native Japanese speakers under three conditions, namely unreactive, reactive and interactive conditions. Head motion synchrony analysis revealed a leader-follower relationship for the reactive model and a mutual entrainment of head motion for the interactive model. Also, questionnaire survey results showed the degree of empathy for interactive condition was significantly higher as compared with reactive and unreactive conditions. In addition, the degree of naturalness for interactive condition was significantly higher as compared with unreactive condition. Hence, these indicate that empathy was shared through mutual entrainment of head motion, which could provide a smooth interface in human-robot communication. This system would be extended to elderly adults as an assistive system for the elderly's rehabilitation.","2016","2021-05-19 13:31:48","2021-05-19 13:31:48","","1514-1519","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","English","","","","","","","Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>55th Annual Conference of the Society of Instrument and Control Engineers of Japan (SICE), Tsukuba, JAPAN, SEP 20-23, 2016</p>","","","","human-robot interaction; Head motion synchronization; mutual entrainment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

E-S theory explains the social difficulties in autism as the result of deficits or delays in empathizing, while explaining nonsocial behavior patterns as the effect of intact or even superior skills in systemizing. In this paper, the strength of systemizing is utilized to make up the deficiency and facilitate the development in empathizing via robot-assisted intervention, which has been identified as one of the most popular methods that are producing inspiring outcomes in the rehabilitation of children with autism. The design of HRI scenarios and tasks based on E-S theory makes the robot-assisted intervention more effective and efficient.","2016","2021-05-19 13:31:49","2021-05-19 13:31:49","","320-324","","","","","","","International Conference on Intelligent Human-Machine Systems and Cybernetics","","","","IEEE","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: IEEE; IEEE Comp Soc; Univ Bristol; Japan Adv Inst Sci & Technol; Beihang Univ ISSN: 2157-8982 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>8th International Conference on Intelligent Human-Machine Systems and Cybernetics (IHMSC), Zhejiang Univ, Hangzhou, PEOPLES R CHINA, SEP 11-12, 2016</p>","","","","social robot; autism therapy; Human Robot Interaction (HRI); Empathizing-Systemizing (E-S) theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Humor support is defined as the conversational strategies used in reaction to humor utterances. This paper aims at exploring the phenomenon of responses to humor interventions from the robot through the examination of a corpus. We assume that using humor in human-robot interaction sets up a positive atmosphere in which participants are willing to contribute. This study relies on 49 human-robot interaction dialogues and 381 adjacency pairs of humorous acts made by the robot and the following human responses. The human humor responses, elicited through canned jokes and conversational humor, were annotated. Three main categories of human responses were found (1) providing no support, (2) recognizing the attempt of humor and (3) contributing with more humor. The findings indicate that, as in human-human interaction, strategies of humor support are strongly dependent of the humorous event's context.","2016","2021-05-19 13:31:53","2021-05-19 13:31:53","","305-316","","","9749","","","","Lecture Notes in Computer Science","","","","SPRINGER INT PUBLISHING AG","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","English","","","","","","","ISSN: 0302-9743 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>4th International Conference on Distributed, Ambient and Pervasive Interactions (DAPI) held as part of 18th International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI International), Toronto, CANADA, JUL 17-22, 2016</p>","","","","","Streitz, N and Markopoulos, P","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One of the robots used in this study called MARC (See Fig. 1) was given a series of biased behaviours such as forgetting participant's names, denying its own faults for failures, unable to understand what a participant is saying, etc. Such fallible behaviours were compared to a non-biased baseline behaviour. In the current paper, we present a comparison of two case studies using these biases and a non-biased algorithm. It is hoped that such humanlike fallible characteristics can help in developing a more natural and believable companionship between Robots and Humans. The results of the current experiments show that the participants initially warmed to the robot with the biased behaviours.","2016","2021-05-19 13:31:53","2021-05-19 13:31:53","","148-158","","","9979","","","","Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence","","","","SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN","HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: SoftBank Robot; Univ Kansas, Sch Engn; Springer ISSN: 0302-9743 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>8th International Conference on Social Robotics (ICSR), Kansas City, MO, NOV 01-03, 2016</p>","","","","Human-robot interaction; Cognitive bias in robot; Human-robot long-term interactions; Imperfect robot","Agah, A and Cabibihan, JJ and Howard, AM and Salichs, MA and He, H","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Human-robot interaction in social contexts will be more effective if robots can understand human emotions and express (display) emotions accordingly as a means to communicate their own internal state. In this paper we present a novel computational model of robot emotion generation based on appraisal theory and guided by ethical judgement. There have been recent advances in developing emotion for robots. However, despite the extensive research on robot emotion, it is difficult to say if a particular robot is exhibiting appropriate emotions or even showing that it can empathize with humans by exhibiting similar emotions to humans in the same situation. A key question is - to what extent should a robot direct anger toward a young child or an elderly person for an act that it should show anger towards an ordinary adult to signal danger or stupidity? Realizing the need for an ethically guided approach to emotion expressions in social robots as they interact with people, we present a novel Ethical Emotion Generation System (EEGS) for the expression of the most acceptable emotions in social robots.","2016","2021-05-19 13:31:54","2021-05-19 13:31:54","","233-242","","","9979","","","","Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence","","","","SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN","HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: SoftBank Robot; Univ Kansas, Sch Engn; Springer ISSN: 0302-9743 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>8th International Conference on Social Robotics (ICSR), Kansas City, MO, NOV 01-03, 2016</p>","","","","Social robots; Appraisal theory; Ethical emotion; Appraisal compensation; EEGS","Agah, A and Cabibihan, JJ and Howard, AM and Salichs, MA and He, H","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The book and film create a novel and interesting framework to discuss the subject of replicas and replication within contemporary conservation practice. Key themes are decay promoting replication, original versus replica, creating empathy in replication.

We start from the hypothesis that the robots, in order to become personal companions need to know how to empathic interact with human beings. To validate our research, we have used the proposed system with the minimalistic humanoid robot Telenoid. We have conducted human-robot interactions test with elderly people with no prior interaction experience with robot. During the experiment, elderly persons engaged a stimulated conversation with the humanoid robot.

However, selection in a great number of medical schools worldwide is still based on knowledge exams, a procedure that might neglect students with needed personal characteristics for future medical practice. We investigated whether the personal profile of students selected through a knowledge-based exam differed from those not selected. Methods: Students applying for medical school (N = 311) completed questionnaires assessing motivations for becoming a doctor, learning approaches, personality traits, empathy, and coping styles. Selection was based on the results of MCQ tests. Principal component analysis was used to draw a profile of the students. Differences between selected and non-selected students were examined by Multivariate ANOVAs, and their impact on selection by logistic regression analysis. Results: Students demonstrating a profile of diligence with higher conscientiousness, deep learning approach, and task-focused coping were more frequently selected (p = 0.01). Other personal characteristics such as motivation, sociability, and empathy did not significantly differ, comparing selected and non-selected students.

Analyses focused on the relationship between empathy and two perspective-taking phenomena: Selection between competing perspectives (i.e., perspective-congruence effects) and prioritization of the Self avatar's perspective. Empathy was related to improved overall performance on this task and a reduced cost of selecting between conflicting perspectives (i.e., smaller perspective-congruence effects). This effect was asymmetric, with empathy (i.e., empathic concern) levels predicting reduced interference from a conflicting perspective, especially when adopting the Self (vs. Other) avatar's perspective. Taken together, these results highlight the importance of the self-other distinction and mental flexibility components of empathy.","2016","2021-05-19 13:31:58","2021-05-19 13:31:58","","170-181","","1-4, SI","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND Publisher: ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD Type: Article","","","","","Empathy; Personal relevance; Self-tagging; Visual perspective-taking","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An exploration of the acceptance and desire of teens to interact with avatars and virtual agents for self-management and behavioral modification was undertaken. Materials and Methods The utilized approach was inspired by community-based participatory research. Data was collected from 2 phases: Phase 1) focus groups with teens, provider interviews, parent interviews; and Phase 2) mid-range prototype assessment by teens and providers. Results Data from all stakeholder groups expressed great interest in avatars and virtual agents assisting self-management efforts. Adolescents felt the avatars and virtual agents could: 1) reinforce guidance and support, 2) fit within their lifestyle, and 3) help set future goals, particularly after witnessing the effect of their current behavior(s) on the projected physical appearance (external and internal organs) of avatars. Teens wanted 2 virtual characters: a virtual agent to act as a coach or teacher and an avatar (extension of themselves) to serve as a “buddy” for empathic support and guidance and as a surrogate for rewards. Preferred modalities for use include both mobile devices to accommodate access and desktop to accommodate preferences for maximum screen real estate to support virtualization of functions that are more contemplative and complex (e.g., goal setting). Adolescents expressed a desire for limited co-user access, which they could regulate. Data revealed certain barriers and facilitators that could affect adoption and use. Discussion The current study extends the support of teens, parents, and providers for adding avatars or virtual agents to traditional computer-based interactions. Data supports the desire for a personal relationship with a virtual character in support of previous studies. The study provides a foundation for further work in the area of avatar-driven motivational interviewing. Conclusions This study provides evidence supporting the use of avatars and virtual agents, designed using participatory approaches, to be included in the continuum of care. Increased probability of engagement and long-term retention of overweight, obese adolescent users and suggests expanding current chronic care models toward more comprehensive, socio-technical representations.","2016-01","2021-05-19 13:31:58","2021-05-19 13:31:58","","19-28","","1","23","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND Publisher: OXFORD UNIV PRESS Type: Article","","","","","avatars; participatory design; adolescent overweight and obesity; chronic disease self-management; computer-based health interventions; consumer health informatics; human centered design and evaluation methods; human-centered computing; virtual coaches; weight management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite several studies on when to backchannel, most of the current spoken dialogue systems generate the same pattern of backchannels, giving monotonous impressions to users. In this work, we investigate generation of a variety of backchannel forms according to the dialogue context. We first show the feasibility of choosing appropriate backchannel forms based on machine learning, and the synergy of using linguistic and prosodic features. For generation of backchannels, a framework based on a set of binary classifiers is adopted to effectively make a “not-to-generate” decision. The proposed model achieved better prediction accuracy than a baseline which always outputs the same backchannel form and another baseline which randomly generates backchannels. Finally, evaluations by human subjects demonstrate that the proposed method generates backchannels as naturally as human choices, giving impressions of understanding and empathy.","2016","2021-05-19 13:31:59","2021-05-19 13:31:59","","2890-2894","","","","","","","Interspeech","","","","ISCA-INT SPEECH COMMUNICATION ASSOC","C/O EMMANUELLE FOXONET, 4 RUE DES FAUVETTES, LIEU DIT LOUS TOURILS, BAIXAS, F-66390, FRANCE","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: apple; amazon alexa; Google; Microsoft; ebay; facebook; YAHOO JAPAN; Baidu Res; IBM Res; CIRRUS LOGIC; DATATANG; NUANCE; Speechocean Ltd; Yandex; Raytheon Technol ISSN: 2308-457X Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>17th Annual Conference of the International-Speech-Communication-Association (INTERSPEECH 2016), San Francisco, CA, SEP 08-12, 2016</p>","","","","spoken dialogue systems; attentive listening; backchannel","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such systems track and assess students' knowledge via inferential methods, such as the popular Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) algorithm. However, these methods do not typically draw on the affective signals that human teachers use to assess knowledge, such as indications of discomfort, engagement, or frustration. In this paper we present a novel extension to the BKT model that uses affective data, derived autonomously from video records of children playing an interactive story-telling game with a robot, to infer student knowledge of reading skills. We find that, compared to a control group of children who played the game with only a tablet, children who interacted with an embodied social robot generated stronger affective data signals of engagement and enjoyment during the interaction. We then show that incorporating this affective data into model training improves the quality of the learned knowledge inference models. These results suggest that physically embodied, affect-aware robot tutors can provide more effective and empathic educational experiences for children, and advance both algorithmic and human-centered motivations for further development of systems that tightly integrate affect understanding and complex models of inference with interactive, educational robots.","2016","2021-05-19 13:32:01","2021-05-19 13:32:01","","864-872","","","","","","","","","","","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: Int Fdn Autonomous Agents & Multiagent Syst; Natl Sci Fdn; Artificial Intelligence Journal; Springer; Unicen; Sumitomo Elect; Living Analyt Res Ctr; Panasonic R & D Ctr Singapore; Assoc Comp Machinery Special Interest Grp Artificial Intelligence; Assoc Comp Machinery Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>15th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS), Singapore, SINGAPORE, MAY 09-10, 2016</p>","","","","affective computing; child-robot interaction; socially assistive robots; educational robots","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In such scenarios, the main concern is enabling the robot to track the subjects' social and affective state modulating its behaviour on the basis of the engagement and the emotional state of its interlocutors. To reach this goal, the robot needs to gather visual and auditory data, but also to acquire physiological signals, which are fundamental for understating the interlocutors' psycho-physiological state. Following this purpose, several Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) frameworks have been proposed in the last years, although most of them have been based on the use of wearable sensors. However, wearable equipments are not the best technology for acquisition in crowded multi-party environments for obvious reasons (e.g., all the subjects should be prepared before the experiment by wearing the acquisition devices). Furthermore, wearable sensors, also if designed to be minimally intrusive, add an extra factor to the HRI scenarios, introducing a bias in the measurements due to psychological stress. In order to overcome this limitations, in this work, we present an unobtrusive method to acquire both visual and physiological signals from multiple subjects involved in HRI. The system is able to integrate acquired data and associate them with unique subjects' IDs. The implemented system has been tested with the FACE humanoid in order to assess integrated devices and algorithms technical features. Preliminary tests demonstrated that the developed system can be used for extending the FACE perception capabilities giving it a sort of sixth sense that will improve the robot empathic and behavioural capabilities.","2016","2021-05-19 13:32:02","2021-05-19 13:32:02","","58-70","","","9793","","","","Lecture Notes in Computer Science","","","","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: Convergence Sci Network Biomimet & Neurotechnol; Future Emerging Technologies, European Unions Framework 7 Program; Heriot Watt Univ ISSN: 0302-9743 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>5th International Conference on Biomimetic and Biohybrid Systems (Living Machines), Edinburgh, SCOTLAND, JUL 19-22, 2016</p>","","","","Affective computing; Human-Robot Interaction; Social robotics; Behaviour monitoring; Synthetic tutor","Lepora, NF and Mura, A and Mangan, M and Verschure, PFMJ and Desmulliez, M and Prescott, TJ","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although the most persuasive computer interfaces are often the most human-like, they have been predicted to incur the greatest risk of falling into the uncanny valley, the loss of empathy attributed to characters that appear eerily human. Previous studies compared interfaces on the left side of the uncanny valley, namely, those with low human likeness. To examine interfaces with higher human realism, a between-groups factorial experiment was conducted through the internet with 426 midwestern U.S. undergraduates. This experiment presented a hypothetical ethical dilemma followed by the advice of an authority figure. The authority was manipulated in three ways: depiction (digitally recorded or computer animated), motion quality (smooth or jerky), and advice (disclose or refrain from disclosing sensitive information). Of these, only the advice changed opinion about the ethical dilemma, even though the animated depiction was significantly eerier than the human depiction. These results indicate that compliance with an authority persists even when using an uncannily realistic computer-animated double.","2015","2021-05-19 13:32:04","2021-05-19 13:32:04","","1-23","","1","24","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA Publisher: MIT PRESS Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, we conducted an exploratory study to empirically examine children's perceptions toward the computer- and robot-mediated AR systems designed to make dramatic play activities interactive and participatory. A multi-disciplinary expert group consisting of early childhood education experts, preschool teachers, AR specialists, and robot engineers collaborated to develop a learning scenario and technological systems for dramatic play. The experiment was conducted in a kindergarten setting in Korea, with 81 children (aged 5-6 years old). The participants were placed either in the computer-mediated AR condition (n = 40) or the robot-mediated AR condition (n = 41). We administered an instrument to measure children's perceived levels of the following variables: (a) satisfaction (i.e., interest in dramatic play & user-friendliness), (b) sensory immersion (i.e., self-engagement, environment-engagement & interaction-engagement), and (c) media recognition (i.e., collaboration with media, media function & empathy with media). Data analysis indicates that children in the robot-mediated condition showed significantly higher perceptions than those in the computer-mediated condition regarding the following aspects: interest in dramatic play (satisfaction), interactive engagement (sensory immersion), and empathy with media (media recognition). Furthermore, it was found that the younger-aged children and girls, in particular, perceived AR-infused dramatic play more positively than the older-aged children and boys, respectively. The contribution of this study is to provide empirical evidence about the affordances of robots and AR-based learning systems for young children. This remains a relatively unexplored area of research in the field of learning technologies. Implications of the current study and future research directions are also discussed.","2015-06","2021-05-19 13:32:05","2021-05-19 13:32:05","","455-474","","3","63","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article","","","","","Augmented reality; Dramatic play; Educational robot","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Perception of virtual characters versus humans: an affective cognitive neuroscience perspective","FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY","","1664-1078","10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00576","","Recent developments in neuroimaging research support the increased use of naturalistic stimulus material such as film, avatars, or androids. These stimuli allow for a better understanding of how the brain processes information in complex situations while maintaining experimental control. While avatars and androids are well suited to study human cognition, they should not be equated to human stimuli. For example, the uncanny valley hypothesis theorizes that artificial agents with high human-likeness may evoke feelings of eeriness in the human observer. Here we review if, when, and how the perception of human-like avatars and androids differs from the perception of humans and consider how this influences their utilization as stimulus material in social and affective neuroimaging studies. First, we discuss how the appearance of virtual characters affects perception. When stimuli are morphed across categories from non-human to human, the most ambiguous stimuli, rather than the most human-like stimuli, show prolonged classification times and increased eeriness. Human-like to human stimuli show a positive linear relationship with familiarity. Secondly, we show that expressions of emotions in human-like avatars can be perceived similarly to human emotions, with corresponding behavioral, physiological and neuronal activations, with exception of physical dissimilarities. Subsequently, we consider if and when one perceives differences in action representation by artificial agents versus humans. Motor resonance and predictive coding models may account for empirical findings, such as an interference effect on action for observed human-like, natural moving characters. However, the expansion of these models to explain more complex behavior, such as empathy, still needs to be investigated in more detail. Finally, we broaden our outlook to social interaction, where virtual reality stimuli can be utilized to imitate complex social situations.","2015-05-12","2021-05-19 13:32:06","2021-05-19 13:32:06","","","","","6","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND Publisher: FRONTIERS MEDIA SA Type: Review","","","","","fMRI; virtual reality; social interaction; uncanny valley; action perception; emotion perception; naturalistic stimuli; virtual characters","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The challenge stems partly from the complexity and fluidity of this social process, but also from its covert nature. One powerful tool to enhance experimental control over such dynamic social interactions has been the use of avatars in virtual reality (VR); information about an individual in such an interaction can be collected through the analysis of his or her neurophysiological and behavioral responses. We have developed a unique platform, the Empathy-Enhancing Virtual Evolving Environment (EEVEE), which is built around three main components: (1) different avatars capable of expressing feelings and emotions at various levels based on the Facial Action Coding System (FACS); (2) systems for measuring the physiological responses of the observer (heart and respiration rate, skin conductance, gaze and eye movements, facial expression); and (3) a multimodal interface linking the avatar's behavior to the observer's neurophysiological response. In this article, we provide a detailed description of the components of this innovative platform and validation data from the first phases of development. Our data show that healthy adults can discriminate different negative emotions, including pain, expressed by avatars at varying intensities. We also provide evidence that masking part of an avatar's face (top or bottom half) does not prevent the detection of different levels of pain. This innovative and flexible platform provides a unique tool to study and even modulate empathy in a comprehensive and ecological manner in various populations, notably individuals suffering from neurological or psychiatric disorders.","2015-03-10","2021-05-19 13:32:07","2021-05-19 13:32:07","","","","","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND Publisher: FRONTIERS MEDIA SA Type: Article","","","","","emotions; pain; empathy; affective computing; virtual reality; avatar; FACS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

First, we address the detection of action units (AUs) of the facial action coding system using active shape models and Gabor filters. Normalized outputs of the AU recognition step are then used as inputs for a neural network that consists of an habituation network plus a competitive network. Both the competitive and the habituation layer use differential equations, thus taking into account the dynamic information of facial expressions through time. Experimental results carried out on live video sequences and on the Cohn-Kanade face database show that the proposed method provides high recognition hit rates. To assess the suitability of the developed emotional recognition system for human-computer interaction applications, it has been successfully integrated in the architecture of an avatar and we have conducted a preliminary experiment on empathy. The experiment showed promising results, as the avatar that made use of the emotional recognition system obtained a clear increase in the positivity of the rating when compared with the same avatar with no emotional response.","2015-03","2021-05-19 13:32:07","2021-05-19 13:32:07","","99-119","","2","27","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND Publisher: OXFORD UNIV PRESS Type: Article","","","","","agent-based interaction; computer vision; empirical studies in ubiquitous and mobile computing; gestural input; graphical user interfaces; intelligent avatars","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

On the one hand, we performed this study to assess the quality of the current facial expressions of two robot heads. On the other hand, we aimed at developing a simple, easy-to-use methodological variation to evaluate facial expressions of robotic heads. Short movie clips of two different robot heads showing a happy, sad, surprised, and neutral facial expression were compiled into an online survey, to examine how people interpret these expressions. Additionally, we added a control condition with a human face showing the same four emotions. The results showed that the facial expressions could be recognized well for both heads. Even the blender emotion surprised was recognized, although it resulted in positive and negative connotations. These results underline the importance of the situational context to correctly interpret emotional facial expressions. Besides the expected finding that the human is perceived significantly more anthropomorphic and animate than both robot heads, the more human-like designed robot head was rated significantly higher with respect to anthropomorphism than the robot head using animal-like features. In terms of the validation procedure, we could provide evidence for a feasible two-step procedure. By assessing the participants' dispositional empathy with a questionnaire it can be ensured that they are in general able to decode facial expressions into the corresponding emotion. In subsequence, robot facial expressions can be validated with a closed-question approach.","2015-02","2021-05-19 13:32:08","2021-05-19 13:32:08","","63-76","","1","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article","","","","","Human-robot interaction; Social robots; Facial expressions; Robot emotions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Its first dimension is auto-empathy and refers to an empathetic relationship with oneself: how can a human directing a robot expand the various components of empathy he feels for himself to this robot? The second is direct empathy: what does a human attribute to a robot in terms of thoughts, emotions, action potentials or even altruism, on the model of what he imagines and attributes to himself? The third dimension is reciprocal empathy that consists of thinking that a robot is able to identify with me, feel or guess my emotions and thoughts, anticipate my actions and wear me assistance if necessary. Finally, the fourth dimension, intersubjective empathy, is about thinking and imagining that a robot can inform me of things - emotions, thoughts that I am likely to experience- that I do not know about myself. Each of these four dimensions includes four different components: (1) Action (empathy of action), (2) Emotion (emotional empathy), (3) Cognition (cognitive empathy) and (4) Assistance (empathy of assistance). This theoretical model of empathy in four dimensions and four components defines sixteen items whose relevance will be tested in the near future through comparative experimental research involving human-human and human-robot interaction.","2015-02","2021-05-19 13:32:09","2021-05-19 13:32:09","","97-102","","1","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article","","","","","Psychology; Human-robot interaction; Auto-empathy; Direct empathy; Empathy with robots; Intersubjective empathy; Reciprocal empathy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

What exactly is empathy, and why do most humans have it? We present a model which suggests that empathy is an emergent behavior with four main elements: a mirror neuron system, somatosensory cortices, an insula, and infant-directed “baby talk” or motherese. To test our hypothesis, we implemented a robot called MEI (multimodal emotional intelligence) with these functions, and allowed it to interact with human caregivers using comfort and approval motherese, the first kinds of vocalizations heard by infants at 3 and 6 months of age. The robot synchronized in real-time to the humans through voice and movement dynamics, while training statistical models associated with its low level gut feeling (”flourishing” or “distress”, based on battery or temperature). Experiments show that the post-interaction robot associates novel happy voices with physical flourishing 90 % of the time, sad voices with distress 84 % of the time. Our results also show that a robot trained with infant-directed “attention bids” can recognize adult fear voices. Importantly, this is the first emotion system to recognize adult emotional voices after training only with motherese, suggesting that this specific parental behavior may help build emotional intelligence.","2015-02","2021-05-19 13:32:10","2021-05-19 13:32:10","","35-49","","1","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article","","","","","Developmental robotics; Emotional contagion based on SIRE model; MEI robot; Robot empathy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

On the other side, simulated robots are not able of personalized behaviors and behave according to the preprogrammed set of rules. We provide a tool to personalize affective artificial behaviors in cooperative human-robot scenarios, where human emotion recognition, appropriate robotic behavior selection and expression of robotic emotions play a key role. The preliminary experiments show that the personalized affective robotic behavior can achieve better results in a scenario in which a robot motivates children in learning.

The proposed model encompasses three main stages i.e., perception, empathic appraisal and empathic expression. Perception refers to capturing user's emotion state via facial expression recognition. Empathic appraisal is based on the computational emotional model for generating its internal emotions, mood state and empathic responses. The internal emotions are defined using psychological studies and generated on 2D (pleasure-arousal) scaling model; whereas, fuzzy logic is used to calculate the intensity of the each emotion.

Our results show that people with a certain type of high trait empathy (empathic concern) hesitate to strike the robots.

This is a common scenario in modern computer games, where players interact with NPCs assuming the guise of human characters. To explore this question, an online game was developed in which a human player had a primary objective of surviving against increasingly difficult waves of enemies. As a secondary objective, the player was tasked with protecting an unarmed NPC companion which assumed either a human, or non-human identity, but with identical underlying Artificial Intelligence. The intention was to explore whether the human player would be more or less protective of a synthetic companion simply due to the identity assumed. The results of the study demonstrate that player's behavior does change based on identity, and clearly indicates that the player was more protective of the companion assuming a human identity. Furthermore, the results show that this phenomenon extends beyond simple human and non-human identities, and that the specific persona, or gender of the NPC may influence the player's empathy towards it.","2015","2021-05-19 13:32:15","2021-05-19 13:32:15","","145-152","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: Soc Art & Sci; Uppsala Univ; Dept Game design Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>International Conference on Cyberworlds (CW), Visby, SWEDEN, OCT 07-09, 2015</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite the production of different computational models, their integration with cognitive and psychological theories remains a central problem. Reasons are both methodological and theoretical. Primarily, it is difficult to quantify the impact of such factors as individual differences, inclinations and personality traits. In addition, Agent-Based Models (ABMs) often use linear dynamics, even in describing emotions, without considering the basis of psychophysics. Bearing in mind this and focusing on compassion as a particular emotion, the paper aims to present a “Decalogue” for those interested in designing agents capable of mimicking human emotional behaviors.

The robot's function is to increase people's awareness to the effect of their behavior towards others, potentially leading to behavior change. Specifically, Kip1 is designed to promote non-aggressive conversation between people. It monitors the conversation's nonverbal aspects and maintains an emotional model of its reaction to the conversation. If the conversation seems calm, Kip1 responds by a gesture designed to communicate curious interest. If the conversation seems aggressive, Kip1 responds by a gesture designed to communicate fear. We describe the design process of Kip1, guided by the principles of peripheral and evocative. We detail its hardware and software systems, and a study evaluating the effects of the robot's autonomous behavior on couples' conversations. We find support for our design goals. A conversation companion reacting to the conversation led to more gaze attention, but not more verbal distraction, compared to a robot that moves but does not react to the conversation. This suggests that robotic devices could be designed as companions to human-human interaction without compromising the natural communication flow between people. Participants also rated the reacting robot as having significantly more social human character traits and as being significantly more similar to them. This points to the robot's potential to elicit people's empathy.","2015","2021-05-19 13:32:18","2021-05-19 13:32:18","","3-10","","","","","","","ACM IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction","","","","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: IEEE; ACM; ACM SIGCHI; ACM SIGART; IEEE Robot & Automat Soc; AAAI; HFES; ACM SIGAI ISSN: 2167-2121 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>10th Annual ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), Portland, OR, MAR 02-05, 2015</p>","","","","Empathy; Human-robot interaction; Ambient kinetic tangibles; Behavior change; Design; Robotic companions; Smartphone robots","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The system relies on the learning by teaching paradigm to build an interaction, so as to stimulate meta-cognition, empathy and increased self-esteem in the child user. We hypothesise that use of a humanoid robot in such a system could not just engage an unmotivated student, but could also present the opportunity for children to experience physically-induced bene fits encountered during human-led handwriting interventions, such as motor mimicry. By leveraging simulated handwriting on a synchronised tablet display, anao humanoid robot with limited fine motor capabilities has been con figured as a suitably embodied handwriting partner. Statistical shape models derived from principal component analysis of a dataset of adult-written letter trajectories allow the robot to draw purposefully deformed letters. By incorporating feedback from user demonstrations, the system is then able to learn the optimal parameters for the appropriate shape models. Preliminary in situ studies have been conducted with primary school classes to obtain insight into children's use of the novel system. Children aged 6-8 successfully engaged with the robot and improved its writing to a level which they were satisfied with. The validation of the interaction represents a significant step towards an innovative use for robotics which addresses a widespread and socially meaningful challenge in education.","2015","2021-05-19 13:32:19","2021-05-19 13:32:19","","83-90","","","","","","","ACM IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction","","","","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: IEEE; ACM; ACM SIGCHI; ACM SIGART; IEEE Robot & Automat Soc; AAAI; HFES; ACM SIGAI ISSN: 2167-2121 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>10th Annual ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), Portland, OR, MAR 02-05, 2015</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Once that interaction happens, users can be left with a hand full of satisfaction, dissatisfaction, or even a mix of both. To study the possible role of experience as a mediator between expectation and satisfaction, we developed a scale for HRI that measures expectations and satisfaction of the users. Afterwards, we conducted a study with end-users interacting with a social robot. The robot is being developed to be an empathic robotic tutor to be used in real schools, with input from primary end-users (children). Children's expectations and subsequent satisfaction after the interaction with the robotic tutor were analysed. The results can be fed back to the system developers on how well it is being designed for such a target population, and what factors regarding their expectation and satisfaction have shifted after the experience of interaction. By delivering on the children's expectations, we aim to design a robotic tutor that provides enough satisfaction to sustain an enjoyable and natural interaction in the real educational environment.","2015","2021-05-19 13:32:20","2021-05-19 13:32:20","","21-30","","","9388","","","","Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence","","","","SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN","HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY","English","","","","","","","ISSN: 0302-9743 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>7th International Conference on Social Robotics (ICSR), Paris, FRANCE, OCT 26-30, 2015</p>","","","","Human-Robot Interaction; Expectation; Satisfaction; Robotic tutor; User-centered design","Tapus, A and Andre, E and Martin, JC and Ferland, F and Ammi, M","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A group of participants is used to evaluate how imitation by a robot affects people's perception of their conversation with it. A set of twelve questions about the participants' university experience serves as a backbone for the dialogue structure. In our experimental evaluation, the robot reacts in one of three ways to the human upper body pose: ignoring it, displaying its own upper body pose, and mirroring it. The manner in which the robot behaviour influences human appraisal is analysed using the standard Godspeed questionnaire. Our results show that robot body mirroring/non-mirroring influences the perceived humanness of the robot. The results also indicate that body pose mirroring is an important factor in facilitating rapport and empathy in human social interactions with robots.","2015","2021-05-19 13:32:21","2021-05-19 13:32:21","","214-223","","","9388","","","","Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence","","","","SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN","HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY","English","","","","","","","ISSN: 0302-9743 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>7th International Conference on Social Robotics (ICSR), Paris, FRANCE, OCT 26-30, 2015</p>","","","","Empathy; Anthropomorphism; Body-pose mirroring; Rapport","Tapus, A and Andre, E and Martin, JC and Ferland, F and Ammi, M","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our approach to uphold PD patient dignity is through the use of an ethical robot that mediates patient shame when it recognizes norm violations in the patient-caregiver interaction. This paper presents the basis for a computational model tasked with computing patient shame and the empathetic response of a caregiver during “empathetic opportunities” in their interaction. A PD patient is liable to suffer indignity when there is a substantial difference between his experienced shame and the empathy shown by the caregiver. When this difference falls outside of acceptable set bounds (norms), the robotic agent will act using subtle, nonverbal cues to guide the relationship back within these bounds, preserving patient dignity.","2015","2021-05-19 13:32:24","2021-05-19 13:32:24","","532-542","","","9388","","","","Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence","","","","SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN","HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY","English","","","","","","","ISSN: 0302-9743 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>7th International Conference on Social Robotics (ICSR), Paris, FRANCE, OCT 26-30, 2015</p>","","","","","Tapus, A and Andre, E and Martin, JC and Ferland, F and Ammi, M","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our work aims at recovering the lost contact with animals in the urban context, taking advantage of biophilic empathy. The parameters governing the robotised elements we propose are mainly qualitative (emotions and aesthetical perception), which cannot easily be described by mathematical parameters. Additionally, due to their complexity, it is often impossible - or at least impractical, to hardcode suitable controllers for such structures. Thus, we propose the use of Artificial Intelligence learning techniques, concretely Evolutionary Algorithms, to allow the user to teach the robotised components how to behave in response to their resemblance to specific animal behaviors. This idea is tested on an intelligent fa, cade that learns optimal configurations according to the perception of aggressiveness and calmness.","2015","2021-05-19 13:32:25","2021-05-19 13:32:25","","465-472","","","9222","","","","Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence","","","","SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN","HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: Convergence Sci Network Biomimet & Neurotechnol; Univ Sheffield; Univ Pompeu Fabra Barcelona; Inst Catalana Recerca Estudis Avancats ISSN: 0302-9743 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>4th International Conference on Biomimetic and Biohybrid Systems (Living Machines), Barcelona, SPAIN, JUL 28-31, 2015</p>","","","","Biomimicry; Biophilia; Evolutionary robotics; Intelligent buildings; Wellbeing; Embodied evolution","Wilson, SP and Verschure, PFMJ and Mura, A and Prescott, TJ","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A psychophysiological investigation","FRONTIERS IN BIOENGINEERING AND BIOTECHNOLOGY","","2296-4185","10.3389/fbioe.2015.00064","","Non-verbal signals expressed through body language play a crucial role in multi-modal human communication during social relations. Indeed, in all cultures, facial expressions are the most universal and direct signs to express innate emotional cues. A human face conveys important information in social interactions and helps us to better understand our social partners and establish empathic links. Latest researches show that humanoid and social robots are becoming increasingly similar to humans, both esthetically and expressively. However, their visual expressiveness is a crucial issue that must be improved to make these robots more realistic and intuitively perceivable by humans as not different from them. This study concerns the capability of a humanoid robot to exhibit emotions through facial expressions. More specifically, emotional signs performed by a humanoid robot have been compared with corresponding human facial expressions in terms of recognition rate and response time. The set of stimuli included standardized human expressions taken from an Ekman-based database and the same facial expressions performed by the robot. Furthermore, participants' psychophysiological responses have been explored to investigate whether there could be differences induced by interpreting robot or human emotional stimuli. Preliminary results show a trend to better recognize expressions performed by the robot than 2D photos or 3D models. Moreover, no significant differences in the subjects' psychophysiological state have been found during the discrimination of facial expressions performed by the robot in comparison with the same task performed with 2D photos and 3D models.","2015","2021-05-19 13:32:28","2021-05-19 13:32:28","","","","","3","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND Publisher: FRONTIERS MEDIA SA Type: Article","","","","","affective computing; social robots; facial expressions; humanoid robot; emotion perception; expression recognition; psychophysiological signals","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, it is important to consider how interaction with a simulated robot differs from a real robot; that is, do simulated robots provide authentic interaction? We contribute to a growing body of work that explores this question and maps out simulated-versus-real differences, by explicitly investigating empathy: how people empathize with a physical or simulated robot when something bad happens to it. Our results suggest that people may empathize more with a physical robot than a simulated one, a finding that has important implications on the generalizability and applicability of simulated HRI work. Empathy is particularly relevant to social HRI and is integral to, for example, companion and care robots. Our contribution additionally includes an original and reproducible HRI experimental design to induce empathy toward robots in laboratory settings, and an experimentally validated empathy-measuring instrument from psychology for use with HRI.","2015","2021-05-19 13:32:28","2021-05-19 13:32:28","","125-132","","","","","","","ACM IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction","","","","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: IEEE; ACM; ACM SIGCHI; ACM SIGART; IEEE Robot & Automat Soc; AAAI; HFES; ACM SIGAI ISSN: 2167-2121 Type: Proceedings Paper","<p>10th Annual ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), Portland, OR, MAR 02-05, 2015</p>","","","","empathy; Human-robot interaction; robot embodiment; simulated interaction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
