A repository for the data and code from the review paper "How to Create Empathic AI".

## Guide
The code in the "Article processing" folder concerns article processing, while the code in the "Visualization" folder concerns visualization of the data in general. The "Articles" folder contains all data on articles (mainly archival) while the "Data" folder contains meta-data (e.g. for visualization, article encodings, etc.).

## Goals
See the issues for specific milestones in the project.

## Current stage
We are currently on the final stretch to work out which articles to include and which to exclude for the codings.
