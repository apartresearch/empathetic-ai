Many diseases such as type II diabetes will no longer be considered as a single disease. Many familiar cancers such as cancer of liver or pancreas will have hundreds of subtypes whose management will be very different. The way we think about diseases will change. It will no longer be possible for clinicians to make a diagnosis, remember the names of diseases, the names of drugs or management protocols without the help of computers. As computer intelligence becomes more important than human intelligence in deciding diagnosis and treatment there will be a paradigm in the role of doctors. Internet, computers and social media will become more important than individuals in decision making. As a result, medicine will go more and more egalitarian (""wiki"") with increasing community participation in health decision making and management. A socialistic pattern will evolve over time globally as an adaptive reaction to the pressures put by artificial intelligence. This is because the individual differences in knowledge or intellect between human beings will become less apparent compared to the super powers of artificial intelligence. Qualities which are unique for humans such as compassion, empathy and emotional care will decide the professional success of future physicians even more than today. Today we are using artificial intelligence in diagnosis and prediction to help clinicians. Clinical algorithms and human experience cannot be replaced by machines. It will take many years to completely merge or replace humans with machines. However, we need to modify our medical education system in order to prepare the medical community and sensitize the society well in advance for a smooth transition.","2019","2021-05-19 13:02:02","2021-05-19 13:02:02","","71-73","","4","67","","","Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8178727167","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There is an ongoing effort to find a HIP that is secure enough yet easy for humans. Recently, a new HIP has been designed aiming at higher security: the Civil Rights Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart (CAPTCHA). It employs the empathy capacity of humans to further strengthen Securimage, a well-known text CAPTCHA. In this paper, we analyze it from a security perspective, finding fundamental design flaws. Using several well-known machine learning (ML) algorithms, we analyze to what extent these flaws affect its security. We discover that thanks to them, we can create a successful side-channel attack. This attack is able to correctly solve the HIP on 20.7<i>%</i> of occasions, much more than enough to consider it broken. Thus, we show that there is no need to solve the problem of optical character recognition nor empathy analysis for computers to break this particular HIP. ML can be successfully used to break a HIP that uses both with a side-channel attack. This security analysis can be applied to other HIPs. It will allow to test whether they are <i>leaking</i> too much information by unexpected ways, given non-evident design flaws.

Some researchers have argued that AI will augment the capacities of physicians and increase their availability to provide empathy and other uniquely human forms of care to their patients. The human vulnerabilities experienced in the healthcare context raise the stakes of new technologies such as AI, and the human dimensions of AI in healthcare have particular significance for research in the humanities. This article explains four key areas of concern relating to AI and the role that medical/health humanities research can play in addressing them: definition and regulation of ""medical"" versus ""health"" data and apps; social determinants of health; narrative medicine; and technological mediation of care. Issues include data privacy and trust, flawed datasets and algorithmic bias, racial discrimination, and the rhetoric of humanism and disability.

The gulf between the curricular objectives and our teaching-learning methods intrigued me. I turned this into an action research project that sought to answer the questions, 'What paradigm shift might we need to migrate from traditional rote learning to deep learning? What attitudinal change and philosophical beliefs would that call for in an instructor?' The search for a solution metamorphosed me from a disengaged instructor into an empathizing reflecting practitioner. It led my students to active engagement in an enquiry-based learning workshop, which significantly improved their performance. This paper celebrates the journey of our collective deep learning. It explicates how I built my personal theory of teaching praxis through critical consciousness and meta reflection. This knowledge-creation process is empowering and may draw many teacher researchers towards meta-reflexive engagement with the social systems around. These change drivers can initiate institutional overhaul to effect systemic reforms.","2018","2021-05-19 13:02:02","2021-05-19 13:02:02","","603-625","","4","26","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","Publisher: Routledge.

In social neuroscience, many experiments have sought to first define and then locate ‘perspective taking’, ‘empathy’, and other psychological concepts to specific brain circuits. Seldom, bottom-up studies were conducted to first identify explanatory patterns of brain variation, which are then related to psychological concepts; perhaps due to a lack of large population datasets. In this spirit, we performed a systematic de-construction of social brain morphology into its elementary building blocks, involving ~10,000 UK Biobank participants. We explored coherent representations of structural co-variation at population scale within a recent social brain atlas, by translating autoencoder neural networks from deep learning. The learned subnetworks revealed essential patterns of structural relationships between social brain regions, with the nucleus accumbens, medial prefrontal cortex, and temporoparietal junction embedded at the core. Some of the uncovered subnetworks contributed to predicting examined social traits in general, while other subnetworks helped predict specific facets of social functioning, such as the experience of social isolation. As a consequence of our population-level evidence, spatially overlapping subsystems of the social brain probably relate to interindividual differences in everyday social life. : Kiesow et al. use deep learning to identify partially overlapping subnetworks in the human social brain at the population level. They also demonstrate that the learned subnetwork representations can be used to predict social traits.","2021","2021-05-19 13:02:23","2021-05-19 13:02:23","","","","1","4","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8881022873","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The present study aimed to explore the predictors of compassion fatigue among a high-risk population of psychological hotline counselors. Seven hundred and twelve psychological hotline counselors were recruited from the Mental Health Service Platform at Central China Normal University, Ministry of Education, then were asked to complete the questionnaires measuring compassion fatigue, trait empathy, social support, trait mindfulness, counselor's self-efficacy, humor, life meaning, and post-traumatic growth. A chi-square test was utilized to filter for the top-20 predictive variables. Machine learning techniques, including logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, k-nearest neighbor, support vector machine, and naïve Bayes were employed to predict compassion fatigue. The results showed that the most important predictors of compassion fatigue were meaning in life, counselors' self-efficacy, mindfulness, and empathy. Except for the decision tree, the rest machine learning techniques obtained good performance. Naïve Bayes presented the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.803. Random forest achieved the least classification error of 23.64, followed by Naïve Bayes with a classification error of 23.85. These findings support the potential application of machine learning techniques in the prediction of compassion fatigue.

Although this promises to deliver increased speed and accuracy, the future role of AI in relation to radiotherapy should be thought through carefully. There is currently a gap between published developments and widespread adoption, which provides some space to prepare the workforce and to consider the implications on practice. It is rare to find philosophical input into a medical journal, but the advent of AI makes this perspective increasingly important. Philosophical insight can help explore the potential impact of AI, in particular, on human creativity and oversight. Without this perspective, we run the risk of focusing solely on the immediate logistical impact on patients and departments. This commentary identifies three key aspects of radiotherapy that the authors feel would suffer most under AI control: creativity, innovation, and patient safety, which all demand uniquely human attributes. The article also provides insight from a philosophical perspective with regard to human consciousness, ethics, and empathy. Philosophically we should, perhaps, retain ethical concerns about the widening role of AI in radiotherapy beyond simple quantitative interpretation and image processing. As developments continue, we have time to determine how our roles will evolve and to establish a framework for ensuring appropriate human input into patient care. Most importantly, we must start to embed a philosophical approach to adoption of AI technology from the outset if we are to prepare ourselves for the challenge that lies ahead.","2019","2021-05-19 13:02:23","2021-05-19 13:02:23","","27","","4","50","","","Artificial Intelligence in Radiotherapy","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8270569034","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this work, we aim to examine AI roles in early design stages. The human ideation components and design tools related to AI are discussed in a framework of AI-augmented design support. The framework develops a hierarchy of design cognition (basis), approaches and principles. The cognitive models are constructed in an empirical study of 30 designers (26 for analysis, 4 for pilot study) by concurrent Think-Aloud protocol and behavior analysis. The process of producing new design ideas is explained by a transparent analysis of designers’ language and behaviors. Three strategies to organize cognitive activities in design ideation are summarized: develop structured consideration, relate to a scenario, and stick-to designing. These strategies suggest AI could act as (1) representation creation, (2) empathy trigger and (3) engagement, in principles of “knowledge-driven” and “decompose-and-integrate”. The design support with AI provides new perspectives on computer-based design tools that limit to well-defined design variables. The framework is built on a generic notion of design activity and “mimic” human design rationales, expected to benefit research of domain-independent computational design supports and cognitive supports.","2020","2021-05-19 13:02:23","2021-05-19 13:02:23","","511-544","","5-6","35","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8655477362","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Machine learning and speech signal processing technologies provide a way to scale up feedback in psychotherapy. We evaluated an initial proof of concept automated feedback system that generates motivational interviewing quality metrics and provides easy access to other session data (e.g., transcripts). The system automatically provides a report of session-level metrics (e.g., therapist empathy) and therapist behavior codes at the talk-turn level (e.g., reflections). We assessed usability, therapist satisfaction, perceived accuracy, and intentions to adopt. A sample of 21 novice (n = 10) or experienced (n = 11) therapists each completed a 10-min session with a standardized patient. The system received the audio from the session as input and then automatically generated feedback that therapists accessed via a web portal. All participants found the system easy to use and were satisfied with their feedback, 83% found the feedback consistent with their own perceptions of their clinical performance, and 90% reported they were likely to use the feedback in their practice.

Contemporary hip preservation practice strives to continually refine and improve the value of care provision. Multiple single-center and multicenter prospective registries continue to grow as part of both United States-based and international hip preservation-specific networks and collaborations. The ability to predict postoperative patient-reported outcomes preoperatively holds great promise with machine learning. Machine learning requires massive amounts of data, which can easily be generated from electronic medical records and both patient- and clinician-generated questionnaires. On top of text-based data, imaging (e.g., plain radiographs, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging) can be rapidly interpreted and used in both clinical practice and research. Formidable computational power is also required, using different advanced statistical methods and algorithms to generate models with the ability to predict individual patient outcomes. Efficient integration of machine learning into hip arthroscopy practice can reduce physicians' ""busywork"" of data collection and analysis.

Patients' perspectives, motivation and capabilities need to be taken into account when developing and assessing the effectiveness of health chatbots.","2019","2021-05-19 13:02:23","2021-05-19 13:02:23","","","","","5","","","Acceptability of artificial intelligence (AI)-led chatbot services in healthcare","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8213188946","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The emerging challenge now is the selection of most discriminative information from high-dimensional data collected from multiple sources. The available fusion algorithms with their complex structure are poorly adopted to the computationally constrained environment which requires integrating information directly at the source. As a result, more simple low-level fusion methods are needed. OBJECTIVE: In the absence of a data combining process, the cost of directly applying high-dimensional raw data to a deep classifier would be computationally expensive with regard to the response time, energy consumption, and memory requirement. Taking this into account, we aimed to develop a data fusion technique in a computationally efficient way to achieve a more comprehensive insight of human activity dynamics in a lower dimension. The major objective was considering statistical dependency of multisensory data and exploring intermodality correlation patterns for different activities. METHODS: In this technique, the information in time (regardless of the number of sources) is transformed into a 2D space that facilitates classification of eating episodes from others. This is based on a hypothesis that data captured by various sensors are statistically associated with each other and the covariance matrix of all these signals has a unique distribution correlated with each activity which can be encoded on a contour representation. These representations are then used as input of a deep model to learn specific patterns associated with specific activity. RESULTS: In order to show the generalizability of the proposed fusion algorithm, 2 different scenarios were taken into account. These scenarios were different in terms of temporal segment size, type of activity, wearable device, subjects, and deep learning architecture. The first scenario used a data set in which a single participant performed a limited number of activities while wearing the Empatica E4 wristband. In the second scenario, a data set related to the activities of daily living was used where 10 different participants wore inertial measurement units while performing a more complex set of activities. The precision metric obtained from leave-one-subject-out cross-validation for the second scenario reached 0.803. The impact of missing data on performance degradation was also evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: To conclude, the proposed fusion technique provides the possibility of embedding joint variability information over different modalities in just a single 2D representation which results in obtaining a more global view of different aspects of daily human activities at hand, and yet preserving the desired performance level in activity recognition.","2021","2021-05-19 13:02:37","2021-05-19 13:02:37","","","","1","9","","","Deep Learning-Based Multimodal Data Fusion","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8895522872","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Multiple high-quality, Level I evidence, randomized, controlled investigations have recently shown the ability of hip arthroscopy to successfully treat femoroacetabular impingement syndrome and labral tears. Contemporary hip preservation practice strives to continually refine and improve the value of care provision. Multiple single-center and multicenter prospective registries continue to grow as part of both United States-based and international hip preservation-specific networks and collaborations. The ability to predict postoperative patient-reported outcomes preoperatively holds great promise with machine learning. Machine learning requires massive amounts of data, which can easily be generated from electronic medical records and both patient- and clinician-generated questionnaires. On top of text-based data, imaging (e.g., plain radiographs, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging) can be rapidly interpreted and used in both clinical practice and research. Formidable computational power is also required, using different advanced statistical methods and algorithms to generate models with the ability to predict individual patient outcomes. Efficient integration of machine learning into hip arthroscopy practice can reduce physicians’ “busywork” of data collection and analysis. This can only improve the value of the patient experience, because surgeons have more time for shared decision making, with empathy, compassion, and humanity counterintuitively returning to medicine.","2021","2021-05-19 13:02:37","2021-05-19 13:02:37","","1498-1502","","5","37","","","Editorial Commentary","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 9015949285","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society. Annual International Conference","","","","","Differentiating epileptic seizures (ES) and psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) is commonly based on electroencephalogram and concurrent video recordings (vEEG). Here, we demonstrate that these two types of seizures can be discriminated based on signals related to autonomic nervous system activity recorded via wearable sensors. We used Empatica E4 Wristband sensors worn on both arms in vEEG confirmed seizures, and machine learning methods to train classifiers, specifically, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). Classification performance achieved a predictive accuracy of 78 ± 1.5% on previously unseen data for whether a seizure was epileptic or psychogenic, which is 6 standard deviations above the baseline of 68% accuracy. Our dataset contained altogether 35 seizures from 18 patients out of which 8 patients had 13 convulsive seizures. Prediction of seizure type was based on simple features derived from the segments of autonomic activity measurements (electrodermal activity, body temperature, blood volume pulse, and heart rate) and forearm acceleration. Features related to heart rate and electrodermal activity were ranked as the top predictors in XGBoost classifiers. We found that patients with PNES had a higher ictal heart rate and electrodermal activity than patients with ES. In contrast to existing published studies of mainly convulsive seizures, our classifier focuses on autonomic signals to differentiate convulsive or nonconvulsive semiology ES from PNES. Our results show that autonomic activity recorded via wearable sensors provides promising signals for detection and discrimination of psychogenic and epileptic seizures, but more work is necessary to improve the predictive power of the model.","2019","2021-05-19 13:02:37","2021-05-19 13:02:37","","3502-3506","","","2019","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8512239741","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Resumo Este artigo explora o futuro dos advogados e dos escritórios de advocacia à luz das mudanças que a Inteligência Artificial (“IA”) já está trazendo para o universo dos serviços jurídicos. A Parte I descreve brevemente algumas das maneiras pelas quais a IA já está sendo usada na vida cotidiana, do reconhecimento facial, passando pelo diagnóstico médico, até os serviços de tradução. A Parte II descreve como a IA está transformando o que significa prestar serviços jurídicos em seis áreas principais: revisão de litígios; automação de expertise; pesquisa legal; análise de contrato; geração de documentos contratuais e contenciosos; e análise preditiva. A Parte III explora quem são os fornecedores desses serviços jurídicos orientados à IA - geralmente prestadores de serviços jurídicos que não são advogados - e como esses prestadores estão substituindo pelo menos parte do que os clientes tradicionalmente procuram em advogados. A Parte III também discute as implicações de todas essas mudanças, tanto para o futuro papel dos advogados individualmente quanto particularmente para os serviços para os quais os clientes ainda precisarão de advogados: julgamento, empatia, criatividade e adaptabilidade. Por sua vez, essa parte examina o que essas mudanças significam para o tamanho, a forma, a composição e o modelo econômico dos escritórios de advocacia, bem como as implicações dessas mudanças na educação jurídica e no treinamento de advogados. A Parte IV identifica as principais questões jurídicas, éticas, regulatórias e de gerenciamento de riscos levantadas pelo uso da IA na prestação de serviços jurídicos. Por fim, na Parte V, considera-se quem serão os prováveis provedores de serviços baseados em IA que não sejam escritórios de advocacia: editores jurídicos, as principais empresas de contabilidade e negócios de capital de risco.","2020","2021-05-19 13:02:37","2021-05-19 13:02:37","","","","1","16","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8586876587","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The survey measured opinions about the likelihood future technology would fully replace physicians in performing ten key psychiatric tasks. This study involved qualitative descriptive analysis of written responses (""comments"") to three open-ended questions in the survey. Results: Comments were classified into four major categories in relation to the impact of future technology on: (1) patient-psychiatrist interactions; (2) the quality of patient medical care; (3) the profession of psychiatry; and (4) health systems. Overwhelmingly, psychiatrists were skeptical that technology could replace human empathy. Many predicted that 'man and machine' would increasingly collaborate in undertaking clinical decisions, with mixed opinions about the benefits and harms of such an arrangement. Participants were optimistic that technology might improve efficiencies and access to care, and reduce costs. Ethical and regulatory considerations received limited attention. Conclusions: This study presents timely information on psychiatrists' views about the scope of artificial intelligence and machine learning on psychiatric practice. Psychiatrists expressed divergent views about the value and impact of future technology with worrying omissions about practice guidelines, and ethical and regulatory issues.","2020","2021-05-19 13:02:52","2021-05-19 13:02:52","","","","","6","","","Artificial intelligence and the future of psychiatry","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8698087734","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The AI era is likely to profoundly impact present system of Health care. Large data storing, processing and its interpretation through Electronic Medical records (EMRs) indicate great potential benefit to health services. Devices are likely to outperform humans, more so cognitively; and coming to terms with this fact require physicians to brace themselves to practice in a technologically enhanced environment. In near future, AI is likely to take a central place in health care with everything revolving round its mechanics. The era of AI envisages new roles of a physician and health professionals should realise the importance of being efficient in interacting with these machines in an efficient manner. Patient psychology and empathy shall take a central place in patient care and budding doctors should be braced with such relevant competencies. Accordingly, AI needs to find a suitable place within the curriculum of medical education that deals with technology, interactive learning environments and managing AI systems. It is also imperative that medical teachers realise the potential of AI on health care and are suitably equipped to train these emerging concepts to future doctors.","2020","2021-05-19 13:03:04","2021-05-19 13:03:04","","JI01-JI02","","3","14","","","Implications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on Dynamics of Medical Education and Care","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8580239240","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We conducted semi-structured interviews with 13 participants to elicit reflections pertaining to the use of AI technology in radiology report interpretation. A thematic analysis approach was employed to analyze the interview data. Participants have a generally positive attitude toward using AI-based systems to comprehend their radiology reports. AI is perceived to be particularly useful in seeking actionable information, confirming the doctor's opinions, and preparing for the consultation. However, we also found various concerns related to the use of AI in this context, such as cyber-security, accuracy, and lack of empathy. Our results highlight the necessity of providing AI explanations to promote people's trust and acceptance of AI.

However, the traditional use of didactic lectures for communication skills training is ineffective, and the use of standardized patients is not time- or cost-effective. Given the abilities of virtual patients (VPs) to simulate interactive and authentic clinical scenarios in secured environments with unlimited training attempts, a virtual counseling application is an ideal platform for nursing students to hone their communication skills before their clinical postings. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop and test the use of VPs to better prepare nursing undergraduates for communicating with real-life patients, their family members, and other health care professionals during their clinical postings. METHODS: The stages of the creation of VPs included preparation, design, and development, followed by a testing phase before the official implementation. An initial voice chatbot was trained using a natural language processing engine, Google Cloud's Dialogflow, and was later visualized into a three-dimensional (3D) avatar form using Unity 3D. RESULTS: The VPs included four case scenarios that were congruent with the nursing undergraduates' semesters' learning objectives: (1) assessing the pain experienced by a pregnant woman, (2) taking the history of a depressed patient, (3) escalating a bleeding episode of a postoperative patient to a physician, and (4) showing empathy to a stressed-out fellow final-year nursing student. Challenges arose in terms of content development, technological limitations, and expectations management, which can be resolved by contingency planning, open communication, constant program updates, refinement, and training. CONCLUSIONS: The creation of VPs to assist in nursing students' communication skills training may provide authentic learning environments that enhance students' perceived self-efficacy and confidence in effective communication skills. However, given the infancy stage of this project, further refinement and constant enhancements are needed to train the VPs to simulate real-life conversations before the official implementation.","2019","2021-05-19 13:03:04","2021-05-19 13:03:04","","","","10","21","","","A Virtual Counseling Application Using Artificial Intelligence for Communication Skills Training in Nursing Education","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8293773349","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore general practitioners' (GPs') opinions about the potential impact of future technology on key tasks in primary care. METHODS: In June 2018, we conducted a Web-based survey of 720 UK GPs' opinions about the likelihood of future technology to fully replace GPs in performing 6 key primary care tasks, and, if respondents considered replacement for a particular task likely, to estimate how soon the technological capacity might emerge. This study involved qualitative descriptive analysis of written responses (""comments"") to an open-ended question in the survey. RESULTS: Comments were classified into 3 major categories in relation to primary care: (1) limitations of future technology, (2) potential benefits of future technology, and (3) social and ethical concerns. Perceived limitations included the beliefs that communication and empathy are exclusively human competencies; many GPs also considered clinical reasoning and the ability to provide value-based care as necessitating physicians' judgments. Perceived benefits of technology included expectations about improved efficiencies, in particular with respect to the reduction of administrative burdens on physicians. Social and ethical concerns encompassed multiple, divergent themes including the need to train more doctors to overcome workforce shortfalls and misgivings about the acceptability of future technology to patients. However, some GPs believed that the failure to adopt technological innovations could incur harms to both patients and physicians. CONCLUSIONS: This study presents timely information on physicians' views about the scope of artificial intelligence (AI) in primary care. Overwhelmingly, GPs considered the potential of AI to be limited. These views differ from the predictions of biomedical informaticians. More extensive, stand-alone qualitative work would provide a more in-depth understanding of GPs' views.","2019","2021-05-19 13:03:04","2021-05-19 13:03:04","","","","3","21","","","Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Primary Care","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8028513010","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Caring is a fundamental characteristic, expectation, and moral obligation of the nursing and caregiving professions (Nursing: Scope and standards of practice, American Nurses Association, Silver Spring, MD, 2015). Along with caring, nurses are expected to undertake ever-expanding duties and complex tasks. In part because of the growing physical, intellectual and emotional demandingness, of nursing as well as technological advances, artificial intelligence (AI) and AI care robots are rapidly changing the healthcare landscape. As technology becomes more advanced, efficient, and economical, opportunities and pressure to introduce AI into nursing care will only increase. In the first part of the article, we review recent and existing applications of AI in nursing and speculate on future use. Second, situate our project within the recent literature on the ethics of nursing and AI. Third, we explore three dominant theories of caring and the two paradigmatic expressions of caring (touch and presence) and conclude that AI—at least for the foreseeable future—is incapable of caring in the sense central to nursing and caregiving ethics. We conclude that for AI to be implemented ethically, it cannot transgress the core values of nursing, usurp aspects of caring that can only meaningfully be carried out by human beings, and it must support, open, or improve opportunities for nurses to provide the uniquely human aspects of care.","2020","2021-05-19 13:03:04","2021-05-19 13:03:04","","","","4","21","","","Artificial Intelligence and Robotics in Nursing","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8671029902","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Exploring and discussing AI and robotics in nursing and health care before these tools become commonplace is of great importance. We propose that monsters in popular culture might be studied with the hope of learning about situations and relationships that generate empathic capacities in their monstrous existences. The aim of the article is to introduce the theoretical framework and assumptions behind this idea. Both robots and monsters are posthuman creations. The knowledge we present here gives ideas about how nursing science can address the postmodern, technologic, and global world to come. Monsters therefore serve as an entrance to explore technologic innovations such as AI. Analyzing when and why monsters step out of character can provide important insights into the conceptualization of caring and nursing as a science, which is important for discussing these empathic protocols, as well as more general insight into human knowledge. The relationship between caring, monsters, robotics, and AI is not as farfetched as it might seem at first glance.","2016","2021-05-19 13:03:04","2021-05-19 13:03:04","","15-243","","3","20","","","Future Challenges of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence in Nursing","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 6778730008","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Co-design workshops with general practitioners were conducted. The workshops focused on (1) understanding the current consultation context and identifying existing problems, (2) ideating future solutions to these problems, and (3) discussing future roles for AI in primary care. The workshop activities included affinity diagramming, brainwriting, and video prototyping methods. The workshops were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Inductive thematic analysis of the transcripts of conversations was performed. RESULTS: Two researchers facilitated 3 co-design workshops with 16 general practitioners. Three main themes emerged: professional autonomy, human-AI collaboration, and new models of care. Major implications identified within these themes included (1) concerns with medico-legal aspects arising from constant recording and accessibility of full consultation records, (2) future consultations taking place out of the exam rooms in a distributed system involving empowered patients, (3) human conversation and empathy remaining the core tasks of doctors in any future AI-enabled consultations, and (4) questioning the current focus of AI initiatives on improved efficiency as opposed to patient care. CONCLUSIONS: AI documentation assistants will likely to be integral to the future primary care consultations. However, these technologies will still need to be supervised by a human until strong evidence for reliable autonomous performance is available. Therefore, different human-AI collaboration models will need to be designed and evaluated to ensure patient safety, quality of care, doctor safety, and doctor autonomy.","2020","2021-05-19 13:03:15","2021-05-19 13:03:15","","1695-1704","","11","27","","","Envisioning an artificial intelligence documentation assistant for future primary care consultations","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8655795118","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Major depression is associated with impaired psychosocial functioning and reduced quality of life. Challenges such as shortage of mental health personnel, long waiting times, perceived stigma, and lower government spends pose barriers to the alleviation of mental health problems. Face-to-face psychotherapy alone provides only point-in-time support and cannot scale quickly enough to address this growing global public health challenge. Artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled, empathetic, and evidence-driven conversational mobile app technologies could play an active role in filling this gap by increasing adoption and enabling reach. Although such a technology can help manage these barriers, they should never replace time with a health care professional for more severe mental health problems. However, app technologies could act as a supplementary or intermediate support system. Mobile mental well-being apps need to uphold privacy and foster both short- and long-term positive outcomes.            ObjectiveThis study aimed to present a preliminary real-world data evaluation of the effectiveness and engagement levels of an AI-enabled, empathetic, text-based conversational mobile mental well-being app, Wysa, on users with self-reported symptoms of depression.            MethodsIn the study, a group of anonymous global users were observed who voluntarily installed the Wysa app, engaged in text-based messaging, and self-reported symptoms of depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. On the basis of the extent of app usage on and between 2 consecutive screening time points, 2 distinct groups of users (high users and low users) emerged. The study used mixed-methods approach to evaluate the impact and engagement levels among these users. The quantitative analysis measured the app impact by comparing the average improvement in symptoms of depression between high and low users. The qualitative analysis measured the app engagement and experience by analyzing in-app user feedback and evaluated the performance of a machine learning classifier to detect user objections during conversations.            ResultsThe average mood improvement (ie, difference in pre- and post-self-reported depression scores) between the groups (ie, high vs low users; n=108 and n=21, respectively) revealed that the high users group had significantly higher average improvement (mean 5.84 [SD 6.66]) compared with the low users group (mean 3.52 [SD 6.15]); Mann-Whitney P=.03 and with a moderate effect size of 0.63. Moreover, 67.7% of user-provided feedback responses found the app experience helpful and encouraging.            ConclusionsThe real-world data evaluation findings on the effectiveness and engagement levels of Wysa app on users with self-reported symptoms of depression show promise. However, further work is required to validate these initial findings in much larger samples and across longer periods.","2018","2021-05-19 13:03:15","2021-05-19 13:03:15","","","","11","6","","","An Empathy-Driven, Conversational Artificial Intelligence Agent (Wysa) for Digital Mental Well-Being","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8974730299","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

From an organizational perspective, AI devices have several advantages, by performing certain tasks quicker and more accurately in comparison to humans while at the same time being more cost-efficient. However, in order to maintain the high standards of a brand, they have to be accepted by consumers and deliver socially adequate performance. Therefore, it is important to determine the characteristics of AI devices which make them accepted and trusted by consumers. Based on the Computers as Social Actors (CASA) Theory, we have researched on the role of psychological anthropomorphic characteristics, perceived empathy, and interaction quality in the acceptance of AI devices in the service industry. The results show that anthropomorphic characteristics alone do not influence acceptance and trust towards AI devices. However, both perceived empathy and interaction quality mediate the relation between anthropomorphic characteristics and acceptance. A human-like AI device has higher acceptance when it has the ability to show empathy and interaction in relation to the human consumer. This result reveals the importance of developing forms of strong intelligence and empathetic behaviour in service robots and AI devices.","2021","2021-05-19 13:03:15","2021-05-19 13:03:15","","","","","","","","What makes an AI device human-like?","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 9030061263","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This research attempts to model specific forms of intelligence through brute-force search heuristics and also reproduce features of human perception and cognition, including emotions. Such goals have implications for artificial consciousness, with some arguing that it will be achievable once we overcome short-term engineering challenges. We believe, however, that phenomenal consciousness cannot be implemented in machines. This becomes clear when considering emotions and examining the dissociation between consciousness and attention in humans. While we may be able to program ethical behavior based on rules and machine learning, we will never be able to reproduce emotions or empathy by programming such control systems—these will be merely simulations. Arguments in favor of this claim include considerations about evolution, the neuropsychological aspects of emotions, and the dissociation between attention and consciousness found in humans.

XiaoIce is uniquely designed as an artifical intelligence companion with an emotional connection to satisfy the human need for communication, affection, and social belonging. We take into account both intelligent quotient and emotional quotient in system design, cast human-machine social chat as decision-making over Markov Decision Processes, and optimize XiaoIce for long-term user engagement, measured in expected Conversation-turns Per Session (CPS). We detail the system architecture and key components, including dialogue manager, core chat, skills, and an empathetic computing module. We show how XiaoIce dynamically recognizes human feelings and states, understands user intent, and responds to user needs throughout long conversations. Since the release in 2014, XiaoIce has communicated with over 660 million active users and succeeded in establishing long-term relationships with many of them. Analysis of large-scale online logs shows that XiaoIce has achieved an average CPS of 23, which is significantly higher than that of other chatbots and even human conversations.","2020","2021-05-19 13:04:04","2021-05-19 13:04:04","","53-93","","1","46","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8498791012","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Google promotes a new form of “infrastructural intelligence,” which excels by constantly reassessing its cognitive architecture in exchange with a cloud of data that surrounds it, and exhibits putatively human capacities such as intuition. I argue that such (re)alignments of biological and artificial intelligence have been enabled by a paradigmatic infrastructuralization of the brain in contemporary neuroscience. This infrastructuralization is based in methodologies that epistemically liken the brain to complex systems of an entirely different scale (i.e., global logistics) and has given rise to diverse research efforts that target the neuronal infrastructures of higher cognitive functions such as empathy and creativity. What is at stake in this process is no less than the shape of brains to come and a revised understanding of the intelligent and creative social subject.","2017","2021-05-19 13:04:09","2021-05-19 13:04:09","","101-128","","","233","","","Infrastructural intelligence","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 7111668666","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

She approaches this goal with an example software agent, EM-2. She also gives a generalized software requirements guide for anyone wishing to pursue other means of building compassionate intelligence into an AI system. The purpose of EM-2 is not to build an agent with a state of mind that mimics empathy or consciousness, but rather to create practical applications of AI systems with knowledge and reasoning methods that positively take into account the feelings and state of self and others during decision making, action, or problem solving. To program EM-2 the author re-purposes code and architectural ideas from collaborative multi-agent systems and affective common sense reasoning with new concepts and philosophies from the human arts and sciences relating to compassion. EM-2 has predicates and an agent architecture based on a meta-cognition mental process that was used on India's worst prisoners to cultivate compassion for others, Vipassana or mindfulness. She describes and presents code snippets for common sense based affective inference and the I-TMS, an Irrational Truth Maintenance System, that maintains consistency in agent memory as feelings change over time, and provides a machine theoretic description of the consistency issues of combining affect and logic.

However, a proper integration of IHRs requires a detailed description and explanation of their essential capabilities, particularly regarding their competencies in replicating and portraying emotive functions such as empathy. Existing humanoid robots can exhibit rudimentary forms of empathy; as these machines slowly become commonplace in healthcare settings, they will be expected to express empathy as a natural function, rather than merely to portray artificial empathy as a replication of human empathy. This article works with a twofold purpose: firstly, to consider the impact of artificial empathy in nursing and, secondly, to describe the influence of Affective Developmental Robotics (ADR) in anticipation of the empathic behaviour presented by artificial humanoid robots. The ADR has demonstrated that it can be one means by which humanoid nurse robots can achieve expressions of more relatable artificial empathy. This will be one of the vital models for intelligent humanoid robots currently in nurse robot development for the healthcare industry. A discussion of IHRs demonstrating artificial empathy is critical to nursing practice today, particularly in healthcare settings dense with technology.","2020","2021-05-19 13:04:23","2021-05-19 13:04:23","","","","4","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8885013400","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Teens are a unique population given their vulnerability to stress leading to both mental and physical illness. Much of teen stress stems from school, making the school environment an ideal location for a stress reducing technology. The goal of this mixed-methods study was to understand teens' operation of, and responsiveness to, a robot only capable of movement compared to a robot only capable of speech. Stemming from a human-centered approach, we introduce a Participatory Wizard of Oz (PWoz) interaction method that engaged teens as operators, users, and witnesses in a uniquely transparent interaction. In this paper, we illustrate the use of the PWoz interaction method as well as how it helps identify engaging robot interactions. Using this technique, we present results from a study with 62 teens that includes details of the complexity of teen stress and a significant reduction in negative attitudes toward robots after interactions. We analyzed the teens' interactions with both the verbal and non-verbal robots and identified strong themes of (1) authenticity, (2) empathy, (3) emotional engagement, and (4) imperfection creates connection. Finally, we reflect on the benefits and limitations of the PWoz method and our study to identify next steps toward the design and development of our social robot.","2020","2021-05-19 13:04:36","2021-05-19 13:04:36","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8538982335","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we investigated the influence of the visualization of a real-time personalized avatar on gait parameters, focusing on knee flexion during the swing phase. We also studied the impact of the modification of avatar's knee amplitude on kinematic of the knee of healthy subjects. For this purpose, we used an immersive reality treadmill equipment and developed a 3D avatar, with instantly modifiable parameters for knee flexion and extension (acceleration or deceleration). Fourteen healthy young adults, equipped with motion capture markers, were asked to walk at a self-selected pace on the treadmill. A real-time 3D image of their lower limbs was modelized and projected on the screen ahead of them, as if in a walking motion from left to right. The subjects were instructed to continue walking. When we initiated an increase in the knee flexion of the avatar, we observed a similar increase in the subjects' knee flexion. No significant results were observed when the modification involved a decrease in knee flexion. The results and their significance are discussed using theories encompassing empathy, sympathy and sensory re-calibration. The prospect of using this type of modified avatar for stroke rehabilitation is discussed.","2019","2021-05-19 13:04:36","2021-05-19 13:04:36","","e02797","","11","5","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8464682346","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Given that congruence in perceived representations of the world enable humans to experience commonality in mental states (a shared reality), we propose that congruence between humans, and robots will encourage humans to attribute humanlike mental capacities to robots. To investigate this, we assessed the mental perceptions of a robot in a visual imagination task using Gray et al. mind perception scale, which evaluates experience (capacity to feel), and agency (capacity to plan and do). For each ambiguous picture in the designed task, humans, and a robot imagined an animal. The task was performed under six conditions (2 × 3: Lead/Follow for Low/Medium/High). In the Lead condition, the robot records its perceived animal first; in the Follow condition, the robot records after the human participant. The experiment had three different degrees of congruence: Low (0%), Medium (60%), and High (100%). The results showed that perceived experiences were higher in the Lead condition, suggesting that the robot is perceived to be empathetic. It is probable that the Follow condition was perceived as mimicry rather than shared reality. Therefore, the order of response may have played an important role in commonality in mental states. No differences were observed in the perceived agency across all conditions. These results suggest that the order of response affects how humans perceive the minds of robots. Additionally, we assessed a post-task questionnaire to evaluate the interpersonal closeness that the humans felt toward the android. The main effect was observed in the degrees of congruence. This result is in line with those of previous studies that report relationships across sharing of similarities and friendliness.","2019","2021-05-19 13:04:36","2021-05-19 13:04:36","","","","","6","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8773072243","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Series B, Biological sciences","","0962-8436","","","To what extent can humans form social relationships with robots? In the present study, we combined functional neuroimaging with a robot socializing intervention to probe the flexibility of empathy, a core component of social relationships, towards robots. Twenty-six individuals underwent identical fMRI sessions before and after being issued a social robot to take home and interact with over the course of a week. While undergoing fMRI, participants observed videos of a human actor or a robot experiencing pain or pleasure in response to electrical stimulation. Repetition suppression of activity in the pain network, a collection of brain regions associated with empathy and emotional responding, was measured to test whether socializing with a social robot leads to greater overlap in neural mechanisms when observing human and robotic agents experiencing pain or pleasure. In contrast to our hypothesis, functional region-of-interest analyses revealed no change in neural overlap for agents after the socializing intervention. Similarly, no increase in activation when observing a robot experiencing pain emerged post-socializing. Whole-brain analysis showed that, before the socializing intervention, superior parietal and early visual regions are sensitive to novel agents, while after socializing, medial temporal regions show agent sensitivity. A region of the inferior parietal lobule was sensitive to novel emotions, but only during the pre-socializing scan session. Together, these findings suggest that a short socialization intervention with a social robot does not lead to discernible differences in empathy towards the robot, as measured by behavioural or brain responses. We discuss the extent to which long-term socialization with robots might shape social cognitive processes and ultimately our relationships with these machines.

ObjectiveThis study aimed to benchmark multiple methods of text feature representation for social media posts and compare their downstream use with automated machine learning (AutoML) tools. We tested on datasets that contain posts labeled for perceived suicide risk or moderator attention in the context of self-harm. Specifically, we assessed the ability of the methods to prioritize posts that a moderator would identify for immediate response.            MethodsWe used 1588 labeled posts from the Computational Linguistics and Clinical Psychology (CLPsych) 2017 shared task collected from the Reachout.com forum. Posts were represented using lexicon-based tools, including Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner, Empath, and Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count, and also using pretrained artificial neural network models, including DeepMoji, Universal Sentence Encoder, and Generative Pretrained Transformer-1 (GPT-1). We used Tree-based Optimization Tool and Auto-Sklearn as AutoML tools to generate classifiers to triage the posts.            ResultsThe top-performing system used features derived from the GPT-1 model, which was fine-tuned on over 150,000 unlabeled posts from Reachout.com. Our top system had a macroaveraged F1 score of 0.572, providing a new state-of-the-art result on the CLPsych 2017 task. This was achieved without additional information from metadata or preceding posts. Error analyses revealed that this top system often misses expressions of hopelessness. In addition, we have presented visualizations that aid in the understanding of the learned classifiers.            ConclusionsIn this study, we found that transfer learning is an effective strategy for predicting risk with relatively little labeled data and noted that fine-tuning of pretrained language models provides further gains when large amounts of unlabeled text are available.","2020","2021-05-19 13:04:50","2021-05-19 13:04:50","","","","5","22","","","Transfer Learning for Risk Classification of Social Media Posts","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8974715934","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Posts were represented using lexicon-based tools, including Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner, Empath, and Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count, and also using pretrained artificial neural network models, including DeepMoji, Universal Sentence Encoder, and Generative Pretrained Transformer-1 (GPT-1). We used Tree-based Optimization Tool and Auto-Sklearn as AutoML tools to generate classifiers to triage the posts. RESULTS: The top-performing system used features derived from the GPT-1 model, which was fine-tuned on over 150,000 unlabeled posts from Reachout.com. Our top system had a macroaveraged F1 score of 0.572, providing a new state-of-the-art result on the CLPsych 2017 task. This was achieved without additional information from metadata or preceding posts. Error analyses revealed that this top system often misses expressions of hopelessness. In addition, we have presented visualizations that aid in the understanding of the learned classifiers. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we found that transfer learning is an effective strategy for predicting risk with relatively little labeled data and noted that fine-tuning of pretrained language models provides further gains when large amounts of unlabeled text are available.","2020","2021-05-19 13:04:50","2021-05-19 13:04:50","","","","5","22","","","Transfer Learning for Risk Classification of Social Media Posts","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8591946679","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A growing number of electroencephalography studies also suggest that it might be useful to assess empathy. The main goal of this study was to use quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) to test whether observation of pain expressed by an avatar (virtual reality) induces a suppression of alpha waves over sensorimotor cortical areas, as it is observed with human stimuli. Not only was it the case, but also the magnitude of alpha suppression was correlated with perspective-taking capacity of participants. Both empathy levels and magnitude of sensorimotor alpha suppression (SAS) were significantly higher in women than men. Interestingly, a significant interaction emerged between levels of individual empathy and specificity of experimental instructions, where SAS in participants with good perspective-taking was higher during passive observation of the distressed avatar, while the opposite was true during an active (trying to understand) condition. These results suggest that: (1) synthetic characters are able to elicit SAS; (2) SAS is indeed associated with perspective-taking capacities; (3) Persons with poorer perspective-taking capacities can show significant SAS when proper instructions are provided. Therefore, qEEG represents a low-cost objective approach to measure perspective-taking abilities.","2018","2021-05-19 13:04:50","2021-05-19 13:04:50","","","","","","","","Suppression of Sensorimotor Alpha Power Associated With Pain Expressed by an Avatar","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 7787156798","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One such approach involves asking participants to inflict ‘harm’ on a robot. Researchers are interested in the length of time between the experimenter issuing the instruction and the participant complying, and propose that relatively long periods of hesitation might reflect empathy for the robot, and perhaps even attribution of human-like qualities, such as agency and sentience. In a recent experiment, we adapted the so-called ‘hesitance to hit’ paradigm, in which participants were instructed to hit a humanoid robot on the head with a mallet. After standing up to do so (signaling intent to hit the robot), participants were stopped, and then took part in a semi-structured interview to probe their thoughts and feelings during the period of hesitation. Thematic analysis of the responses indicate that hesitation not only reflects perceived socialness, but also other factors including (but not limited to) concerns about cost, mallet disbelief, processing of the task instruction, and the influence of authority. The open-ended, free responses participants provided also offer rich insights into individual differences with regards to anthropomorphism, perceived power imbalances, and feelings of connection toward the robot. In addition to aiding understanding of this measurement technique and related topics regarding socialness attribution to robots, we argue that greater use of open questions can lead to exciting new research questions and interdisciplinary collaborations in the domain of social robotics.","2021","2021-05-19 13:04:50","2021-05-19 13:04:50","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8974715529","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, RAT using humanoid robots is still a novel practice for which the adhesion mechanisms, indications and benefits remain unclear. Also, little is known about how the robot's behavioral and affective style might promote engagement of persons with dementia (PwD) in RAT. The present study sought to investigate the use of a humanoid robot in a psychomotor therapy for PwD. We examined the robot's potential to engage participants in the intervention and its effect on their emotional state. A brief psychomotor therapy program involving the robot as the therapist's assistant was created. For this purpose, a corpus of social and physical behaviors for the robot and a “control software” for customizing the program and operating the robot were also designed. Particular attention was given to components of the RAT that could promote participant's engagement (robot's interaction style, personalization of contents). In the pilot assessment of the intervention nine PwD (7 women and 2 men, M age = 86 y/o) hospitalized in a geriatrics unit participated in four individual therapy sessions: one classic therapy (CT) session (patient- therapist) and three RAT sessions (patient-therapist-robot). Outcome criteria for the evaluation of the intervention included: participant's engagement, emotional state and well-being; satisfaction of the intervention, appreciation of the robot, and empathy-related behaviors in human-robot interaction (HRI). Results showed a high constructive engagement in both CT and RAT sessions. More positive emotional responses in participants were observed in RAT compared to CT. RAT sessions were better appreciated than CT sessions. The use of a social robot as a mediating tool appeared to promote the involvement of PwD in the therapeutic intervention increasing their immediate wellbeing and satisfaction.","2017","2021-05-19 13:05:31","2021-05-19 13:05:31","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8539390815","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous studies have shown that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is effective in improving attention deficit symptoms. However, many patients are not receiving adequate treatment due to time, space, and cost constraints. Recently, in other mental illnesses, mobile-based chatbots delivering CBT and psychoeducation have been used for symptom mitigation and treatment. This study aimed to investigate the feasibility and usability of a short-term intervention, specifically a mobile-based interactive chatbot application, in alleviating attention deficit symptoms. This was a randomized, non-blind parallel-group pilot study conducted from September 2019 to March 2020. Forty-six individuals with attention deficit aged 19-60 were randomly allocated to the chatbot (n = 23) and information-only control groups (n = 23) for 4 weeks. The former group was instructed to use the chatbot application “Todaki,” while the latter group was provided with a book on managing attention deficit symptoms. Participants were administered questionnaires to assess their symptoms of attention deficit, depression, and anxiety and evaluated at baseline and 4 weeks after the intervention. The post-intervention survey assessed the chatbot’s usability, acceptability, and side effects. The average age of the participants was 25.1 years (standard deviation [SD] 7.5 years), and 56.5 % (26/46) participants were female. Intention-to-treat analysis (chatbot, n = 23; control, n = 23) revealed a significant reduction of attention deficit symptoms only in the chatbot group, which is represented by group-by-time interaction in Conner’s Adult ADHD Rating Scale subscales of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-IV Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Hyperactive-Impulsive symptoms (F = 4.39; p = .04) and ADHD symptoms total (F = 6.74, p = .01). Further, the results of the paired <ce:italic>t</ce:italic>-test were significant only in the chatbot group. The average number of times the chatbots were used in 4 weeks was 20.32 (SD 12.89). The total average usage time was 1 h 15 min (SD 1 h 20 min). The degree of improvement in the ADHD symptoms total score was correlated with the number of times the psychoeducation program was used. According to the participants, the empathic/friendly character and unnatural flow of conversation were the best and worst features of the chatbot, respectively. This study identified the feasibility and usability of using the mobile-based chatbot to improve attention deficit and its associated psychiatric symptoms. Using this novel intervention to conduct CBT would provide a useful digital therapeutic tool that allows easy accessibility and self-guided management for people with attention deficit, which should be verified through the large scale randomized controlled trial.","2021","2021-05-19 13:05:31","2021-05-19 13:05:31","","","","","150","","","Mobile app-based chatbot to deliver cognitive behavioral therapy and psychoeducation for adults with attention deficit","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8973573870","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This theory has been originated from the last two decades advancements of systems medicine and digital medicine, science and technology convergence in biological fields and formation of the precision medicine. The transcendent medicine theory that has been derived from Sadr ad-Din Shirazi’s transcendent theosophy looks to medicine with a holistic view.Materials and Methods: In extension of the theory of Transcendent medicine, we discussed paradigm shift in medicine with deep medicine theory and its three components were challenged via the viewpoints of transcendent medicine.Results: The body theosophy which has been derived from the transcendent medicine theory is the counterpart of “deep phenotyping” component of deep medicine. The speculative reason of Ibn-Sins’s science of soul which has been projected in transcendent medicine theory could be compare with “deep learning” component of deep medicine theory. With extraction of Ibn-Arabi’s concept of perfect man and its integration with transcendent medicine, the advanced model this theory could present “deep empathy”, the third component of deep medicine.Conclusion: The transcendent medicine theory expresses all three components of deep medicine in a unique form.

Mind perception also modulates the attitudes we have toward others, and determines the degree of empathy, prosociality, and morality invested in social interactions. Seeing mind in others is not exclusive to human agents, but mind can also be ascribed to non-human agents like robots, as long as their appearance and/or behavior allows them to be perceived as intentional beings. Previous studies have shown that human appearance and reliable behavior induce mind perception to robot agents, and positively affect attitudes and performance in human-robot interaction. What has not been investigated so far is whether different triggers of mind perception have an independent or interactive effect on attitudes and performance in human-robot interaction. We examine this question by manipulating agent appearance (human vs. robot) and behavior (reliable vs. random) within the same paradigm and examine how congruent (human/reliable vs. robot/random) versus incongruent (human/random vs. robot/reliable) combinations of these triggers affect performance (i.e., gaze following) and attitudes (i.e., agent ratings) in human-robot interaction. The results show that both appearance and behavior affect human-robot interaction but that the two triggers seem to operate in isolation, with appearance more strongly impacting attitudes, and behavior more strongly affecting performance. The implications of these findings for human-robot interaction are discussed.","2017","2021-05-19 13:05:31","2021-05-19 13:05:31","","","","","8","","","You Look Human, But Act Like a Machine","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 7123402545","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, RAT using humanoid robots is still a novel practice for which the adhesion mechanisms, indications and benefits remain unclear. Also, little is known about how the robot's behavioral and affective style might promote engagement of persons with dementia (PwD) in RAT. The present study sought to investigate the use of a humanoid robot in a psychomotor therapy for PwD. We examined the robot's potential to engage participants in the intervention and its effect on their emotional state. A brief psychomotor therapy program involving the robot as the therapist's assistant was created. For this purpose, a corpus of social and physical behaviors for the robot and a “control software” for customizing the program and operating the robot were also designed. Particular attention was given to components of the RAT that could promote participant's engagement (robot's interaction style, personalization of contents). In the pilot assessment of the intervention nine PwD (7 women and 2 men, M age = 86 y/o) hospitalized in a geriatrics unit participated in four individual therapy sessions: one classic therapy (CT) session (patient- therapist) and three RAT sessions (patient-therapist-robot). Outcome criteria for the evaluation of the intervention included: participant's engagement, emotional state and well-being; satisfaction of the intervention, appreciation of the robot, and empathy-related behaviors in human-robot interaction (HRI). Results showed a high constructive engagement in both CT and RAT sessions. More positive emotional responses in participants were observed in RAT compared to CT. RAT sessions were better appreciated than CT sessions. The use of a social robot as a mediating tool appeared to promote the involvement of PwD in the therapeutic intervention increasing their immediate wellbeing and satisfaction.","2017","2021-06-05 10:37:04","2021-06-05 10:37:04","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8539390815","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Internal motivational factors for studying medicine (e.g., care for patients, save lives) coupled with a deep approach to learning have been positively related to empathy in contrast to external motivational factors (e.g., future earning potential, prestige) and surface learning. However, assessments of these assumptions among medical school candidates are scarce. This study examined the relationship between different motivational factors and empathy among students enrolled in a selection year in medicine by testing the mediating role of learning approaches. A sample of 572 candidates for medical studies answered a self-reported questionnaire half way through their selection year. Measures included internal and external motivational factors for studying medicine, deep and surface learning approaches and empathy. Path-analysis tested the mediation effects of deep and surface approaches to learning on the relationship of internal and external motivational factors with empathy. The deep learning approach partially mediated the significant positive association between internal motivational factors and empathy, while the surface learning approach fully mediated the significant negative association between external motivational factors and empathy. These results suggest that learning approaches could be a pathway by which internal and external motives for studying medicine are related to empathy among medical school candidates. Pedagogical strategies and educational environments accounting for individual differences in motivation and learning may contribute to training students to become professional and caring doctors in the future.","2019","2021-06-05 10:37:04","2021-06-05 10:37:04","","287-300","","2","24","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","Publisher: Springer.

Previous studies have shown that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is effective in improving attention deficit symptoms. However, many patients are not receiving adequate treatment due to time, space, and cost constraints. Recently, in other mental illnesses, mobile-based chatbots delivering CBT and psychoeducation have been used for symptom mitigation and treatment. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the feasibility and usability of a short-term intervention, specifically a mobile-based interactive chatbot application, in alleviating attention deficit symptoms. METHODS: This was a randomized, non-blind parallel-group pilot study conducted from September 2019 to March 2020. Forty-six individuals with attention deficit aged 19-60 were randomly allocated to the chatbot (n = 23) and information-only control groups (n = 23) for 4 weeks. The former group was instructed to use the chatbot application ""Todaki,"" while the latter group was provided with a book on managing attention deficit symptoms. Participants were administered questionnaires to assess their symptoms of attention deficit, depression, and anxiety and evaluated at baseline and 4 weeks after the intervention. The post-intervention survey assessed the chatbot's usability, acceptability, and side effects. RESULTS: The average age of the participants was 25.1 years (standard deviation [SD] 7.5 years), and 56.5 % (26/46) participants were female. Intention-to-treat analysis (chatbot, n = 23; control, n = 23) revealed a significant reduction of attention deficit symptoms only in the chatbot group, which is represented by group-by-time interaction in Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale subscales of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-IV Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Hyperactive-Impulsive symptoms (F = 4.39; p = .04) and ADHD symptoms total (F = 6.74, p = .01). Further, the results of the paired t-test were significant only in the chatbot group. The average number of times the chatbots were used in 4 weeks was 20.32 (SD 12.89). The total average usage time was 1 h 15 min (SD 1 h 20 min). The degree of improvement in the ADHD symptoms total score was correlated with the number of times the psychoeducation program was used. According to the participants, the empathic/friendly character and unnatural flow of conversation were the best and worst features of the chatbot, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified the feasibility and usability of using the mobile-based chatbot to improve attention deficit and its associated psychiatric symptoms. Using this novel intervention to conduct CBT would provide a useful digital therapeutic tool that allows easy accessibility and self-guided management for people with attention deficit, which should be verified through the large scale randomized controlled trial.","2021","2021-06-05 10:37:04","2021-06-05 10:37:04","","","","","150","","","Mobile app-based chatbot to deliver cognitive behavioral therapy and psychoeducation for adults with attention deficit","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8983892028","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This theory has been originated from the last two decades advancements of systems medicine and digital medicine, science and technology convergence in biological fields and formation of the precision medicine. The transcendent medicine theory that has been derived from Sadr ad-Din Shirazi’s transcendent theosophy looks to medicine with a holistic view.Materials and Methods: In extension of the theory of Transcendent medicine, we discussed paradigm shift in medicine with deep medicine theory and its three components were challenged via the viewpoints of transcendent medicine.Results: The body theosophy which has been derived from the transcendent medicine theory is the counterpart of “deep phenotyping” component of deep medicine. The speculative reason of Ibn-Sins’s science of soul which has been projected in transcendent medicine theory could be compare with “deep learning” component of deep medicine theory. With extraction of Ibn-Arabi’s concept of perfect man and its integration with transcendent medicine, the advanced model this theory could present “deep empathy”, the third component of deep medicine.Conclusion: The transcendent medicine theory expresses all three components of deep medicine in a unique form. Hence, this theory could be used as a tool in the paradigm shift of modern medicine.","2020","2021-06-05 10:37:04","2021-06-05 10:37:04","","70-86","","1","23","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8580238094","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Mind perception also modulates the attitudes we have toward others, and determines the degree of empathy, prosociality, and morality invested in social interactions. Seeing mind in others is not exclusive to human agents, but mind can also be ascribed to non-human agents like robots, as long as their appearance and/or behavior allows them to be perceived as intentional beings. Previous studies have shown that human appearance and reliable behavior induce mind perception to robot agents, and positively affect attitudes and performance in human-robot interaction. What has not been investigated so far is whether different triggers of mind perception have an independent or interactive effect on attitudes and performance in human-robot interaction. We examine this question by manipulating agent appearance (human vs. robot) and behavior (reliable vs. random) within the same paradigm and examine how congruent (human/reliable vs. robot/random) versus incongruent (human/random vs. robot/reliable) combinations of these triggers affect performance (i.e., gaze following) and attitudes (i.e., agent ratings) in human-robot interaction. The results show that both appearance and behavior affect human-robot interaction but that the two triggers seem to operate in isolation, with appearance more strongly impacting attitudes, and behavior more strongly affecting performance. The implications of these findings for human-robot interaction are discussed.","2017","2021-06-05 10:37:04","2021-06-05 10:37:04","","","","","8","","","You Look Human, But Act Like a Machine","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 7123402545","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Students’ empathy was assessed through a questionnaire. Overall, 345 students (11 to 13 years old) from six schools located in three different areas of Tehran, Iran, participated in this study, selected by multistage cluster sampling. In this method, similar samples are classified in one cluster and, then, clusters can be labeled based on their attributes (empathy measures). Two teacher-reported and student-reported questionnaires were used to assess the learning behavior and empathy levels of students. Questionnaires were completed by the students and their teachers during school year 2017 and 2018 (from autumn 2017 to spring 2018). All calculations were performed in MATLAB, a multi-purpose programming environment.<strong>Results:</strong> Although statistical parameters showed a strong relationship between students’ empathy and their learning behaviors, AI clustering process provides a more exact analysis due to its nature. The results revealed a significant relationship between empathy scores and learning among male students. A P value of 0.0031 indicates a meaningful relationship between empathy scores and learning behavior measures.<strong>Conclusions:</strong> Number of students in each cluster showed that females are more uniform than males in the sense of empathy. Cultural backgrounds have significant effects on answers to questions. Processes revealed a meaningful difference between males and females when their connection of empathy and learning behaviors were investigated.

In this article, this hypothesis is argued from several viewpoints towards its verification. A developmental process of empathy, morality, and ethics based on the mirror neuron system (MNS) that promotes the emergence of the concept of self (and others) scaffolds the emergence of artificial minds. Firstly, an outline of the ideological background on issues of the mind in a broad sense is shown, followed by the limitation of the current progress of artificial intelligence (AI), focusing on deep learning. Next, artificial pain is introduced, along with its architectures in the early stage of self-inflicted experiences of pain, and later, in the sharing stage of the pain between self and others. Then, cognitive developmental robotics (CDR) is revisited for two important concepts&#8212;physical embodiment and social interaction, both of which help to shape conscious minds. Following the working hypothesis, existing studies of CDR are briefly introduced and missing issues are indicated. Finally, the issue of how robots (artificial systems) could be moral agents is addressed.","2019","2021-06-05 11:19:22","2021-06-05 11:19:22","","38-0","","3","4","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8207501315","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A mobile health intervention utilizing a fully automated text-based health care chatbot (TBHC) may offer an innovative way not only to deliver coping strategies and psychoeducation for pain management but also to build a working alliance between a participant and the TBHC.            ObjectiveThe objectives of this study are twofold: (1) to describe the design and implementation to promote the chatbot painSELfMAnagement (SELMA), a 2-month smartphone-based cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) TBHC intervention for pain self-management in patients with ongoing or cyclic pain, and (2) to present findings from a pilot randomized controlled trial, in which effectiveness, influence of intention to change behavior, pain duration, working alliance, acceptance, and adherence were evaluated.            MethodsParticipants were recruited online and in collaboration with pain experts, and were randomized to interact with SELMA for 8 weeks either every day or every other day concerning CBT-based pain management (n=59), or weekly concerning content not related to pain management (n=43). Pain-related impairment (primary outcome), general well-being, pain intensity, and the bond scale of working alliance were measured at baseline and postintervention. Intention to change behavior and pain duration were measured at baseline only, and acceptance postintervention was assessed via self-reporting instruments. Adherence was assessed via usage data.            ResultsFrom May 2018 to August 2018, 311 adults downloaded the SELMA app, 102 of whom consented to participate and met the inclusion criteria. The average age of the women (88/102, 86.4%) and  men (14/102, 13.6%) participating was 43.7 (SD 12.7) years. Baseline group comparison did not differ with respect to any demographic or clinical variable. The intervention group reported no significant change in pain-related impairment (P=.68) compared to the control group postintervention. The intention to change behavior was positively related to pain-related impairment (P=.01) and pain intensity (P=.01). Working alliance with the TBHC SELMA was comparable to that obtained in guided internet therapies with human coaches. Participants enjoyed using the app, perceiving it as useful and easy to use. Participants of the intervention group replied with an average answer ratio of 0.71 (SD 0.20) to 200 (SD 58.45) conversations initiated by SELMA.

Goal conflicts can arise from simple trajectory planning to complex task prioritization. For successful human-robot goal-conflict resolution, humans and robots need to negotiate their goals and priorities. For this, the robot might be equipped with effective conflict resolution strategies to be assertive and effective but similarly accepted by the user. In this paper, conflict resolution strategies for service robots (public cleaning robot, home assistant robot) are developed by transferring psychological concepts (e.g., negotiation, cooperation) to HRI. Altogether, fifteen strategies were grouped by the expected affective outcome (positive, neutral, negative). In two online experiments, the acceptability of and compliance with these conflict resolution strategies were tested with humanoid and mechanic robots in two application contexts (public: n 1 = 61; private: n 2 = 93). To obtain a comparative value, the strategies were also applied by a human. As additional outcomes trust, fear, arousal, and valence, as well as perceived politeness of the agent were assessed. The positive/neutral strategies were found to be more acceptable and effective than negative strategies. Some negative strategies (i.e., threat, command) even led to reactance and fear. Some strategies were only positively evaluated and effective for certain agents (human or robot) or only acceptable in one of the two application contexts (i.e., approach, empathy). Influences on strategy acceptance and compliance in the public context could be found: acceptance was predicted by politeness and trust. Compliance was predicted by interpersonal power. Taken together, psychological conflict resolution strategies can be applied in HRI to enhance robot task effectiveness. If applied robot-specifically and context-sensitively they are accepted by the user. The contribution of this paper is twofold: conflict resolution strategies based on Human Factors and Social Psychology are introduced and empirically evaluated in two online studies for two application contexts. Influencing factors and requirements for the acceptance and effectiveness of robot assertiveness are discussed.","2020","2021-06-05 11:19:22","2021-06-05 11:19:22","","","","","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8946049324","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An important function of a robot is to find an optimal coverage path planning, with obstacle avoidance in dynamic environments for cleaning and monitoring robotics. This paper proposes a novel approach to enable robotic path planning. The proposed approach combines robot reasoning with knowledge reasoning techniques, hedge algebra, and the Spiral Spanning Tree Coverage (STC) algorithm, for a cleaning and monitoring robot with optimal decisions. This approach is used to apply knowledge inference and hedge algebra with the Spiral STC algorithm to enable autonomous robot control in the optimal coverage path planning, with minimum obstacle avoidance. The results of experiments show that the proposed approach in the optimal robot path planning avoids tangible and intangible obstacles for the monitoring and cleaning robot. Experimental results are compared with current methods under the same conditions. The proposed model using knowledge reasoning techniques in the optimal coverage path performs better than the conventional algorithms in terms of high robot coverage and low repetition rates.

The researchers aim to gather practical knowledge regarding tourists’ intentions for such service enhancements, which may drive the sector to adopt a better conclusive growth pattern in post-COVID-19 times. In this study, we attempt to focus on travelers who look for paramount safety with the assurance of empathetic, personalized care in post-COVID-19 times. In the current study, the authors employ structural equation modeling to evaluate the intentions of tourists both structurally and empirically for destination tourism with data collected from tourists with previous exposure to various kinds of these devices. The study shows that human-machine interactive devices are integrating AI and VR and have a significant effect on overall service quality, leading to tourist satisfaction and loyalty. The use of such social interactive gadgets within tourism and mostly in hospitality services requires an organization to make a commitment to futuristic technologies, along with building value by enriching service quality expectations among fearful tourists. This research shows that tourists mainly focus on the use of such HMI devices from the perspective of technology acceptance factors, qualitative value-enhancing service and trustworthy information-sharing mechanisms. The concept of the tour bubble framework is also discussed in detail. The analysis of this discussion gives us a more profound understanding of the novel opportunities which various administrative agencies may benefit from to position these devices better in smart, sustainable destination tourism strategies for the future so that, collectively, service 5.0 with HMI devices can possibly bring back tourism from being disintegrated. Such service applications are the new social innovations leading to sustainable service and a sophisticated experience for all tourists.","2020","2021-06-05 11:19:22","2021-06-05 11:19:22","","","","9523","12","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8864976461","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our approach is motivated by the notion that in many cultures, trust-building can be boosted by small body gestures. We discuss the integration of a robot capable of such movements within CRECA, our context-respectful counseling agent. The frequent nodding called “unazuki” in Japan, often accompanying the “un-un” sound (meaning “I agree”) of Japanese onomatopoeia, underlines empathy and embodies unconditioned approval. We argue that “unazuki” creates more empathy and promotes longer conversation between the robotic counsellor and people. We set up an experiment involving ten subjects to verify these effects. Our quantitative evaluation is based on the classic metrics of utterance, adapted to support the Japanese language. Interactions featuring “unazuki” showed higher value of this metrics. Moreover, subjects assessed the counselling robot’s trustworthiness and kindness as “very high” (Likert scale: 5.5 versus 3—4.5) showing the effect of social gestures in promoting empathetic dialogue to general people including the younger generation. Our findings support the importance of social movements when using robotized agents as a therapeutic tool aimed at improving emotional state and social interactions, with unambiguous evidence that embodiment can have a positive impact that warrants further exploration. The 3D printable design of our robot supports creating culture-specific libraries of social movements, adapting the gestural repertoire to different human cultures.","2020","2021-06-05 11:21:26","2021-06-05 11:21:26","","129-139","","3","6","","","Embodiment matters","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8644462671","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, selection in a great number of medical schools worldwide is still based on knowledge exams, a procedure that might neglect students with needed personal characteristics for future medical practice. We investigated whether the personal profile of students selected through a knowledge-based exam differed from those not selected. Methods: Students applying for medical school (N=311) completed questionnaires assessing motivations for becoming a doctor, learning approaches, personality traits, empathy, and coping styles. Selection was based on the results of MCQ tests. Principal component analysis was used to draw a profile of the students. Differences between selected and non-selected students were examined by Multivariate ANOVAs, and their impact on selection by logistic regression analysis. Results: Students demonstrating a profile of diligence with higher conscientiousness, deep learning approach, and task-focused coping were more frequently selected (p=0.01). Other personal characteristics such as motivation, sociability, and empathy did not significantly differ, comparing selected and non-selected students.

However, it is not known whether real-world altruists’ heightened empathy reflects true self-other mapping of multi-voxel neural response patterns. We investigated this relationship in adults who had engaged in extraordinarily costly real-world altruism: donating a kidney to a stranger. Altruists and controls completed fMRI testing while anticipating and experiencing pain, and watching as a stranger anticipated and experienced pain. Machine learning classifiers tested for shared representation between experienced and observed distress. Altruists exhibited more similar representations of experienced and observed fearful anticipation spontaneously and following an empathy prompt in anterior insula and anterior/middle cingulate cortex, respectively, suggesting heightened empathic proclivities and abilities for fear. During pain epochs, altruists were distinguished by spontaneous empathic responses in anterior insula, anterior/mid-cingulate cortex and supplementary motor area, but showed no difference from controls after the empathy prompt. These findings (1) link shared multi-voxel representations of the distress of self and others to real-world costly altruism, (2) reinforce distinctions between empathy for sensory states like pain and anticipatory affective states like fear, and (3) highlight the importance of differentiating between the proclivity and ability to empathize.","2019","2021-06-05 11:22:11","2021-06-05 11:22:11","","1-11","","1","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8207465742","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although the replacement of human counsellors remains a speculative prospect, chatbots for 'narrow AI' tasks (e.g., assessment and referral) are increasingly being used to augment clinical practice. Little research has addressed the possibilities for care that chatbots may generate in the future, particularly in the context of alcohol and other drug counselling. To explore these issues, we draw on the concept of technological 'affordances' and identify the range of possibilities for care that emerging chatbot interventions may afford and foreclose depending on the contexts in which they are implemented. Our analysis is based on qualitative data from interviews with clients (n=20) and focus group discussions with counsellors (n=8) conducted as part of a larger study of an Australian online alcohol and other drug counselling service. Both clients and counsellors expressed a concern that chatbot interventions lacked a 'human' element, which they valued in empathic care encounters. Most clients reported that they would share less information with a chatbot than a human counsellor, and they viewed this as constraining care. However, clients and counsellors suggested that the use of narrow AI might afford possibilities for performing discrete tasks, such as screening, triage or referral. In the context of what we refer to as 'more-than-human' care, our findings reveal complex views about the types of affordances that chatbots may produce and foreclose in online care encounters. We conclude by discussing implications for the potential 'addiction futures' and care trajectories that AI technologies offer, focussing on how they might inform alcohol and other drug policy, and the design of digital healthcare.","2020","2021-06-05 11:22:45","2021-06-05 11:22:45","","102910","","","2020","","","Enacting 'more-than-human' care","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8681360506","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Review of Philosophy and Psychology","","1878-5158","","","Abstract: Expanding the debate about empathy with human beings, animals, or fictional characters to include human-robot relationships, this paper proposes two different perspectives from which to assess the scope and limits of empathy with robots: the first is epistemological, while the second is normative. The epistemological approach helps us to clarify whether we can empathize with artificial intelligence or, more precisely, with social robots. The main puzzle here concerns, among other things, exactly what it is that we empathize with if robots do not have emotions or beliefs, since they do not have a consciousness in an elaborate sense. However, by comparing robots with fictional characters, the paper shows that we can still empathize with robots and that many of the existing accounts of empathy and mindreading are compatible with such a view. By so doing, the paper focuses on the significance of perspective-taking and claims that we also ascribe to robots something like a perspectival experience. The normative approach examines the moral impact of empathizing with robots. In this regard, the paper critically discusses three possible responses: strategic, anti-barbarizational, and pragmatist. The latter position is defended by stressing that we are increasingly compelled to interact with robots in a shared world and that to take robots into our moral consideration should be seen as an integral part of our self- and other-understanding.","2020","2021-06-05 11:22:45","2021-06-05 11:22:45","","881-897","","4","11","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 9022031224","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The assessment of our psychological traits is a useful tool when we require them to simulate empathy. Since the creation of social media platforms, numerous studies dealt with measuring personality traits by gathering users&#8217; information from their social media profiles. Real world applications showed how natural language processing combined with supervised machine learning algorithms are effective in this field. These applications have some limitations such as focusing on English text only and not considering polysemy in text. In this paper, we propose a multilingual model that handles polysemy by analyzing sentences as a semantic ensemble of interconnected words. The proposed approach processes <i>Facebook</i> posts from the <i>myPersonality</i> dataset and it turns them into a high-dimensional array of features, which are then exploited by a deep neural network architecture based on transformer to perform regression. We prove the effectiveness of our work by comparing the mean squared error of our model with existing baselines and the Kullback&#8722;Leibler divergence between the relative data distributions.

A humanoid mechanical technology is another difficult field. To co-work with people, humanoid robots not just need to include human like structure and structure, yet more significantly, they should arrange human like conduct with respect to the movement, correspondence and intelligence. In environmental factors where human exchange can't be conceivable to do a specific errand, the robots can do. Robots are used for lean industrial processes and have diversified their contributions to meeting lines inside the production international. The main focus of this project is to design and develop the mechanism for robotic arm for lifting. It is a type of mechanical arm, usually programmable, with similar functions to a human arm. The arm might be a unit system or might be an aspect of a more unpredictable mechanical cycle. The end effectors or mechanical hand can be intended to play out any ideal undertaking, for example, welding, holding, turning etc., depending on the application. The mechanical arm is planned and designed with four degrees of freedom and modified to achieve precisely basic light material lifting undertaking to aid the creation line in any industry. 3D printing strategy is utilized in this undertaking to create the parts of the automated arm. Hence, it gave more exact measurements and gigantic time and cost expensive in creation. The automated arm is furnished with 4 servo engines to interface the parts and bring arm development. A sequential construction mechanical system can improve its efficiency through developing the assembling pace and its consistency. They additionally spare individuals from dreary and tedious mechanical production system employments. Many industries are yet to implement such automation in their meeting traces, as they do no longer have the technical recognize how of the changeover, or the concern of failure of investment. It is proposed to layout and increase a low price assembly robotic which could overcome the above drawbacks. We have also included Design Thinking process before starting to do this experiment. The stages of Design Thinking such as Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype & test, Evolve are performed in the complete fabrication of the robotic arm. Many industries are yet to implement such automation in their assembly lines, as they do not have the technical knowhow of the changeover, or the fear of failure of investment. To proceed in this direction, a case study was conducted at a phase selector switch making company. Presently the company does manual assembly of the switches, which is a hindrance to the growth of the company. This process required a pilot study to explore the possibility as well as the implementations issues of robots in the assembly. The present system uses a belt conveyor system which has no feedback signals and the speed of the conveyor is not synchronized with the rate of assembly. It is generally not advised to transfer small size components in a conveyor since picking, orienting and inserting the components will be cumbersome. When the size of the component is considerably small, manual assembly is not recommended as per the guidelines of DFMA (Design for manufacture and assembly). Manual error is more prone to assembly of the part in a wrong orientation, especially for those components that are symmetrical. The parts to be assembled are both axi-symmetric as well as prismatic in shape. Constraints in loading and unloading of casing were also reported. In this work, the design and development of a low cost assembly robot is done which can overcome the above drawbacks.","2021","2021-06-05 11:22:45","2021-06-05 11:22:45","","","","1","1059","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8916214816","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Still, explanations as to why slightly imperfect human-like characters can evoke feelings of eeriness remain the subject of controversy. Many experiments exploring the phenomenon have emphasized specific visual factors in connection to evolutionary psychological theories or an underlying categorization conflict. More recently, studies have also shifted away focus from the appearance of human-like entities, instead exploring their mental capabilities as basis for observers' discomfort. In order to advance this perspective, we introduced 92 participants to a virtual reality (VR) chat program and presented them with two digital characters engaged in an emotional and empathic dialogue. Using the same pre-recorded 3D scene, we manipulated the perceived control type of the depicted characters (human-controlled avatars vs. computer-controlled agents), as well as their alleged level of autonomy (scripted vs. self-directed actions). Statistical analyses revealed that participants experienced significantly stronger eeriness if they perceived the empathic characters to be autonomous artificial intelligences. As human likeness and attractiveness ratings did not result in significant group differences, we present our results as evidence for an “uncanny valley of mind“ that relies on the attribution of emotions and social cognition to non-human entities. A possible relationship to the philosophy of anthropocentrism and its “threat to human distinctiveness” concept is discussed.","2017","2021-06-05 11:22:45","2021-06-05 11:22:45","","43-50","","","160","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 6948567162","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

ICUs will need to adapt to increased demand for services and concomitant economic pressures with efficiency and innovation. The future ICU will see changes in form, function, personnel and patients. The type of patients in ICUs and their medical conditions will be different. Prevention, early detection, and timely treatment of conditions such as infection and respiratory failure should decrease the need for many ICU admissions. Patients needing ICU care will have multiple complex problems that shift the epidemiology of critical care. This shift in patient populations will not change the need for compassionate and empathetic care. Precision medicine for patient care is the goal of the future ICU—tailoring therapy for conditions based on individual characteristics, risk profile or genetic markers1. Protocols and guidelines will require the ability to adapt to defined patient groups. The physical ICU environment of the future must promote a healing environment for patients, families, visitors and ICU staff2. Optimal design should reduce noise, maximize work efficiency, minimize potential for errors, decrease infection risk, reduce stress and provide comfort for families and visitors. The environment will address sound, light, temperature, smell, art and entertainment needs. The ICU of the future must be a flexible environment with builtin adaptability for technological advances. Cohorting of critically ill patients in a defined ICU area will continue for efficiency but the flexibility to deliver critical care outside the physical ICU must also be provided. Patientcentered care will continue to drive services in the future. The ICU of the future continues to require a highly trained collaborative team of professionals but roles and responsibilities as well as composition of the team will change. Intensivists will still oversee these teams but advanced practice providers and nonintensivist physicians may play greater roles in direct patient care. Greater emphasis will be placed on preventing burn out in team members through use of smart technology, optimum work environment and professional support. Technology will be the most constantly changing variable in future ICUs that will affect the environment, patients, and staff. Sophisticated informatics will interface all hospital systems with the ICU and advance individualized care3. These systems must have characteristics of association, interoperability, integration, security, safety, and realtime synchronization4. Artificial intelligence and learning will address the challenges of information overload and integration of data to enable optimum decision making. Electronic “sniffers” will detect and interpret changes in patients’ clinical status and send alerts to clinicians or potentially initiate interventions. In addition, alarm systems will screen out irrelevant signals and decrease the danger of “alarm fatigue” but at the same time provide early alerts to safety issues and provide suggested actions. An outgrowth of advances in information technology will be the use of “big data” to optimize immediate patient care as well as advance research in the ICU5.","2019","2021-06-05 11:23:13","2021-06-05 11:23:13","","1-2","","2","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8839018314","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An exploration of the acceptance and desire of teens to interact with avatars and virtual agents for self-management and behavioral modification was undertaken. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The utilized approach was inspired by community-based participatory research. Data was collected from 2 phases: Phase 1) focus groups with teens, provider interviews, parent interviews; and Phase 2) mid-range prototype assessment by teens and providers. RESULTS: Data from all stakeholder groups expressed great interest in avatars and virtual agents assisting self-management efforts. Adolescents felt the avatars and virtual agents could: 1) reinforce guidance and support, 2) fit within their lifestyle, and 3) help set future goals, particularly after witnessing the effect of their current behavior(s) on the projected physical appearance (external and internal organs) of avatars. Teens wanted 2 virtual characters: a virtual agent to act as a coach or teacher and an avatar (extension of themselves) to serve as a ""buddy"" for empathic support and guidance and as a surrogate for rewards. Preferred modalities for use include both mobile devices to accommodate access and desktop to accommodate preferences for maximum screen real estate to support virtualization of functions that are more contemplative and complex (e.g., goal setting). Adolescents expressed a desire for limited co-user access, which they could regulate. Data revealed certain barriers and facilitators that could affect adoption and use. DISCUSSION: The current study extends the support of teens, parents, and providers for adding avatars or virtual agents to traditional computer-based interactions. Data supports the desire for a personal relationship with a virtual character in support of previous studies. The study provides a foundation for further work in the area of avatar-driven motivational interviewing. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence supporting the use of avatars and virtual agents, designed using participatory approaches, to be included in the continuum of care.

"H8MQPYDC","journalArticle","2018","Jane Taylor","On Uncertainty","Kronos","","2309-9585","","","On Uncertainty  Jane TaylorCentre for Humanities Research, University of the Western Cape  PreambleThere is some uncertainty written into the form of this paper because, while it seeks to use scholarly procedures in engaging with the philosophical questions provoked by Ludwig Wittgenstein's late speculative essay On Certainty,1it arose out of my research toward a theatrical interpretation of that work. The article is an attempt to stage the mode of thought, as well as the state of mind, of this most complex thinker in his last years. My thoughts pay particular attention to philosophical traditions, while considering dramatic forms, spatial meanings, constellations of persons, histories, ideas, events, and designs.Moreover, I am locating the text in the context of the workshop, 'Missing and Missed: The Subject, Politics and Memorialisation of South Africa's Colonial and Apartheid Dead' at which it was presented in early 2018. The workshop generated papers and conversations enquiring into the grief, abjection, rage, and discouragement that have marked so much of the violent histories of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, and their legacies of colonialism, genocide, and geographic dislocation. The anguish of these materials requires a certain gravitas, and there might seem some waywardness in my exploring the arcane philosophical thought of a young man born into staggering wealth and privilege in Europe at the end of the nineteenth century. Nonetheless, it seems to me that Wittgenstein made a compelling and genuinely traumatised attempt to use intellectual means to come to terms with the precarious-ness and uncertainty of life in the twentieth century. The depth of his enquiry is read in the following pages alongside some of the details of his 'family romance'.2I am aware that Wittgenstein's writings have been grouped into two distinct modes: his early work is conceived within the frame of picture theory, and his later writings seek to interpret the world in terms of language games. In both, his thought marked him as an outsider to his own traditions. On thinking about the 'Missing and Missed', I was prompted to reconsider his rather uncanny meditations, his sense of the enigmatic, and magical thinking. How might these have arisen from within the philosophy and within his life? Here, I invoke his observations about how we inhabit presence and absence within representation and language.While not seeking to engage in a 'Wittgensteinian reading' (were such a thing were possible), nor undertaking a biographical reading of the philosopher,3 I am trying to imagine what skeins of interpretation and suggestion might be integral to a process of staging Wittgenstein's thought, although not wholly on its own terms. Recent dramatic theory has suggested that the uncanny is necessarily the effect inside one's experience of a dramatic performance, because everything within the theatrical arts has an explicit doubling. Things and persons are simultaneously themselves and a something else. A desk might stand for a policeman's office while it is onstage, yet it may also recognisably be the desk used at a local high school. Moreover there is a complex temporality onstage, which conjures an exquisite presence and absence,4in that every event is based on the actors' 'taking for granted' that everything will, tomorrow at this point in the action, be exactly the same.5 That event will mimic this one; and yet, each time it is performed, it is unique to itself - with all of the codes and conventions of cause and effect known, and yet 'as if for the first time'. This is not bad faith; rather it has come to be referred to as 'the suspension of disbelief', and I am inclined to consider Wittgenstein's thoughts about 'certainty' as operating in a similar mode.Questions about creativity and scholarly service have implications for research and for interpretation. I am interested intellectually in putting some pressure on both modes. At some level, I am asking a Janus-faced question that looks in two directions at once: to what extent is creative exploration of a historical figure legitimate (even necessary) in attempts to apprehend the person and the experience of that figure; and in what ways is the archive a constraint on the creative purposes of the interpreter? (The Wittgenstein archive includes a very diverse body of writings: an extensive biography; secondhand interpretations that amount, at times, to hagiography; profound philosophical debate within linguistics and philosophy; a cinematic poem;6 and a film7). Put differently, my question is, how do scholarly and creative endeavours agitate one another, and what is the potential gain from this?Wittgenstein's writing is notoriously complex and difficult to apprehend. I am not considering his entire oeuvre. My intentions are very circumscribed. I am seeking to draw some meaning from one of his last papers in order to make a theatre work that might illuminate some spheres within his writing. While I am thinking with and about Wittgenstein's essay, this paper is not a script for that theatrical piece. Rather, this is some of the background research towards the making of that work.That is, in this paper, I consider the relationship between research and the varieties of interpretation. The proofs, arguments or evidence I have selected are of a particular mode. They make available a kind of argument arising from the conjunction of Wittgenstein's own psychosexual being with the geopolitical context of his lifeworld and the decidedly individual (if not eccentric) mode of his writing. These considerations are both methodological and theoretical. I am also exploring how ideas can provide the substance of what happens onstage in a performance event.8There are several ways of knowing and of representation, the varieties of which arise most productively, it seems to me, through interpretations that lie on a cusp between the scholarly and the creative. This may be because the archive is inevitably fragmentary or inadequately tested. In postcolonial studies, that archive is substantially asymmetrical, with an obvious bias toward written records. This frequently results in the detailed presence of the colonial voice, and only a conjectural presence of the colonised, who may (at best) be figured through the ventriloquisms of colonial administrators or ethnographic observers. In such cases, what amounts to a 'counter-historical' set of hermeneutic procedures becomes fruitful. This is where I am interested in what the arts make available, supplementing what is missing in an informed and substantial way.Wittgenstein wrote notes for the essay On Certainty shortly before his death. What strikes me as provocative and generative about them are the ways in which the philosopher posits that our assurances of the world are sustained more through that which we do not examine than that which we test. Some resonance between this and an Althusserian understanding of ideology seems to occur, although it is hard to imagine a more incongruous pairing of thinkers.9As one of the richest families in Europe at the start of the twentieth century, the Wittgensteins provide a narrative of catastrophe that is somehow symptomatic of an era. I: On the one handIt is World War I. Three brothers are engaged on the Eastern Front. The young men are not fighting side by side, as one might imagine. Rather, each of them is, we may say, in a different battle zone, each in his own war, though they are all fighting on the side of the Habsburgs. Sons of one of the richest houses of Vienna, their saga becomes significant for history because the youngest of the three is Ludwig Wittgenstein, who becomes one of the twentieth century's most influential philosophers.Here, I give a brief account of the three brothers, and their encounters with the war.Let me begin with the eldest of the three. In October 1918, just weeks before the war ended, Kurt shot and killed himself after the soldiers under his command refused to obey his orders. It seems that his troops, who were largely made up of Czechs, Poles, Croats and Hungarians, no longer saw themselves as members of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and instead had begun to identify with the emerging fragmentary states that had already been given autonomy by the emperor. Disinclined to fight for the Habsburgs any longer, the soldiers began to wander off towards their homelands, abandoning Kurt and their station, as the imperial state began to disintegrate.Suicide was the route of least humiliation for their commanding officer.10 Such was Kurt's fate. He was also the third of Ludwig's brothers to commit suicide; two others had died some years before, while Ludwig was just a boy.The second brother on the Eastern Front is Paul. His story raises many questions of theatrical interest for me, and several of my performance questions arise from his story. Paul was conscripted early in the war, and, in August 1914, during the Austrian assault on Poland, he was captured by Russian troops. In the skirmish, he was shot in the right arm, and lost consciousness. On coming round, he discovered that his arm had been amputated. This would be a grim catastrophe for any of us, but for Paul Wittgenstein, it was distinctly so because he was a concert pianist of some ambition.His musical ambition was surely part of the family burden. The Wittgensteins were all distinctly oriented toward music: the household had seven grand pianos; Hans, the first-born son, and the first to commit suicide, had been considered a musical prodigy; Ludwig could whistle entire movements from several well-known symphonies; Brahms, Mahler, and Richard Strauss were only the most famous of the many musicians to regularly visit the Wittgenstein household; and musical criticism was part of the family ethos. Paul is reported as having wailed at Ludwig, 'I cannot play the piano when you are in the house as I feel your skepticism seeping towards me from under the door.'11Music is surely a major element of the staging of the piece.The wounded, one-armed Paul was imprisoned for some time in the dread Siberian fortress where Dostoyevsky set his novel, The House of the Dead, and here he had to begin to reckon with the fact of his missing limb. It must have been a kind of therapeutic mania that drove him to set himself the task of re-arranging conventional piano pieces for the left hand, using a makeshift drawing of a keyboard on a crate to think through the placement of fingers on notes. On this 'virtual' piano, he perfected complex fingering, using only his left hand to create the aural illusion of two-handed playing. Paul engaged in this drill for up to seven hours a day, and in this process he began to arrange Chopin's Revolutionary Étude for the left hand.12Paul Wittgenstein's transcription of the Chopin work may well have been influenced by the fact that Leopold Godowsky had set several arrangements of Chopin's etudes for the left hand. Godowsky is cited as among the greatest classical pianists in history; it is likely that his left-handed transcriptions were composed in part just because he could play them, and they served as a kind of technical challenge for him. His arrangements are renowned for their technical difficulty and have been called the most impossibly difficult things ever written for the piano.13 According to some, 'Godowsky was probably unequalled in independence of hands, equality of finger, and his ability to delineate polyphonic strands' while fellow virtuoso pianist and composer Vladimir Horowitz apparently claimed that six hands are needed to play his Passacaglia.14Although some recordings exist, very few people ever saw Godowsky play - he could not bear performing in public.There is some suggestion that Paul Wittgenstein would have known of Godowsky's arrangements, and that they spurred him to arrange his own version of Chopin's Revolutionary Étude. Of course, the textures of war, so brilliantly evoked by Chopin, may also have influenced this choice. Chopin's work is a distraught aural response to Poland's failed November Uprising against Russia in 1830 and 1831, and is likely to have had emotional magnitude for a young man who had lost an arm fighting on the Russian Front. Chopin dedicated the piece to his friend Franz Liszt, who (interestingly) had trained the gifted left-handed pianist Géza Zichy. Zichy lost a hand in a shooting accident as a youth.15 The work would have resonated with Paul for any number of reasons.The reader might watch a fragment of this astonishing work, which was composed as Chopin's meditation on the bombardment of Warsaw. Its performance makes us attentive to what the left hand is doing in the playing of the piece. Some performances of the Godowsky left-handed arrangement are available on YouTube, and they are striking to watch and hear by comparison.16 II: Philosophy's response; and psychology's tooLet me turn now to the youngest of the three brothers, the philosopher Ludwig. Before the war, from 1911, Ludwig had been in Cambridge, studying philosophy with Bertrand Russell. When the war broke out in July 1914, Ludwig was with his family in Austria, and tried to leave for Norway. On being prevented from doing so, he volunteered for civilian duties, and by August, he had signed up for military service in the Austro-Hungarian army. Back in Cambridge, Russell, who was an earnest pacifist, opposed conscription. Following his conviction for pacifism under the Defence of the Realm Act of 1914, Russell was dismissed from the university and sent to prison for the rest of the war, and later described these experiences in 1922 in his Free Thought and Official Propaganda. It was surely something of a puzzle for Russell when Ludwig, his protégé and someone he admired with an almost total adoration, signed up to fight for Austria.While Ludwig was manning an anti-aircraft searchlight on a gunboat near Krakow, his diaries record that he was reading Nietzsche's, The Anti-Christ. Promoted to the rank of lieutenant, Ludwig was sent to the Italian Front, where he was captured. He spent the end of the war as a prisoner, apparently writing notes for his early major work, Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus - a work pretty well unlike anything else in the Western tradition. Wittgenstein's writing is notoriously idiosyncratic, often more like poetry than philosophy. His work has disquieted generations of readers, largely because his enigmatic forms and unlikely idioms do not adhere to known philosophical procedures. Alain Badiou classified him as an anti-philosopher, along with Nietzsche, Lacan and St Paul.17Meanwhile, in England, Ludwig's beloved companion, David Hume Pinsent had gone to Farnborough to train as a test pilot. In 1918, a biplane bomber he was flying spontaneously ripped into five pieces, killing Pinsent and his co-pilot. No trace of Pinsent's body was ever recovered, despite a (presumably extensive) search by 1200 soldiers that included the dragging of a canal. Wittgenstein was desolate at the death, and, three years later, dedicated his Tractatus to Pinsent.18Wittgenstein's Tractatus swerves between contesting idioms to denote representation, activating the terms vorstellen, dastellen and abbilden in different instances. Wittgenstein also uses the term bedeuten (to mean, to stand for, to signify) for the ways in which a name refers to an object and for the way in which philosophy obliquely indicates the unsayable.19 Wittgenstein's work is irresistibly metaphysical in many of its guises.20 Wittgenstein also demonstrates a quite extraordinary apprehension of the complex ordering of worlds that are simultaneously active. He notes, for example, that 'the description of a wish is ... the description of its fulfilment.' This suggests that the material world and its representations are mutually 'entangled'. Here I allude expressly to that term as invoked by the title of this special edition 'Missing and Missed'. I also acknowledge that the concept of 'entanglement' emerged from within a philosophical tradition associated with quantum theory and the uncertainty principle.In 1939, when the Cambridge philosopher G. E. Moore set out to refute real-world scepticism (that is, doubt about the substantial reality of a knowable material world), he held up his one hand while asserting the premise that: 'Here is a hand'. He then raised his other hand stating, 'and here is another'. With this demonstration, he believed himself to have shown that the world is not mind-dependent.21 Over several years, Wittgenstein, also at Cambridge, had engaged in fierce discussion with Moore - who was a long-standing interlocutor - although Wittgenstein's comments on Moore might suggest that they were antagonists in an archaic agon. For example, Wittgenstein said of Moore, 'he shows you how far a man can go who has absolutely no intelligence whatsoever.'22 I suspect this was a measure of Wittgenstein's regard -Moore was so close to Wittgenstein in his question, that Wittgenstein could not bear that they were so far apart in method.23Moore's well-known observations on the hand were clearly in Wittgenstein's mind when, late in his career, he wrote his last work, On Certainty. As if in direct response, Wittgenstein's essay begins, 'If you do know that here is one hand, we'll grant you all the rest.'24 Which he then qualifies with the enigmatic 'From its seeming to me - or to everyone - to be so, it doesn't follow that it is so.' For Wittgenstein 'seeming' and 'knowing' are different orders of thought. In his terms, 'Knowledge' and 'certainty' belong to different categories.25This speculative reasoning opens the way for profound instability about verifiable fact, in terms such as had been posited in physics by the uncertainty principle.What is more, the emerging practice of prosthetics, which became well-established as a result of the ghastly injuries of World War II, began to alter the stock Cartesian assurances about the threshold of the physical self. Sigmund Freud developed the prosthesis into a figure that could act as a support for an idealisation of a fragmented self.Long ago [man] formed an ideal conception of omnipotence and omniscience which he embodied in his gods. To these gods he attributed everything that seemed unattainable to his wishes, or that was forbidden to him. One may say, therefore, that these gods were cultural ideals. Today he has come very close to the attainment of this ideal, he has almost become a god himself. Only, it is true, in the fashion in which ideals are usually attained according to the general judgment of humanity: not completely, in some respects not at all, in others only half way. Man has, as it were, become a kind of prosthetic God. When he puts on all his auxiliary organs he is truly magnificent; but those organs have not grown on to him and they still give him much trouble at times ... Future ages will bring with them new and probably unimaginably great achievements in this field of civilization and will increase man's likeness to God still more. But in the interests of our investigations, we will not forget that present-day man does not feel happy in his Godlike character.26Freud is suggesting that the human subject has found the means through which to strap on psychical prostheses that can console her for perceived lacks, to mask or erase that which is missing. This is an abstract elaboration of an idea that Freud had been considering since the last years of World War I.We are not in the habit of devoting much thought to the fact that every night human beings lay aside the wrappings in which they have enveloped their skin, as well as anything which they may use as a supplement to their bodily organs (so far as they have succeeded in making good those organs' deficiencies by substitutes), for instance, their spectacles, their false hair, and teeth and so on.27The horizons of personhood are, by convention and common-sense experience, associated with the skin, which is its threshold. Of course, that assertion understates the force of sensory information that penetrates us, in an endless riot of aural, visual, and olfactory information, and sensory thrills or revulsions from outside, which strike us to the core.Freud's theory was profoundly influenced by his proximity to the war and its wounded. In Part II of his influential essay, Beyond the Pleasure Principle,28he describes what he calls, 'traumatic neurosis', which he identifies as arising from sudden disaster, such as a railway accident, or the terrible war, which had just ended. He was seeking to interpret the increasingly prevalent phenomenon that has subsequently been identified as 'shell shock', noting 'that the same symptoms sometimes came about without the intervention of any gross mechanical force.'29 In other words, a subject might experience the trauma of a disabling physical catastrophe without any manifest physical wound or disability. One might in such cases suggest that even the 'originating episode' is missing.The first are images of early facial prostheses from World War I (Figures 1 & 2) used to conceal shattered bone and flesh; the second is an image (Figure 3) of the oral prostheses that Freud had to wear, once cancer had begun eating away the inside of his mouth. Only his daughter Anna was allowed to help him with the grim task of managing these.Wittgenstein's On Certainty is a curious work, in which the philosopher distinguishes between 'facts' we know, but that can and must be subjected to verification and testing, and things of which we are certain. The certainties are such propositions for which the principle of testing makes no sense. As noted, the unsettling opening sentence of this text is, 'If you do know that here is one hand, we'll grant you all the rest.' He follows this up with, '§9. Now do I, in the course of my life, make sure I know that here is a hand - my own hand, that is?' If any readers are prompted to read On Certainty, they will be astonished to discover how often the philosopher returns to the hand as his exemplary question:§23: If I don't know whether someone has two hands (say, whether they have been amputated or not) I shall believe his assurance that he has two hands, if he is trustworthy.§24: The idealist's question would be something like: 'What right have I not to doubt the existence of my hands?'§40: Upon 'I know that here is my hand' there may follow the question 'How do you know?' And the answer to that presupposes that this can be known in that way. So instead of 'I know that here is my hand,' one might say 'Here is my hand', and then add how one knows.§41: 'I know where I am feeling pain,' 'I know that I feel it here is as wrong as 'I know that I am in pain.' But 'I know where you touched my arm' is right. III: Of lossWittgenstein's early great love, David Hume Pinsent, was a descendant of the Scottish philosopher David Hume, after whom he was named. The philosopher Hume suggested that there is only an internal claim to external reality, asking: 'What causes induce us to believe in the existence of body?' He also questioned, 'why we attribute a continu'd existence to objects, even when they are not present to the senses?'30These are very much the sort of questions addressed by Wittgenstein. Perhaps these Humean questions were discussed by the two men before David disappeared, literally without trace?After the war, Paul Wittgenstein, for whom 'money was no object', commissioned a spectrum of his era's great composers to write works for the left-handed piano player. Korngold is the first; then Ravel, Prokofiev, Hindemith, Britten, and Strauss all receive commissions. Generally, Paul was unhappy with the compositions, and his dialogues with the composers were often fractious. Somehow it seems, the compositions revealed too much and not enough that the works were for a one-handed player. Here the significance of 'passing' is worth consideration. Paul Wittgenstein is in all likelihood named after St Paul - the most famous converso in Western history, and one of Badiou's anti-philosophers.What's in a name? The grandfather, Hermann Christian Wittgenstein had converted from Judaism to Catholicism. One might be tempted to ask why their father, a man with Jewish ancestry whose family had assimilated through marriage into Viennese aristocracy, would manifest a conspicuous trace, in his son's name. By naming his son Paul - after a Jew, who was also a Roman citizen, and who spent his early career as a persecutor of Christians but later became a patriarch of the Christian church - he seems to declare that his family is 'passing'.Chapter 9 of the Book of Acts in the New Testament provides an account of Saul's conversion. He is on the road to Damascus when he is thrown to the ground by a burst of sunlight, and a great voice demands to know, 'Why persecutest thou me?'We must imagine - Paul is rendered helpless, blind, and effectively without sensory stimulus. We are told that he neither ate nor drank during this traumatic period. When he finally comes back to 'himself', so to speak, he was no longer himself. He had become his enemy. Paul became the rock upon which the Christian Church was founded, declaring that henceforth there was neither Greek nor Jew, and asserting that circumcision of the flesh should cease in favour of circumcision in the soul.By the mid 1930s, Paul Wittgenstein had become a one-armed pianist who could no longer move freely through his beloved Vienna because of the signs declaiming Juden verboten. At first, he tried to get assurances that the family would, as good assimilated citizens, be treated as Aryans; Paul was astonished to discover that this was not the case. 'We count as Jews!' was his cry, on reading the Nazi legislation on genealogy and race.31 He then antagonised several family members by trying to negotiate with the Nazis, and offering to pay for the family's status to be 'reassigned'.Paul ultimately fled to New York at the start of the Anschluss in 1938. Decades later, one of his former students, Erna Otten, wrote to neurologist Oliver Sacks about her youthful encounter with her piano teacher. We are reminded again of the extraordinary entanglement of mind and flesh through her recollections:As a very young student of the Viennese pianist Paul Wittgenstein ... I had many occasions to see how involved his right stump was whenever we went over the fingering for a new composition.He told me many times that I should trust his choice of fingering because he felt every finger of his right hand. At times I had to sit very quietly while he would close his eyes and his stump would move constantly in an agitated manner. This was many years after the loss of his arm.32It is striking that Paul, from so wealthy a family, did not avail himself of the latest technologies in prosthetics development. Photographs show his empty right sleeve tucked neatly into the right-hand pocket of his jacket.However, a search for information on Paul Wittgenstein on the internet discloses that his legacy lives on in the numerous compositions he commissioned for the one-handed player. We can effectively consider these works to be Paul's prosthesis. It is worth considering why he seems to have found fault with all the compositions that were intended to relaunch his career as a concert pianist. If we acknowledge that a prosthesis is a reminder of loss as much as it is a substitution, we might ask, are the compositions too obviously or not sufficiently evidently, created for the one-handed player? Paul certainly strove to be a piano player, rather than a one-handed pianist. There is a vexing ambiguity implicit in this. Each composition must fail because it could not return the missing arm. No matter how deft the composition, it would fail to repair an irrecoverable loss. Was Paul trying to locate a composition through which he might 'pass' for a two-handed pianist?As we know, Freud's meditations in Beyond the Pleasure Principle prompted a series of subsequent considerations on the phantasmic, the symptom, and trauma. Recent research involving 'mirror neurons' demonstrates that the mind can be persuaded of what it does not want to know. In some cases, individuals who experience persistent pain in a phantom limb (a limb lost in some kind of catastrophic event) can be meaningfully treated if they view their remaining limb in a mirror, and see it respond to treatment as if it were the phantom one. For example, seeing the remaining hand relaxing can fool the mind into unclenching a phantom fist that has been frozen in a rictus for several years. Enigmatically, the brain can relearn what it knows to be true. The same research suggests that mirror neurons in the premotor complex might also be responsible for empathy. Thus, when I observe a behaviour, I can form a mental picture of that behaviour in my mind, and place myself in the position of the other.33An interesting set of considerations has come to my attention through studying left-handed concerto compositions. Many of the pianists who play such compositions are two-handed. They undertake the performances as virtuosic displays and expressive interpretations. A few perform Godowsky's left-handed Studies on Chopin's Etudes as part of their standard repertoire - demonstrating left-handed dexterity, a left-handed (or sinister) right-handedness. Another group of pianists who engage with these compositions have both hands but are functionally left-handed. They are afflicted with focal dystonia, a neurological condition caused by the 'misfiring' of neurons in the sensorimotor cortex, the layer of neural tissue covering the brain. In such cases, prolonged use of the left hand in and practice and performance creates a distorted 'map' of the hand in the brain.How do these emerging neurological models of the mind, with their metaphorical 'maps' of the hand in the sensorimotor cortex, take us back to the dualistic riddles of early modernity? What is the hand at the end of my arm, and how does it relate to the hand in my mind? 34 IV: Certain uncertaintyYou will recall that Ludwig's brother, Kurt, killed himself while serving as an officer in the war, and that he was the third of the three older Wittgenstein brothers to do so. Hans (the musical prodigy) and Rudi, had preceded their sibling in acts of self-extinction. In 1902, Hans fled to America and seems to have drowned himself in Chesapeake Bay. Two years later, Rudi walked into his favourite bar in Vienna, ordered a glass of milk, laced it with cyanide and swallowed it. In the days leading up to this, he reportedly sought help from the Scientific-Humanitarian Committee, led by Dr Magnus Hirschfeld, which was campaigning against Paragraph 175 of the German Criminal Code, which prohibited homosexual sex. It seems Rudi was terrified that he might be identifiable, and therefore inadvertently exposed, as a subject of Hirschfeld's research. After Rudi's death, his father forbade the family to ever mention his name.These events were observed by, and became part of Ludwig, the youngest of the children, heir to his share of the family fortune, and to his share of the family curse. No wonder he renounced his inheritance. The whole grim saga has the brooding sense of the inevitable that we know from Greek dramatic form.Ludwig had observed the suicide of three brothers, each of whom would in turn have been a lost continent in the familial atlas; he observed too, the reparations ongoing in his brother Paul, the pianist who lost his right arm. When I read On Certainty, I am struck by some of the melancholy speculations about the unverifiability of observed events; it is haunted work. For example:§90. 'I know' has a primitive meaning similar to and related to 'I see' ('wissen', 'videre'). And 'I knew he was in the room, but he wasn't in the room' is like 'I saw him in the room, but he wasn't there.' 'I know' is supposed to express a relation, not between me and the sense of a proposition (like 'I believe') but between me and a fact. So that the fact is taken into my consciousness. (Here is the reason why one wants to say that nothing that goes on in the outer world is really known, but only what happens in the domain of what are called sense-data.)In a notebook from 1917, Wittgenstein writes of Dostoyevsky: 'If suicide is allowed, then everything is allowed. If anything is not allowed, then suicide is not allowed.' This from a man who has seen three of his four brothers perish at their own hands. Badiou considers this as an instance of Wittgensteinian 'confessional writing'.35I think of it as a kind of 'catastrophic writing', grounded in autobiographical fact yet also working to shift philosophical thought.In my final observations I would like to return briefly to the idea of 'passing' which I referred to in relation to the converso, and Paul's lost arm. In 'On Certainty Wittgenstein notes:§79. That I am a man and not a woman can be verified, but if I were to say I was a woman, and then tried to explain the error by saying I hadn't checked the statement, the explanation would not be accepted.These rather enigmatic meditations call to mind the Turing Test, in which Alan Turing, the British mathematical genius responsible for breaking the codes created by the Nazi Enigma machine, sought a way of identifying human from artificial intelligence. He posits a version of the Imitation Game, an old parlour game in which a man (player A) and a woman (player B) are positioned in separate rooms, each with a typewriter. In the original version, they are asked a series of questions, and both try to convince their audience that each is the other. In Turing's version, player A is a machine, and the interrogator has to work out which player is the machine. The paper was published in Mind in 1950.In 1939, Turing had attended Wittgenstein's Lectures on the Foundations of Mathematics. From the archive of these events,36 the two men disagreed on a fundamental question. Wittgenstein was in favour of tolerating contradiction within mathematics; Turing argued against it, positing that the toleration of a contradiction would, in application, lead to the collapse of bridges.Turing died of cyanide poisoning in 1954; in 1952, he had been convicted of acts of gross indecency and sodomy.The human subject has always testified to the arbitrary character of loss. Our geniuses give complex accounts of our grief and our resilience in the face of frailty and mortality. Wittgenstein's essay On Certainty can be interpreted as the twentieth century's philosophical 'coming to terms' with a necessary and sustaining suspension of disbelief that grounds the everyday, despite our ever-increasing sense of our own precarity.  1 L. Wittgenstein, On Certainty, 1969, G. E. M. Anscombe and G. H. Wright (eds), Denis Paul and G. E. M. Anscombe (trans.), (Oxford: Blackwell, 1975). 2 I mean 'family romance' in the Freudian sense, to allude to the psychic drama of the unfolding of the self inside the nuclear family. Wittgenstein's complex relation to Freud is well documented. On one hand, he was a keen advocate of his Viennese compatriot. This did not prevent him from levelling a clear critique at the Freudian method at times. A striking instance of this can be found in a posthumous collection of his letters, essays and reflections, Culture and Value, G. H. Von Wright (ed.), (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1980). Wittgenstein writes, 'What is intriguing about a dream is not its causal connection with events in my life, etc., but rather the impression it gives of being a fragment of a story ... the rest of which remains obscure' (p. 68e). Here the typical Wittgensteinian appeal to obscurity is linked to fragmentation. This is significant as an insight into ideas I am exploring around the haunting of that which is 'missing' in Wittgenstein's thought and experience. 3 There are several such. I recommend two in particular: R. Monk, Wittgenstein: The Duty of Genius (London: Vintage, 1991) and Alexander Waugh,         [ Links ] The House of Wittgenstein: A Family at War (New York: Anchor, 2009).         [ Links ] 4 Freddie Rokem, Samuel Weber, and Marvin Carlson have all written on various aspects of these questions. 5 In the past several decades, this convention of iterability has been challenged by performance art, which sets itself apart from acting largely around the conception that each performance is a one-off; the classic text on this question is still, R. Goldberg, Performance Art: From Futurism to the Present, 3rd ed. (New York: Thames & Hudson, 2011).         [ Links ] 6 This fascinating 1992 response to Wittgenstein's Tractatus by Péter Forgács, is available on YouTube. 7 The credits for the 1993 film Wittgenstein give an indication of how much is at stake in any engagement with Wittgenstein: the film was directed by Derek Jarman, scripted by Jarman, Terry Eagleton and Ken Butler, and produced by Tariq Ali. 8 Here, I am aware that I am straying into complex terrain, already very thoughtfully considered by D. LaCapra. In 'Review: Reading Exemplars: Wittgensteins Vienna and Wittgenstein's Tractatus, Diacritics, 9, 2, Summer 1979, 65-82, LaCapra analyses questions that arise through two discrepant readings of Wittgenstein. One is grounded in a close reading of the philosopher's own puzzling and occasionally luminous thinking - often marked by enigmas; the other is a bio-political reading of Wittgenstein as he might be 'understood' through his relationship to fin-de-siècle Vienna. LaCapra's point is that the courage of the philosophy in the Tractatus is that it stands as a testimony to contradictions and unresolved questioning, while Allan Janik and Stephen Toulmin's book, Wittgenstein's Vienna, seems to resolve and explain these issues by locating them within his milieu. 9 It is perhaps no more than a curious accident that the two works were written within a year of one another. For Althusser, this would constitute a political question, while for Wittgenstein it would be a philosophical one, although each would no doubt ('certainly') have an apparatus for interpreting one another's instruments. 10 Various interpretations of the motivations for Kurt's death are outlined in Waugh's House of Wittgenstein. Monk's biography notes simply that Kurt 'shot himself when the troops under his command had refused to obey orders' Duty of Genius, 11. His footnotes do not indicate his source. This account is one that strikes me as compelling. 11 These biographical elements are largely derived from Monk, Duty of Genius. The considerations about Paul Wittgenstein are informed, too, by B. Howe, 'Wittgenstein and the Performance of Disability,' Journal of Musicology 27, 2, Spring 2010, 135-180; and J. O'Rourke, 'Paul Wittgenstein: The One-Armed Piano Maestro of WWI,' BBC Arts, 5 November 2014. 12 Howe, 'Wittgenstein and the Performance of Disability'; O'Rourke, 'Paul Wittgenstein. 13 See 'Leopold Godowsky Left Hand: Chopin Études and Other Pieces for the Left Hand Alone', n.d., https://www.forte-piano-pianissimo.com/Godowsky-Left-Hand.html (accessed 26 June 2018). 14 ThePiano.SG, 'Introduction to Leopold Godowsky, his 53 Studies on Chopin's Études, and Passacaglia, n.d., https://www.thepiano.sg/piano/read/introduction-leopold-godowsky-his-53-studies-chopins-etudes-and-passacaglia (accessed 26 June 2018). 15 E.

According to Waugh, Zichy was an acquaintance of Paul's; Waugh, House of Wittgenstein. 16 I am in the first phase of a conversation with Johannesburg pianist Jill Richards, who is passionate about experimental piano performance, and has some familiarity with the left-handed repertoire. 17 Alain Badiou, Wittgensteins Anti-Philosophy, Bruno Bosteels (trans.)

His other impactful and significant writings are in letters, or in the celebrated 'notebooks' written up by scholars who attended his classes - a group who have, perhaps unfairly, been identified as disciples. The writings are not standard philosophy, but in the nature of epigram, such as Pascal wrote - leaving readers to 'find' a skein of thought across diffuse iterations collected at various times. 21 This event is discussed in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy and in 'A Discussion Between Wittgenstein and Moore on Certainty' (1939): From the Notes of Norman Malcolm', Mind, 124, 493, January 2015, 73-84.

However, selection in a great number of medical schools worldwide is still based on knowledge exams, a procedure that might neglect students with needed personal characteristics for future medical practice. We investigated whether the personal profile of students selected through a knowledge-based exam differed from those not selected. METHODS: Students applying for medical school (N=311) completed questionnaires assessing motivations for becoming a doctor, learning approaches, personality traits, empathy, and coping styles. Selection was based on the results of MCQ tests. Principal component analysis was used to draw a profile of the students. Differences between selected and non-selected students were examined by Multivariate ANOVAs, and their impact on selection by logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Students demonstrating a profile of diligence with higher conscientiousness, deep learning approach, and task-focused coping were more frequently selected (p=0.01). Other personal characteristics such as motivation, sociability, and empathy did not significantly differ, comparing selected and non-selected students. CONCLUSION: Selection through a knowledge-based exam privileged diligent students.

"SHVRLWQS","journalArticle","2020","","Predicting Empathy From Resting State Brain Connectivity: A Multivariate Approach","Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience","","1662-5145","","","Recent task fMRI studies suggest that individual differences in trait empathy and empathic concern are mediated by patterns of connectivity between self-other resonance and top-down control networks that are stable across task demands. An untested implication of this hypothesis is that these stable patterns of connectivity should be visible even in the absence of empathy tasks. Using machine learning, we demonstrate that patterns of resting state fMRI connectivity (i.e. the degree of synchronous BOLD activity across multiple cortical areas in the absence of explicit task demands) of resonance and control networks predict trait empathic concern (n = 58). Empathic concern was also predicted by connectivity patterns within the somatomotor network. These findings further support the role of resonance-control network interactions and of somatomotor function in our vicariously driven concern for others. Furthermore, a practical implication of these results is that it is possible to assess empathic predispositions in individuals without needing to perform conventional empathy assessments.","2020","2021-06-05 11:25:04","2021-06-05 11:25:04","","","","","","","","Predicting Empathy From Resting State Brain Connectivity","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8539122068","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Correspondingly, drift measurements in science are used as a means of rating the intensity of a body-ownership illusion via which a participant in a controlled experiment perceives that an extracorporeal appendage, or virtual whole-body avatar is incorporated as part of one’s own body schema. In this research article, I will examine an applied performance by BeAnotherLab utilising the anti-disciplinary collective’s The Machine to Be Another as part of Good Chance’s Encampment project - this telepresence system produces a VR body illusion intended to increase empathy and reduce proximity between an immersant’s real body and that of a volunteer refugee counterpart. When scientifically-tested body illusions cross a paradigmatic boundary to be framed as immersive art, what are the ethical implications? Furthermore, are these kinds of virtual proprioceptive transactions across different kinds of social and political boundaries symptomatic of radical empathic acts, or a capitalistic desire for the acquisition of another’s experiences by virtual means? This article examines illusory bodily inhabitation through a Levinasian critical lens to consider the ethics of deterritorializing the immersant’s gaze and referring their sense of touch elsewhere to produce ‘narrative immersion’.","2017","2021-06-05 11:25:04","2021-06-05 11:25:04","","30-37","","3","22","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 7138533628","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This assessment, run entirely on a tablet, measures decision-making via a suite of neurocognitive tests in less than 30 minutes. The software measures several cognitive and decision-making traits of the user, including impulsivity, empathy, aggression, and several other traits linked to reoffending. Our analysis measured whether this assessment successfully predicted recidivism by testing probationers in a large urban city (Houston, TX, United States) from 2017 to 2019. To determine predictive validity, we used machine learning to yield cross-validated receiver-operator characteristics. Results gave a recidivism prediction value of 0.70, making it comparable to commonly used risk assessments. This novel approach diverges from traditional self-reporting, interview-based, and criminal-records-based approaches, and can also add a protective layer against bias, while strengthening model accuracy in predicting reoffense. In addition, subjectivity is eliminated and time-consuming administrative efforts are reduced. With continued data collection, this approach opens the possibility of identifying different levels of recidivism risk, by crime type, for any age, or gender, and seeks to steer individuals appropriately toward rehabilitative programs.

Currently, there are many devices that allow gathering biometric measurements from human beings, such as EEG Headsets or Health Bracelets. The massive data sets generated by tracking of EEG and physiology may be used, among other things, to infer knowledge about human moods and emotions. Apart from direct biometric signal measurement, eye tracking systems are nowadays capable of determining the point of gaze of the users when interacting in ICT environments, which provides an added value research on many different areas, such as psychology or marketing. We present a process in which devices for eye tracking, biometric and EEG signal measurements are synchronously used for studying both basic and complex emotions. We selected the least intrusive devices for different signal data collection given the study requirements and cost constraints, so users would behave in the most natural way possible. On the one hand, we have been able to determine basic emotions participants were experiencing by means of valence and arousal. On the other hand, a complex emotion such as empathy has also been detected. To validate the usefulness of this approach, a study involving 44 people has been carried out, where they were exposed to a series of affective stimuli while their EEG activity, biometric signals and eye position were synchronously recorded to detect self-regulation. The hypothesis of the work was that people who self regulated would show significantly different results when analyzing their EEG data. Participants were divided into two groups depending on whether Electro Dermal Activity (EDA) data indicated they self-regulated or not. The comparison of the results obtained using different machine learning algorithms for emotion recognition shows that using EEG activity alone as a predictor for self-regulation does not allow properly determining whether a person in self-regulation its emotions while watching affective stimuli. However, adequately combining different data sources in a synchronous way to detect emotions makes it possible to overcome the limitations of single detection methods.","2016","2021-06-05 11:25:04","2021-06-05 11:25:04","","","","","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8598475237","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we ask whether empathic responses towards unknown others are modulated by behavioural similarity as a potential marker of genetic relatedness. Participants watched two supposed human players who were modelled as having a strong (player LP) or weak (player NLP) tendency to lead in social situations executing penalty shots in a virtual reality robot soccer game. As predicted, empathic response were modulated by shared behavioural traits: participants whose tendency to lead was more similar to player LP’s tendency to lead experienced more reward, and showed stronger neural activity in reward-related brain regions, when they saw player LP score a goal, and participants whose tendency to lead was more similar to player NLP’s tendency to lead showed stronger empathic responses when they saw player NLP score a goal. These findings highlight the potentially evolutionary grounded role of phenotypic similarity for neural processes underlying human social perception.","2020","2021-06-05 11:26:13","2021-06-05 11:26:13","","1-9","","1","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8539612951","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We investigated this relationship in adults who had engaged in extraordinarily costly real-world altruism: donating a kidney to a stranger. Altruists and controls completed fMRI testing while anticipating and experiencing pain, and watching as a stranger anticipated and experienced pain. Machine learning classifiers tested for shared representation between experienced and observed distress. Altruists exhibited more similar representations of experienced and observed fearful anticipation spontaneously and following an empathy prompt in anterior insula and anterior/middle cingulate cortex, respectively, suggesting heightened empathic proclivities and abilities for fear. During pain epochs, altruists were distinguished by spontaneous empathic responses in anterior insula, anterior/mid-cingulate cortex and supplementary motor area, but showed no difference from controls after the empathy prompt. These findings (1) link shared multi-voxel representations of the distress of self and others to real-world costly altruism, (2) reinforce distinctions between empathy for sensory states like pain and anticipatory affective states like fear, and (3) highlight the importance of differentiating between the proclivity and ability to empathize.","2019","2021-06-05 11:27:09","2021-06-05 11:27:09","","","","1","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8187722235","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Whether representing anthropomorphized characters navigating very human experiences or depicting four-legged creatures impacted by human action, this strategy has the manifest intent of fostering viewer identification and empathy. In particular, artists sometimes deploy animal avatars in representations of persecution and historical trauma to avoid depicting identity categories such as race, nationality and sexuality, which constitute the ostensible basis for persecution. In this way, the use of animals to represent human suffering universalizes experiences for which difference matters. In this essay, I explore how these animal stand-ins enable or foreclose empathy with Palestinian victims in the close reading of two primary texts, “War Rabbit” and Waltz with Bashir, which employ animal avatars in place of a direct depiction of Palestinian suffering. These illustrated narratives, one a comic and one an animated film, visually rhyme animal and human suffering and verbally lament the deaths of animals. I argue that both texts fail to unpack the analogies they construct, such that these constructions ultimately represent the actual Palestinians victims as being mute and irrational. Thus this use of animal avatars, which is meant to be foster empathy, is instead oblique, and risks further dehumanizing victims and negating their experiences.","2018","2021-06-05 11:27:37","2021-06-05 11:27:37","","","","3","7","","","Dehumanized Victims","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8539106124","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The virtual coach methodology is based on a practical and “future orientated” model, focus on the user goals. Basically, the virtual agent is guiding the user through different stages and intermediate goals. Those “easy to reach” intermediate goals will allow the user to reach a more ambitious ones. The Empathic Virtual Coach (VC) is being designed to run on tablets, smartphones, PCs, laptops, or even on a large-screen TV. Our ambitions is to easily adapt the solution to the user’s home and to avoid unfamiliar gadgets or devices. Moreover, The VC communication is through a simple and natural conversation (non-intrusive technologies). The Empathic-VC development is based on an end-user driven design, involving healthy seniors from the first phase up to the last prototype. In order to achieve a real co-design, we are involving 180 participants distributed in three different countries (Norway, Spain and France). The target population refers to people between 65 and 79 years old healthy with no relevant chronic diseases. In addition, we will target a set of people with depressive symptoms. The VC development consider 3 main field studies carried out from 2018 to 2020. The field studies are defined as: 1) Approach validation by user 2) Early prototype 3) mature prototype. Every participant will be involved in each field study (from design to prototype). Currently we are implementing the approach validation based on a Wizard of OZ (WOZ) approach. Basically, for this first step the tools used are: 1) Well-being questionnaires, 2) WOZ interaction and 3) Ad-hoc user acceptance questionnaire. The selected Well-being questionnaires are the Geriatric Depression Scale- 30 items and the World Health Organization Quality of Life -26 items. Both questionnaires are validated on the 3 considered countries. The WOZ setup includes a screen showing an avatar. The avatar interacts with the participant mainly through speech. Importantly, the conversation/feedback provided by the avatar is controlled by a human (i.e. the wizard). A key fact is that participants must not be aware of this human control. They must believe that they are interacting with a machine (principle idea of the WOZ method). However, the Wizard is not freely controlling the output. We have stablished a protocol and dialog structure in order to test all the features that we are aiming to developed. The initial protocol, which is common for the 3 countries will evolved depending on the participant interaction. The wizard is adapting the dialog structure based on interactions. Finally, the consortium has developed a user acceptance questionnaire in order to evaluate: the willingness to interact, the pragmatism of the solution, the interaction experience, the attractiveness of the solution and the potential applications.  All the user input gathered from the WOZ studies will be adapted and implemented on the early VC prototype. Thus integrating the end-user opinion within the solution design.","2019","2021-06-05 11:27:37","2021-06-05 11:27:37","","","","","19","","","Designing a virtual coach","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8539732089","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"8Z6XPF5B","journalArticle","2021","Cambra-Badii I; Guardiola E; Baños JE","Frankenstein; or, the modern Prometheus: a classic novel to stimulate the analysis of complex contemporary issues in biomedical sciences.","BMC medical ethics","","","","","BACKGROUND: Advances in biomedicine can substantially change human life. However, progress is not always followed by ethical reflection on its consequences or scientists' responsibility for their creations. The humanities can help health sciences students learn to critically analyse these issues; in particular, literature can aid discussions about ethical principles in biomedical research. Mary Shelley's Frankenstein; or, the modern Prometheus (1818) is an example of a classic novel presenting complex scenarios that could be used to stimulate discussion. MAIN TEXT: Within the framework of the 200th anniversary of the novel, we searched PubMed to identify works that explore and discuss its value in teaching health sciences. Our search yielded 56 articles, but only two of these reported empirical findings. Our analysis of these articles identified three main approaches to using Frankenstein in teaching health sciences: discussing the relationship between literature and science, analysing ethical issues in biomedical research, and examining the importance of empathy and compassion in healthcare and research. After a critical discussion of the articles, we propose using Frankenstein as a teaching tool to prompt students to critically analyse ethical aspects of scientific and technological progress, the need for compassion and empathy in medical research, and scientists' responsibility for their discoveries. CONCLUSION: Frankenstein can help students reflect on the personal and social limits of science, the connection between curiosity and scientific progress, and scientists' responsibilities.

For the first time, immersive virtual reality was used to place parents in the position of a child in order to assess impact on perspective-taking and empathy. This novel study was conducted with 20 non-high risk Spanish mothers (a pilot study with 12 mothers is reported in supplementary files). Mothers were virtually embodied as a 4-year-old child, experienced from the first-person perspective and with virtual and real body movements synchronised. They interacted with a ‘mother avatar’, which responded either in a Positive or Negative way. Participants reported a strong body ownership illusion for the child body that led to cognitive, emotional and physical reactions. Experiencing negative maternal behavior increased levels of empathy. In addition, the Negative mother led to increased feelings of fear of violence. Physiological data indicated greater stress in the Negative than Positive condition. Although further research is required to assess the effectiveness of such methods, any improvement in empathy that leads to a change in parenting behavior has the potential to impact on developmental outcomes for children.","2018","2021-06-05 11:28:14","2021-06-05 11:28:14","","1-10","","1","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8080991200","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Specifically, we vary levels of interaction fidelity to investigate how responsiveness and behavioural realism affect people’s experience of interacting with virtual humans. This is accomplished through the creation of Cinemacraft, a technology-mediated immersive platform for collaborative human–computer interaction. Cinemacraft leverages a voxel game engine similar to Minecraft to facilitate collaborative interaction in a virtual 3D world and incorporates sensory fusion to improve the fidelity of real-time collaboration. The primary hypothesis of the study is that embodied interactions result in a higher degree of presence, and that sensory fusion can improve the quality of presence and co-presence. We tested our hypothesis through a user-study of 24 participants. Based on suggestions from existing literature, we sidestep the uncanny valley effect through the use of low fidelity avatars (a la Minecraft) and identify cues that impact users ratings of presence, co-presence and successful collaboration. The findings and ensuing data in this research can be applied to produce a more compelling platform for live collaborative interactions, performances, and empathetic storytelling. This research contributes to the field of immersive, collaborative interaction by making transparent the platform, methodology, instruments and code accessible for team members with less technological expertise, as well as developers aspiring to use interactive 3D media to promote further experimentation and conceptual discussions.","2019","2021-06-05 11:29:20","2021-06-05 11:29:20","","53-73","","1","24","","","Cinemacraft","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8545091127","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, only few studies have investigated how functional network changes are related to social anhedonia. The aim of this fMRI study was to classify subjects according to their degree of social anhedonia using supervised machine learning. More specifically, we extracted both spatial and temporal network features during a social cognition task from 70 subjects, and used support vector machines for classification. Since impairment in social cognition is well established in schizophrenia-spectrum disorders, the subjects performed a comic strip task designed to specifically probe theory of mind (ToM) and empathy processing. Features representing both temporal (time series) and network dynamics were extracted using task activation maps, seed region analysis, independent component analysis (ICA), and a newly developed multi-subject archetypal analysis (MSAA), which here aimed to further bridge aspects of both seed region analysis and decomposition by incorporating a spotlight approach.We found significant classification of subjects with elevated levels of social anhedonia when using the times series extracted using MSAA, indicating that temporal dynamics carry important information for classification of social anhedonia. Interestingly, we found that the same time series yielded the highest classification performance in a task classification of the ToM condition. Finally, the spatial network corresponding to that time series included both prefrontal and temporal-parietal regions as well as insula activity, which previously have been related schizotypy and the development of schizophrenia.","2019","2021-06-05 11:29:20","2021-06-05 11:29:20","","4965-4981","","17","40","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8199458307","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This assessment, run entirely on a tablet, measures decision-making via a suite of neurocognitive tests in less than 30 minutes. The software measures several cognitive and decision-making traits of the user, including impulsivity, empathy, aggression, and several other traits linked to reoffending. Our analysis measured whether this assessment successfully predicted recidivism by testing probationers in a large urban city (Houston, TX, United States) from 2017 to 2019. To determine predictive validity, we used machine learning to yield cross-validated receiver-operator characteristics. Results gave a recidivism prediction value of 0.70, making it comparable to commonly used risk assessments. This novel approach diverges from traditional self-reporting, interview-based, and criminal-records-based approaches, and can also add a protective layer against bias, while strengthening model accuracy in predicting reoffense. In addition, subjectivity is eliminated and time-consuming administrative efforts are reduced. With continued data collection, this approach opens the possibility of identifying different levels of recidivism risk, by crime type, for any age, or gender, and seeks to steer individuals appropriately toward rehabilitative programs. Suggestions for future research directions are provided.","2019","2021-06-05 11:29:20","2021-06-05 11:29:20","","","","","10","","","Assessing Risk Among Correctional Community Probation Populations","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8530793703","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Social chatbots’ appeal lies not only in their ability to respond to users’ diverse requests, but also in being able to establish an emotional connection with users. The latter is done by satisfying users’ need for communication, affection, as well as social belonging. To further the advancement and adoption of social chatbots, their design must focus on user engagement and take both intellectual quotient (IQ) and emotional quotient (EQ) into account. Users should want to engage with a social chatbot; as such, we define the success metric for social chatbots as conversation-turns per session (CPS). Using XiaoIce as an illustrative example, we discuss key technologies in building social chatbots from core chat to visual awareness to skills. We also show how XiaoIce can dynamically recognize emotion and engage the user throughout long conversations with appropriate interpersonal responses. As we become the first generation of humans ever living with artificial intelligenc (AI), we have a responsibility to design social chatbots to be both useful and empathetic, so they will become ubiquitous and help society as a whole.","2018","2021-06-05 11:29:20","2021-06-05 11:29:20","","10-26","","1","19","","","From Eliza to XiaoIce","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 7357410398","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we tested the effects of some socio-cognitive variables that could contribute to enhancing or reducing the implicit racial bias. The first aim of the study was to assess the beneficial effects of cooperation within a VR scenario, the second aim was to provide preliminary testing of the hypothesis that empathy and political attitudes could contribute to implicit bias about race, while the third aim was to explore the relationship between political attitudes and empathy. We had (Caucasian) participants embodied in a Black virtual body and engaged either in a cooperative (Coop group) or in a non-cooperative (Neutral group) activity with a confederate experimenter embodying another Black avatar. Before and after VR, we measured participants' implicit racial bias by means of Implicit Association Test (IAT) and their perceived closeness toward the confederate experimenter. Before VR we also assessed participants' political attitudes and empathy traits. Results revealed that, as compared to the Neutral group, the Coop group showed lower IAT scores after the social interaction. Interestingly, in the Neutral but not the Coop group the perceived closeness toward the confederate experimenter was associated with the initial racial bias: the more the participants reduced their distance, the more they reduced their IAT score. Moreover, reported traits of empathy and political attitudes significantly explained the variance observed in the initial implicit bias, with perspective-taking, empathic concern, and personal distress being significant predictors of the IAT scores. Finally, there was a relationship between political attitudes and empathy: the more participants considered themselves as left-wing voters, the higher their perspective-taking and empathic concern scores. We discuss these findings within the neuroscientific and social cognition field and encourage scholars from different domains to further explore whether and under which conditions a given manipulation for reducing racial bias could be efficiently transposed in VR.","2020","2021-06-05 11:29:20","2021-06-05 11:29:20","","","","","11","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8698096714","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To achieve such goal, this article uses a systematic literature review to assess the state-of-the-art, characterize the unit of analysis, and find new avenues for further research. The results indicate that, in high customer contact settings, service robots tend to outperform humans when performing standardized tasks, because of their mechanical and analytical nature. Evidence also shows that, in some cases, service robots have not yet achieved the desired technological maturity to proficiently replace humans. In other words, the technology is not quite there yet, but this does not contradict the fact that new robot technologies, enabled by AI, will be able to replace the employees’ empathetic intelligence.

However, while considerable progress has been made in recent years in terms of their technological realization, the ability of robots to interact with humans in an intuitive and social way is still quite limited. An important challenge for social robotics is to determine how to design robots that can perceive the user's needs, feelings, and intentions, and adapt to users over a broad range of cognitive abilities. It is conceivable that if robots were able to adequately demonstrate these skills, humans would eventually accept them as social companions. We argue that the best way to achieve this is using a systematic experimental approach based on behavioral and physiological neuroscience methods such as motion/eye-tracking, electroencephalography, or functional near-infrared spectroscopy embedded in interactive human-robot paradigms. This approach requires understanding how humans interact with each other, how they perform tasks together and how they develop feelings of social connection over time, and using these insights to formulate design principles that make social robots attuned to the workings of the human brain. In this review, we put forward the argument that the likelihood of artificial agents being perceived as social companions can be increased by designing them in a way that they are perceived as intentional agents that activate areas in the human brain involved in social-cognitive processing. We first review literature related to social-cognitive processes and mechanisms involved in human-human interactions, and highlight the importance of perceiving others as intentional agents to activate these social brain areas. We then discuss how attribution of intentionality can positively affect human-robot interaction by (a) fostering feelings of social connection, empathy and prosociality, and by (b) enhancing performance on joint human-robot tasks. Lastly, we describe circumstances under which attribution of intentionality to robot agents might be disadvantageous, and discuss challenges associated with designing social robots that are inspired by neuroscientific principles.","2017","2021-06-05 11:29:57","2021-06-05 11:29:57","","","","","8","","","Robots As Intentional Agents","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 7162799280","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Robotic interventions have been explored for use with ASD children worldwide revealing that robots encourage one-to-one social and emotional interactions. However, associations between interpersonal synchronisation and emotional empathy have not yet been directly explored in French and Japanese ASD children when they interact with a human or a robot under analogous experimental conditions. Using the paradigm of actor-perceiver, where the child was the actor and the robot or the human the perceiver, we recorded the autonomic heart rate activation and reported emotional feelings of ASD children in both countries. Japanese and French ASD children showed different interpersonal synchronisation when they interacted with the human perceiver, even though the human was the same in both countries. However, they exhibited similar interpersonal synchronisation when the perceiver was the robot. The findings suggest that the mechanism combining interpersonal synchronisation and emotional empathy might be weakened but not absent in ASD children and that both French and Japanese ASD children do spontaneously and unconsciously discern non verbal actions of non human partners through a direct matching process that occurs via automatic mapping.","2020","2021-06-05 11:30:23","2021-06-05 11:30:23","","","","1","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8681362712","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our objective is to contribute to the literature by exploring the pros and cons of the use of service robots in the hospitality industry and to practice, by presenting the architectural and technological characteristics of a fully automated plant based on a relevant case. To achieve such goal, this article uses a systematic literature review to assess the state-of-the-art, characterize the unit of analysis, and find new avenues for further research. The results indicate that, in high customer contact settings, service robots tend to outperform humans when performing standardized tasks, because of their mechanical and analytical nature. Evidence also shows that, in some cases, service robots have not yet achieved the desired technological maturity to proficiently replace humans. In other words, the technology is not quite there yet, but this does not contradict the fact that new robot technologies, enabled by AI, will be able to replace the employees’ empathetic intelligence. In practical terms, organizations are facing challenges where they have to decide whether service robots are capable of completely replacing human labor or if they should rather invest in balanced options, such as human-robot systems, that seem to be a much more rational choice today.","2020","2021-06-05 11:30:47","2021-06-05 11:30:47","","","","","63","","","Service robots in the hospitality industry","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8671586679","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The problem in question is the limited use of heart rate (HR) as the prediction feature through the use of common classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Random Forest (RF) in emotion prediction. This paper aims to investigate whether HR signals can be utilized to classify four-class emotions using the emotion model from Russell’s in a virtual reality (VR) environment using machine learning. Method An experiment was conducted using the Empatica E4 wristband to acquire the participant’s HR, a VR headset as the display device for participants to view the 360° emotional videos, and the Empatica E4 real-time application was used during the experiment to extract and process the participant's recorded heart rate. Findings For intra-subject classification, all three classifiers SVM, KNN, and RF achieved 100% as the highest accuracy while inter-subject classification achieved 46.7% for SVM, 42.9% for KNN and 43.3% for RF.

At a high-level, the 3S Process consists of three stages (Story, Strategy, and Solution), which are described in detail in the article. Stage 1: Story in the process is inspired by the Harvard Case Method to provide context for a problem. Stage 2: Strategy uses Design Thinking to produce candidate solutions. The substage of Empathy in Design Thinking plays a crucial role to reduce bias in designing AI. Virtualization technology is a tool for students to experience hands-on learning in prototype development. Stage 3: Solution is where students advocate for their conceptual AI solution in the context of the case study. AI is a type of complex system; therefore, students should consider feedback loops and the potential for unintended biases to enter a deployed solution. The presentation of the 3S Process in this article is conceptual. Further empirical studies, including evaluations of the 3S Process in classroom settings, will be considered in the future.","2019","2021-06-05 11:32:03","2021-06-05 11:32:03","","36-42","","12","9","","","The 3S Process","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8558841868","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A mobile multimodal app was developed for the Android platform which would take as input a set of multisensory recorded memories such as videos, photos and music from a special memorable event in the affected person's life and turn them into a multimedia presentation that can be viewed or listened to. 34 healthy recruited participants were asked to wear the Empatica E4 sensor to record the heart rate variability and electrodermal activity of the skin. Data analysis revealed that the participants reacted positively to happy multimedia presentations. Implying a combination of music and reminiscence therapy can have a positive impact in the reduction of stress and agitation.","2020","2021-06-05 11:32:03","2021-06-05 11:32:03","","","","","18","","","Wearable sensors and a multisensory music and reminiscence therapies application","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8678454994","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

I move from a Surrealist advertising pamphlet produced in 1919 to the facial surgery techniques of 2018, contextualizing theories of the dyadic relationship between text and reader (Iser) with practices of image-solicitation and digital intimacy on the Internet. In unpacking self-surveillance techniques and state-run biometric technologies, this paper examines how our use of faces informs the ways our faces are used against us. Through analyzing how the performance of fantasy and the realization of authorship are imbricated through images of humankind, I research new developments in Augmented Reality avatars, linking the language of the face (Lévinas) as a staging ground for potential empathy and conversely, systematic exclusion. In tracing the data double while looking at the biopolitical function of social media, this paper considers how our images of humankind fix our embodied nature while fixing others in place.","2019","2021-06-05 11:32:03","2021-06-05 11:32:03","","102-123","","12","0","","","Fixing Being with Likeness","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8081478893","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Collectively, these have resulted in the modification of the physician's role as the gatekeeper for health care, increased shift-based care, and amplified interprofessional team-based care. Technological innovations present opportunities as well as challenges. Artificial intelligence, which has great potential, has already transformed some tasks, particularly those involving image interpretation. Ubiquitous access to information via the Internet by physicians and patients alike presents benefits as well as drawbacks: patients and providers have ready access to virtually all of human knowledge, but some websites are contaminated with misinformation and many people have difficulty differentiating between solid, evidence-based data and untruths. The role of the future physician will shift as complexity in health care increases and as artificial intelligence and other technologies advance. These technological advances demand new skills of physicians; memory and knowledge accumulation will diminish in importance while information management skills will become more important. In parallel, medical educators must enhance their teaching and assessment of critical human skills (e.g., clear communication, empathy) in the delivery of patient care. The authors emphasize the enduring role of critical human skills in safe and effective patient care even as medical practice is increasingly guided by artificial intelligence and related technology, and they suggest new and longitudinal ways of assessing essential noncognitive skills to meet the demands of the future. The authors envision practical and achievable benefits accruing to patients and providers if practitioners leverage technological advancements to facilitate the development of their critical human skills.","2021","2021-06-05 11:32:03","2021-06-05 11:32:03","","37-43","","1","96","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8662204413","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We conducted an experiment in which human participants held positive conversations with the robot by reading scenarios under conditions with and without vocal synchronization. We assessed seven subjective responses related to affective empathy (e.g., emotional connection) and measured the physiological emotional responses using facial electromyography from the corrugator supercilii and zygomatic major muscles as well as the skin conductance level. The subjective ratings consistently revealed heightened empathic responses to the robot in the synchronization condition compared with that under the de-synchronizing condition. The physiological signals showed that more positive and stronger emotional arousal responses to the robot with synchronization.

Automated machine learning classification of wearable biosensor signals requires quantitative measures of signal quality to automatically reject poor-quality or corrupt data segments. In this study, commercially available wearable sensors were placed on patients with epilepsy undergoing in-hospital or in-home electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring, and healthy volunteers. Empatica E4 and Biovotion Everion were used to record accelerometry (ACC), photoplethysmography (PPG), and electrodermal activity (EDA). Byteflies Sensor Dots were used to record ACC and PPG, the Activinsights GENEActiv watch to record ACC, and Epitel Epilog to record EEG data. PPG and EDA signals were recorded for multiple days, then epochs of high-quality, marginal-quality, or poor-quality data were visually identified by reviewers, and reviewer annotations were compared to automated signal quality measures. For ACC, the ratio of spectral power from 0.8 to 5 Hz to broadband power was used to separate good-quality signals from noise. For EDA, the rate of amplitude change and prevalence of sharp peaks significantly differentiated between good-quality data and noise. Spectral entropy was used to assess PPG and showed significant differences between good-, marginal-, and poor-quality signals. EEG data were evaluated using methods to identify a spectral noise cutoff frequency. Patients were asked to rate the usability and comfort of each device in several categories. Patients showed a significant preference for the wrist-worn devices, and the Empatica E4 device was preferred most often. Current wearable devices can provide high-quality data and are acceptable for routine use, but continued development is needed to improve data quality, consistency, and management, as well as acceptability to patients.","2020","2021-06-05 11:32:20","2021-06-05 11:32:20","","25","","","61","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8605798770","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Their acceptance in social and emotional human-robot interaction (HRI) scenarios depends on their ability to convey well recognized and believable emotional expressions to their human users. In this article, we incorporate recent findings from psychology, neuroscience, human-computer interaction, and HRI, to examine how people recognize and respond to emotions displayed by the body and voice of humanoid robots, with a particular emphasis on the effects of incongruence. In a social HRI laboratory experiment, we investigated contextual incongruence (i.e., the conflict situation where a robot’s reaction is incongrous with the socio-emotional context of the interaction) and cross-modal incongruence (i.e., the conflict situation where an observer receives incongruous emotional information across the auditory (vocal prosody) and visual (whole-body expressions) modalities). Results showed that both contextual incongruence and cross-modal incongruence confused observers and decreased the likelihood that they accurately recognized the emotional expressions of the robot. This, in turn, gives the impression that the robot is unintelligent or unable to express “empathic” behaviour and leads to profoundly harmful effects on likability and believability. Our findings reinforce the need of proper design of emotional expressions for robots that use several channels to communicate their emotional states in a clear and effective way. We offer recommendations regarding design choices and discuss future research areas in the direction of multimodal HRI.","2019","2021-06-05 11:32:20","2021-06-05 11:32:20","","555-573","","4","11","","","Multimodal Integration of Emotional Signals from Voice, Body, and Context","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8261196027","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These games enable the parallel gaming of multiple users in online virtual worlds with or against each other via their graphical agent (avatar). Recent findings suggest online role-playing addicts to have a deficient self-concept. The latter's potential compensation by means of a higher identification with the own avatar might be an etiological factor in the development of an online role-playing game addiction. On a neurobiological level, especially the left Angular Gyrus (AG) seems to be associated with identification and empathy processes. An according fMRI-based study on long-term gamers of online role-playing games indicated increased brain activations in the left AG during the rating of personality traits referring to the avatar relative to self-referencing and the referencing of close others (Ganesh et al., 2011). However, the extent to which these results represent specific neurobiological mechanisms that are associated with self-concept deficits or a stronger identification with the own avatar in the development of online role-playing game addiction remains unknown to date.<br>Methods: N=16 addicted and n=17 regular gamers of online role-playing games (mean age=28 and 26 years, respectively) underwent functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) while 1) completing a Giessen-Test (GT)-derived paradigm assessing participants’ concepts of self, ideal and avatar and 2) while viewing and evaluating images of the own person, the own avatar as well as unknown persons. Additionally, a questionnaire referring to the own body image and a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for the evaluation of the own as well as avatar's attractiveness, sympathy and gender identity were applied.<br>Results: Addicts of online role-playing games rated their body image, gender identity and social response (i.e. social popularity) significantly lower. Neurobiologically, they showed increased left AG activations during the reflection about their avatar (relative to their ideal and/or their self) compared to non-addicted gamers. Furthermore, within-group differences revealed left AG response during the perception of images showing their avatar (relative to images of themselves). In addition, addicted gamers had hypoactivations in the bilateral AG during the perception of images of their own person compared to the perception of unknown persons. The left-lateral AG hypoactivation positively correlated with the degree of the gender identity.<br>Discussion: In line with previous findings, our results indicate self-concept deficits in online role-playing game addicts and a stronger identification with the own avatar, which might neurobiologically be reflected in AG activations. The results could point towards problems in the formation of an own identity as a cause for online role-playing game addiction development. Longitudinal studies may shed light on these potentially causal relations.","2015","2021-06-05 11:32:20","2021-06-05 11:32:20","","123","","","30","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 5899638234","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This might be understood in an evolutionary context. Intense emotional tearing increases tear film volume and disturbs tear layer uniformity, resulting in blurry vision. A constriction of the pupils may help to mitigate this handicap, which in turn may have resulted in a perceptual association of both signals. However, direct empirical evidence for a role of pupil size in tearful emotional crying is still lacking. The present study examined socioemotional responses to different pupil sizes, combined with the presence (absence) of digitally added tears superimposed upon expressively neutral faces. Data from 50 subjects showed significant effects of observing digitally added tears in avatars, replicating previous findings for increased perceived sadness elicited by tearful photographs. No significant interactions were found between tears and pupil size. However, small pupils likewise elicited a significantly greater wish to help in observers. Further analysis showed a significant serial mediation of the effects of tears on perceived wish to help via perceived and then felt sadness. For pupil size, only felt sadness emerged as a significant mediator of the wish to help. These findings support the notion that pupil constriction in the context of intense sadness may function to counteract blurry vision.

Медичні науки","","2708-8634","","","Introduction. In view of the increasing medical possibilities to intervene the human body as wellas the possibilities of using body parts in research and commercial enterprises, the human bodyis considered as a useful instrument and even a marketable commodity.Aim. To defi ne the specifi city of the relationship of the human being to his body and the relationshipbetween the human beings in the world appealing to phenomenological and personalistperspective on the ethics of organ transplantation.Materials and methods. Analysis, comparison, description, generalization, phenomenologicalmethod.Results and discussion. The human body became an object of consumption, possession andinvestment. Thus, the human body is objectivated and alienated of the human Self. Jean Baudrillarddistinguished four models of body: 1) animal - as a set of instincts; 2) robot - as a labourforce; 3) mannequin - a body that has value and produces sexuality; 4) corpse - as the humanorganism examined by medicine. Hence, the human body is interpreted as an object of manipulationand ownership.The owner of the human body is defi ned in three ways: 1) religious - God is the owner of humanbody; 2) secular - a person owns his own body; 3) socialist - society owns human body.Personalism interprets the human person as the integrity of body and soul. To be human is alsoto be with others. Martin Buber distinguishes social relationship and interhuman relationship.Martin Heidegger defi nes the human as Dasein - “being-there”, being in the world under particularcircumstances and involved in daily activities. The core of human existence is “being-inthe-world” through our body. Yet, Dasein is only possible due to Mitdasein - being and workingtogether with others. We are “attuned” together in the world: we interact with others, feel empathyand compassion. We do not feel the other’s pain but we feel it with him and we sense anurge to help him. From this perspective, organ donation is not an issue of ownership or a trade,but the “gift of life” we can offer to others or receive from them.Conclusion. The body enables our “being-in-the-world” and “being-in-the-world-with-others”.Gifts are important for establishing and maintaining moral relationships between people. Therefore,donorship should be regarded as gift-giving in the context of our attunement with the others.","2017","2021-06-05 11:32:20","2021-06-05 11:32:20","","101-104","","2","50","","","THE HUMAN BODY FROM PHENOMENOLOGICAL AND PERSONALIST PERSPECTIVE","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8864846039","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While the main purpose of deploying robots has been productivity improvement, the current COVID-19 pandemic has brought more urgent purpose, providing contactless service for social distancing. This study explores the service quality provided by robots based on real data in a hotel setting. A sample of 201 guests provided their expected service quality by robots and the actual performance experience after the service. We analyzed this relationship using importance performance analysis (IPA) and the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). The results revealed that customers’ top priorities for robots’ service quality are assurance and reliability, while tangible and empathy were not as important. Customers were not satisfied with robots’ responsiveness, but this construct was found to be a low priority.","2020","2021-06-05 11:32:37","2021-06-05 11:32:37","","439-459","","3","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8653662571","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, these computer-delivered interventions rely on mouse, keyboard, or touchscreen responses for interactions between the users and the computer-delivered intervention. The principles of motivational interviewing suggest that in-person interventions may be effective, in part, because they encourage individuals to think through and speak aloud their motivations for changing a health behavior, which current computer-delivered interventions do not allow. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to take the initial steps toward development of a voice-based computer-delivered intervention that can ask open-ended questions and respond appropriately to users' verbal responses, more closely mirroring a human-delivered motivational intervention. METHODS: We developed (1) a voice-based computer-delivered intervention that was run by a human controller and that allowed participants to speak their responses to scripted prompts delivered by speech generation software and (2) a text-based computer-delivered intervention that relied on the mouse, keyboard, and computer screen for all interactions. We randomized 60 heavy drinking college students to interact with the voice-based computer-delivered intervention and 30 to interact with the text-based computer-delivered intervention and compared their ratings of the systems as well as their motivation to change drinking and their drinking behavior at 1-month follow-up. RESULTS: Participants reported that the voice-based computer-delivered intervention engaged positively with them in the session and delivered content in a manner consistent with motivational interviewing principles. At 1-month follow-up, participants in the voice-based computer-delivered intervention condition reported significant decreases in quantity, frequency, and problems associated with drinking, and increased perceived importance of changing drinking behaviors. In comparison to the text-based computer-delivered intervention condition, those assigned to voice-based computer-delivered intervention reported significantly fewer alcohol-related problems at the 1-month follow-up (incident rate ratio 0.60, 95% CI 0.44-0.83, P=.002). The conditions did not differ significantly on perceived importance of changing drinking or on measures of drinking quantity and frequency of heavy drinking. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that it is feasible to construct a series of open-ended questions and a bank of responses and follow-up prompts that can be used in a future fully automated voice-based computer-delivered intervention that may mirror more closely human-delivered motivational interventions to reduce drinking. Such efforts will require using advanced speech recognition capabilities and machine-learning approaches to train a program to mirror the decisions made by human controllers in the voice-based computer-delivered intervention used in this study. In addition, future studies should examine enhancements that can increase the perceived warmth and empathy of voice-based computer-delivered intervention, possibly through greater personalization, improvements in the speech generation software, and embodying the computer-delivered intervention in a physical form.","2017","2021-06-05 11:32:37","2021-06-05 11:32:37","","","","2","4","","","Initial Progress Toward Development of a Voice-Based Computer-Delivered Motivational Intervention for Heavy Drinking College Students","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 7088227141","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

If the patient shows decreased performance in a given task, the neurosurgeon will not remove these regions, so as to maintain all brain functions. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to describe our experience of using a virtual reality (VR) social network during awake craniotomy and discuss its future applications for perioperative mapping of nonverbal language, empathy, and theory of mind. METHODS: This was a single-center, prospective, unblinded trial. During wound closure, different VR experiences with a VR headset were proposed to the patient. This project sought to explore interactions with the neuropsychologist's avatar in virtual locations using a VR social network as an available experience. RESULTS: Three patients experienced VR. Despite some limitations due to patient positioning during the operation and the limitation of nonverbal cues inherent to the app, the neuropsychologist, as an avatar, could communicate with the patient and explore gesture communication while wearing a VR headset. CONCLUSIONS: With some improvements, VR social networks can be used in the near future to map social cognition during awake craniotomy.

Curtis","An Essay on Narrative, Reality, and Imagination","Psychoanalytic Inquiry","","0735-1690","","","Narrative is a verbal account, a story of related events which can be factual, fictional or both. Life experience and imagination are as essential to narrative as narrative is to mankind. The phylogenic perspective of literature suggests an inborn capacity for empathy, intelligence and inventiveness, whereas the ontological example is variable. Western knowledge, politics and ethics have evolved from their narrative of Greek myth, epic and drama, the few medieval writers, singularly by the Elizabethan theater, importantly the Arthurian legend and romance stories, English and Russian novels, and uniquely the American short story. This heritage progressively demarcated such life themes as the hero, maiden and adversary; love, hate and indifference; loyalty, deception and betrayal; desire, achievement and loss. These characterizations of self and other remain relevant to the contemporary novel, cinema/TV, and theater, as well as the news, commentary, and real life. Conversely, postmodern assumptions challenge that individual subjectivity determines what is real, valid or authentic, consequently the relativism of traditional, institutional and historical precedents of the truth. Further, the computer, gaming, smart device, and artificial intelligence have changed the content and function of customary narrative. Nonetheless, narrative - real and imagined, ancient and new - retains the meaning of a story about connected events which variously transcends the boundaries of difference.","2019","2021-06-05 11:32:37","2021-06-05 11:32:37","","476-484","","7","39","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8289454964","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

How people react to these agents is telling about the perceived empathy of such agents. Mistreatment of robots (or computers) by co-workers might provoke such telling reactions. This study examines perceived mistreatment directed towards a robot in comparison to a computer. This will provide some understanding of how people feel about robots in collaborative social settings. We conducted a two by two between-subjects study with 80 participants. Participants worked cooperatively with either a robot or a computer agent. An experiment confederate would either act aggressively or neutrally towards the agent. We hypothesized that people would not perceive aggressive speech as mistreatment when an agent was capable of emotional feelings and similar to themselves; that participants would perceive the robot as more similar in appearance and emotionally capable to themselves than a computer; and so would observe more mistreatment with a robot. The final results supported our hypotheses; the participants observed greater mistreatment for the robot, but not the computer. Also participants felt significantly more sympathetic towards the robot and believed that it was much more emotionally capable.","2019","2021-06-05 11:32:37","2021-06-05 11:32:37","","727-739","","5","11","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8545090891","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our work has involved extension of FAtiMA (Fearnot AffecTive Mind Architecture) with the addition of an Adaptive Engine to the FAtiMA cognitive agent architecture. We use machine learning to acquire the agent’s expertise by capturing a collection of user profiles into a user model and development of agent expertise based on the user model.

Results showed a significant reduction in stress in the empathic and neutral groups, but not the adaptive group.

This is important, because it generates specific risks that may be overlooked otherwise, and it justifies the necessity of human monitoring and emotional intervention in clinical medicine.

In particular, we conducted an exploratory study to empirically examine children's perceptions toward the computer- and robot-mediated AR systems designed to make dramatic play activities interactive and participatory. A multi-disciplinary expert group consisting of early childhood education experts, preschool teachers, AR specialists, and robot engineers collaborated to develop a learning scenario and technological systems for dramatic play. The experiment was conducted in a kindergarten setting in Korea, with 81 children (aged 5-6 years old). The participants were placed either in the computer-mediated AR condition (n = 40) or the robot-mediated AR condition (n = 41). We administered an instrument to measure children's perceived levels of the following variables: (a) satisfaction (i.e., interest in dramatic play & user-friendliness), (b) sensory immersion (i.e., self-engagement, environment-engagement & interaction-engagement), and (c) media recognition (i.e., collaboration with media, media function & empathy with media). Data analysis indicates that children in the robot-mediated condition showed significantly higher perceptions than those in the computer-mediated condition regarding the following aspects: interest in dramatic play (satisfaction), interactive engagement (sensory immersion), and empathy with media (media recognition). Furthermore, it was found that the younger-aged children and girls, in particular, perceived AR-infused dramatic play more positively than the olderaged children and boys, respectively. The contribution of this study is to provide empirical evidence about the affordances of robots and AR-based learning systems for young children. This remains a relatively unexplored area of research in the field of learning technologies.

The novelty of this method is that we analyze body motion-based features in frequency domain to estimate different human social patterns: Interpersonal Behaviors (IBs) and a Social Role (SR). To analyze the dynamics and interrelations of people's body motions, a human movement descriptor is used to extract discriminative features, and a multi-layer Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) technique is proposed to model the existent dependencies. Laban Movement Analysis (LMA) is a well-known human movement descriptor, which provides efficient mid-level information of human body motions. The mid-level information is useful to extract the complex interdependencies. The DBN technique is tested in different scenarios to model the mentioned complex dependencies.

A psychophysiological investigation","Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology","","2296-4185","","","Non-verbal signals expressed through body language play a crucial role in multi-modal human communication during social relations. Indeed, in all cultures facial expressions are the most universal and direct signs to express innate emotional cues. A human face conveys important information in social interactions and helps us to better understand our social partners and establish empathic links.Latest researches show that humanoid and social robots are becoming increasingly similar to humans, both aesthetically and expressively. However, their visual expressiveness is a crucial issue that must be improved to make these robots more realistic and intuitively perceivable by humans as not different from them.This study concerns the capability of a humanoid robot to exhibit emotion through facial expressions. More specifically, emotional signs performed by a humanoid robot have been compared with corresponding human facial expressions in terms of recognition rate and response time. The set of stimuli included standardized human expressions taken from an Ekman-based database and the same facial expressions performed by the robot. Furthermore, participants' psychophysiological responses have been explored to investigate whether there could be differences induced by interpreting robot or human emotional stimuli.Preliminary results show a trend to better recognize expressions performed by the robot than 2D photos or 3D models.

Digital dentistry requires managing expectations pragmatically and ensuring transparency for all stakeholders: patients, healthcare providers, university and research institutions, the medtech industry, insurance, public media, and state policy. It should not be claimed or implied that digital smart data technologies will replace humans providing dental expertise and the capacity for patient empathy. The dental team that controls digital applications remains the key and will continue to play the central role in treating patients.

AR/MR-based remote collaboration on physical tasks has recently become more prominent in academic research and engineering applications. It has great potential in many fields, such as real-time remote medical consultation, education, training, maintenance, remote assistance in engineering, and other remote collaborative tasks. However, to the best of our knowledge there has not been any comprehensive review of research in AR/MR remote collaboration on physical tasks. Therefore, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of research between 2000 and 2018 in this domain. We collected 215 papers, more than 80% of which were published between 2010 and 2018, and all relevant works are discussed at length. Then we elaborate on the review from typical architectures, applications (e.g., industry, telemedicine, architecture, teleducation and others), and empathic computing. Next, we made an in-depth review of the papers from seven aspects: (1) collection and classification research, (2) using 3D scene reconstruction environments and live panorama, (3) periodicals and conducting research, (4) local and remote user interfaces, (5) features of user interfaces commonly used, (6) architecture and sharing non-verbal cues, (7) applications and toolkits. We find that most papers (160 articles, 74.4%) are published in conferences, using co-located collaboration to emulate remote collaboration is adopted by more than half (126, 58.6%) of the reviewed papers, the shared non-verbal cues can be mainly classified into five types (Virtual Replicas or Physical Proxy(VRP), AR Annotations or a Cursor Pointer(ARACP), avatar, gesture, and gaze), the local/remote interface is mainly divided into four categories (Head-Mounted Displays(HMD), Spatial Augmented Reality(SAR), Windows-Icon-Menu-Pointer(WIMP) and Hand-Held Displays(HHD)). From this, we can draw ten conclusions. Following this we report on issues for future works. The paper also provides an overall academic roadmap and useful insight into the state-of-the-art of AR/MR remote collaboration on physical tasks.

We present a model which suggests that empathy is an <i>emergent</i> behavior with four main elements: a mirror neuron system, somatosensory cortices, an insula, and infant-directed “baby talk” or motherese. To test our hypothesis, we implemented a robot called MEI (multimodal emotional intelligence) with these functions, and allowed it to interact with human caregivers using comfort and approval motherese, the first kinds of vocalizations heard by infants at 3 and 6 months of age. The robot synchronized in real-time to the humans through voice and movement dynamics, while training statistical models associated with its low level gut feeling (“flourishing” or “distress”, based on battery or temperature). Experiments show that the post-interaction robot associates novel happy voices with physical flourishing 90 % of the time, sad voices with distress 84 % of the time. Our results also show that a robot trained with infant-directed “attention bids” can recognize adult fear voices. Importantly, this is the first emotion system to recognize adult emotional voices after training only with motherese, suggesting that this specific parental behavior may help build emotional intelligence.","2015","2021-06-05 11:32:56","2021-06-05 11:32:56","","35-49","","1","7","","","A Recipe for Empathy","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 5778623320","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These claims are based on a moderated mediation model. They reported a three-way interaction between game condition, gender, and avatar identification when predicting masculine ideology in their original study. Masculine ideology was associated, in turn, with decreased empathy. However, there were no main experimental effects for video game condition on empathy. The current analysis considers the strength of the evidence for claims made in the original study on a sample of 153 adolescents (M age = 16.812, SD = 1.241; 44.2% male). We confirmed that there was little evidence for an overall effect of game condition on empathy toward girls or women. We tested the robustness of the original reported moderated mediation models against other, theoretically derived alternatives, and found that effects differed based on how variables were measured (using alternatives in their public data file) and the statistical model used. The experimental groups differed significantly and substantially in terms of age suggesting that there might have been issues with the procedures used to randomly assign participants to conditions. These results highlight the need for preregistration of experimental protocols in video game research and raise some concerns about how moderated mediation models are used to support causal inferences. These results call into question whether use of ""sexist"" video games is a causal factor in the development of reduced empathy toward girls and women among adolescents.","2017","2021-06-05 11:34:10","2021-06-05 11:34:10","","2446-2459","","12","46","","","Are Associations Between ""Sexist"" Video Games and Decreased Empathy Toward Women Robust?","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 7088415745","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Short movie clips of two different robot heads showing a happy, sad, surprised, and neutral facial expression were compiled into an online survey, to examine how people interpret these expressions. Additionally, we added a control condition with a human face showing the same four emotions. The results showed that the facial expressions could be recognized well for both heads. Even the blender emotion surprised was recognized, although it resulted in positive and negative connotations. These results underline the importance of the situational context to correctly interpret emotional facial expressions. Besides the expected finding that the human is perceived significantly more anthropomorphic and animate than both robot heads, the more human-like designed robot head was rated significantly higher with respect to anthropomorphism than the robot head using animal-like features.

METHODS: Using transcripts from 353 primary care office visits with 350 patients and 84 physicians (Cook, 2002 [1], Tai-Seale et al., 2015 [2]), we developed two machine learning models (a recurrent neural network with a hierarchical structure and a logistic regression classifier) to recognize the emotional valence (positive, negative, neutral) (Posner et al., 2005 [3]) of each utterance. We examined the agreement of human-generated ratings of emotional valence with machine learning model ratings of emotion. RESULTS: The agreement of emotion ratings from the recurrent neural network model with human ratings was comparable to that of human-human inter-rater agreement. The weighted-average of the correlation coefficients for the recurrent neural network model with human raters was 0.60, and the human rater agreement was also 0.60. CONCLUSIONS: The recurrent neural network model predicted the emotional valence of patients and physicians in primary care visits with similar reliability as human raters.

Recently, DNA microarray technology became a powerful tool for cancer identification, that can analyze the expression level of a different and huge number of genes simultaneously. In microarray data, the large genes number versus a few records may affect the prediction performance. In order to handle this ""curse of dimensionality” constraint of microarray dataset while improving the cancer identification performance, a dimensional reduction phase is necessary. In this paper, we proposed a framework that combines dimensional reduction methods and machine learning algorithms in order to achieve the best cancer prediction performance using different microarray datasets. In the dimensional reduction phase, a combination of feature selection and feature extraction techniques was proposed. Pearson and Ant Colony Optimization was used to select the most important genes. Principal Component Analysis and Kernel Principal Component Analysis were used to linearly and non-linearly transform the selected genes to a new reduced space. In the cancer identification phase, we proposed four algorithms C5.0, Logistic Regression, Artificial Neural Network, and Support Vector Machine. Experimental results demonstrated that the framework performs effectively and competitively compared to state-of-the-art methods.ABSTRAK: Ramalan tumor kanser dan diagnosis pada peringkat awal telah menjadi keperluan dalam kajian kanser, kerana ia membuka peluang peningkatan kejayaan dalam rawatan.

Currently, there are many devices that allow gathering biometric measurements from human beings, such as EEG Headsets or Health Bracelets. The massive data sets generated by tracking of EEG and physiology may be used, among other things, to infer knowledge about human moods and emotions. Apart from direct biometric signal measurement, eye tracking systems are nowadays capable of determining the point of gaze of the users when interacting in ICT environments, which provides an added value research on many different areas, such as psychology or marketing. We present a process in which devices for eye tracking, biometric, and EEG signal measurements are synchronously used for studying both basic and complex emotions. We selected the least intrusive devices for different signal data collection given the study requirements and cost constraints, so users would behave in the most natural way possible. On the one hand, we have been able to determine basic emotions participants were experiencing by means of valence and arousal. On the other hand, a complex emotion such as empathy has also been detected. To validate the usefulness of this approach, a study involving forty-four people has been carried out, where they were exposed to a series of affective stimuli while their EEG activity, biometric signals, and eye position were synchronously recorded to detect self-regulation. The hypothesis of the work was that people who self-regulated would show significantly different results when analyzing their EEG data. Participants were divided into two groups depending on whether Electro Dermal Activity (EDA) data indicated they self-regulated or not. The comparison of the results obtained using different machine learning algorithms for emotion recognition shows that using EEG activity alone as a predictor for self-regulation does not allow properly determining whether a person in self-regulation its emotions while watching affective stimuli. However, adequately combining different data sources in a synchronous way to detect emotions makes it possible to overcome the limitations of single detection methods.","2016","2021-06-05 11:34:10","2021-06-05 11:34:10","","","","","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 6810599341","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As  a  result,  more  and  more  individuals need guidance and counselling. This care giving becomes even more important in a person’s life during times of hardship, for instance during pandemics like COVID-19 where social isolation makes it even more difficult to cope with mental anguish. Whereas there exist various interventions, guidance and counselling activities are not easily accessible for resource stricken communities and where it exists, then its efficacy is hard to measure. With appropriate guidance voluntary counsellors could assist fill the void for such societies and provide counselling to them for various mental anguishes thereby providing relief for such conditions some of which are quite debilitating. OBJECTIVES: The  main  objective  of  this  paper  is  to  encourage  the  uptake  of  counselling services  to  resource stricken communities in particular, by leveraging technology resulting in an increased ‘counselling culture’ that has empathy at its core.METHODS: Incorporating  National  Language  processing  (NLP)  into  online  unstructured  chat  discourses  during  a  counselling session with an end goal of achieving positive efficacies driven by empathetic approaches.  These approaches were  adopted  after  rigorous  consultations  with  a  Counselling  psychologist  and  also  via  views  derived  from  an  online  questionnaire sent anonymously. RESULTS:  An online web-based application that provides a counsellor the platform to provide ‘counselling services’ to persons  in  distress  by  way  of  chat  discourses.  These  Chat  discourses  are  then  filtered  through  the  IBM  Watson  platform  providing NLP and Artificial Intelligence capabilities to undertake lexical analysis in order to derive the emotional measure of the empathy level adopted in a chat discourse. As a result of the analysis, important statistical components like Precision and Recall are adopted in measuring the performance of the solution in terms of measuring, for instance, empathy inclusivity. Once Precision and Recall values are derived, the  F1 score is calculated.CONCLUSION: This study highlighted the critical need for counselling services especially in resource-stricken areas. In addition, socio-cultural norms sometimes are an impediment to effective counselling service delivery. The approach adopted in this paper resulted in an online web-based application that not only provides chat functionalities which are put through lexical  analysis  from  where  an  ‘Empathy  quotient’  is  derived  but  also  leverages  the  Natural  Language  Processing  and  Artificial Intelligence technologies. In this way, technology can provide an effective outreach methodology that provides in the very least a first-level counselling support structure. With purposive testing undertaken, it is evident that this study needs to be taken further to cover more areas of counselling and to strengthen the adoption of artificial intelligence in order to, for instance, leverage volunteers’ efforts vis-à-vis providing counselling services.","2020","2021-06-05 11:34:10","2021-06-05 11:34:10","","","","","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8894543495","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Twenty-one individuals were asked to play the ultimatum game, playing the role of a responder against another person, a computer, an avatar and a robot for a total of 32 games (8 per condition). We hypothesize that affective expressions by avatars and robots influence the emotional state of the users, leading them to irrational behavior by rejecting unfair proposals. We monitored galvanic skin response and heart rate of the players in the period when the offer was made by the proposer until the decision was announced by the responder. Our results show that most fair offers were accepted while most unfair offers were rejected. However, participants rejected more very unfair offers made by people and computers than by the avatars or robots.","2019","2021-06-05 11:34:10","2021-06-05 11:34:10","","","","1","31","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8464672719","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hundreds of genetic variants are expected to influence its complex development, but few have been identified. We used a machine learning method for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to uncover complex genotypic–phenotypic networks and environmental interactions. The Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) measured the self-regulatory components of personality critical for health (i.e., the character traits of self-directedness, cooperativeness, and self-transcendence). In a discovery sample of 2149 healthy Finns, we identified sets of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that cluster within particular individuals (i.e., SNP sets) regardless of phenotype. Second, we identified five clusters of people with distinct profiles of character traits regardless of genotype. Third, we found 42 SNP sets that identified 727 gene loci and were significantly associated with one or more of the character profiles. Each character profile was related to different SNP sets with distinct molecular processes and neuronal functions. Environmental influences measured in childhood and adulthood had small but significant effects. We confirmed the replicability of 95% of the 42 SNP sets in healthy Korean and German samples, as well as their associations with character. The identified SNPs explained nearly all the heritability expected for character in each sample (50 to 58%). We conclude that self-regulatory personality traits are strongly influenced by organized interactions among more than 700 genes despite variable cultures and environments. These gene sets modulate specific molecular processes in brain for intentional goal-setting, self-reflection, empathy, and episodic learning and memory.","2018","2021-06-05 11:35:24","2021-06-05 11:35:24","","2295-2312","","10","25","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8671687952","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Facing challenges wrought by science and technology as well as societal change, the curriculum is increasingly out of synch with new needs in teaching content and medical practice. The path to significant curricular reform is difficult because of a variety of factors, including deeply entrenched values, the natural resistance to change, and the accreditation process. Indeed, even the very definition of what it means to be a professional is changing with profound implications for the future role of the physician and the sacrosanct doctor-patient relationship.In this Invited Commentary, the author enumerates challenges facing medical education in the current era. To address these challenges, the author recommends specific curricular emphases for 21st-century medical education: knowledge capture and curation, collaboration with and management of artificial intelligence applications, a deep understanding of probabilistic reasoning, and the cultivation of empathy and compassion in accordance with ethical standards.

Automated, objective pain detection from physiological data in patients provides valuable information to hospital staff and caregivers to better manage pain, particularly for patients who are unable to self-report. Galvanic skin response (GSR) is one of the physiologic signals that refers to the changes in sweat gland activity, which can identify features of emotional states and anxiety induced by varying pain levels. This study used different statistical features extracted from GSR data collected from postoperative patients to detect their pain intensity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work building pain models using postoperative adult patients instead of healthy subjects. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to present an automatic pain assessment tool using GSR signals to predict different pain intensities in noncommunicative, postoperative patients. METHODS: The study was designed to collect biomedical data from postoperative patients reporting moderate to high pain levels. We recruited 25 participants aged 23-89 years. First, a transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) unit was employed to obtain patients' baseline data. In the second part, the Empatica E4 wristband was worn by patients while they were performing low-intensity activities. Patient self-report based on the numeric rating scale (NRS) was used to record pain intensities that were correlated with objectively measured data. The labels were down-sampled from 11 pain levels to 5 different pain intensities, including the baseline. We used 2 different machine learning algorithms to construct the models. The mean decrease impurity method was used to find the top important features for pain prediction and improve the accuracy. We compared our results with a previously published research study to estimate the true performance of our models. RESULTS: Four different binary classification models were constructed using each machine learning algorithm to classify the baseline and other pain intensities (Baseline [BL] vs Pain Level [PL] 1, BL vs PL2, BL vs PL3, and BL vs PL4). Our models achieved higher accuracy for the first 3 pain models than the BioVid paper approach despite the challenges in analyzing real patient data. For BL vs PL1, BL vs PL2, and BL vs PL4, the highest prediction accuracies were achieved when using a random forest classifier (86.0, 70.0, and 61.5, respectively). For BL vs PL3, we achieved an accuracy of 72.1 using a k-nearest-neighbor classifier. CONCLUSIONS: We are the first to propose and validate a pain assessment tool to predict different pain levels in real postoperative adult patients using GSR signals. We also exploited feature selection algorithms to find the top important features related to different pain intensities.

The question becomes whether these are minimal criteria, or hierarchical, such that those who fulfill them to greater degree should be afforded greater consideration. This article questions the validity and necessity of drawing divisions among beings that satisfy the minimum requirements for personhood; considering how future beings-intelligent androids, synthezoids, even alternate-substrate sentiences-might fit alongside the ""baseline"" human. I ask whether these alternate beings ought to be considered different to us, and why this may or may not matter in terms of a notion of ""human community.""

Batty is stronger, faster, more resilient, and more intelligent than Homo sapiens.

Empathy emerged as a significant predictor of prosocial behavior. Social avoidance, in turn, was not predicted by any of the included variables. Also, there was no effect of agency on social presence, physical presence, social interaction anxiety and stress.

However, as the opportunities offered by technology and artificial intelligence increase, digital assistants can also provide emotional support, which refers to empathetic, reassuring expressions for customers who have failed or succeeded in fulfilling a task. We show across four experiments that emotional support offered by a digital assistant increases customer satisfaction (Study 1 and 2) and persistence (Study 3 and 4) in using technology-mediated services. The increase in satisfaction occurs via the perceived warmth of the digital assistant, and the increase in persistence via the serial mediation of perceived warmth and satisfaction. Further, the results of a moderated serial mediation show that the effect on persistence only occurs when a digital (but not when a human) assistant provides emotional support in technology-mediated services. Finally, the effect of emotional support on persistence occurs independently of the digital assistant's embodiment.

Demikian juga dengan alat musik tradisional Bangka yang mulai kehilangan popularitasnya. Kondisi saat ini, para remaja di Bangka kebanyakan tidak dapat memainkan alat musik tradisionalnya. Begitu juga dengan anak-anak yang belum mengetahui dan bahkan tidak mengenal alat musik tradisional daerah mereka. Jika kondisi ini dibiarkan, dikhawatirkan keberadaan alat musik tradisional Bangka akan hilang, begitu juga dengan sumber daya manusia yang dapat memainkannya. Untuk menghindari hal tersebut, dibuatlah aplikasi pengenalan alat musik tradisional Bangka menggunakan Augmented Reality (AR). AR dipilih karena dapat memberikan gambaran alat musik secara real time dalam bentuk 3D sesuai dengan pergerakan kamera smartphone yang dinamis. Empat objek 3D alat musik yakni dambus, rebab, rebanatamborin, dan gong yang dibuat menggunakan Autodesk Maya. AR yang dibangun menggunakan metode berbasis marker. Metode ini dipilih agar lebih mudah digunakan oleh pengguna yang mayoritasnya adalah anak-anak. Selain itu, kelebihan metode ini memiliki tingkat akurasi posisi yang sangat tinggi. Unity sebagai engine untuk penerapan AR 3D modelling pada sistem Android dan Vuforia SDK sebagai engine pembentuk marker augmented reality. Pengujian fungsional memiliki hasil 100% dengan sistem yang berjalan baik. Hasil pengujian kinerja deteksi objek AR berdasarkan intensitas cahaya diketahui bahwa smartphone yang memiliki dua kamera di bagian belakang dapat mendeteksi objek dengan intensitas cahaya 0 Lux pada malam hari dengan kondisi gelap, sedangkan yang hanya memiliki satu kamera tidak dapat mendeteksi objek. Pengujian warna marker mendapatkan hasil modifikasi warna marker pink, kuning, dan hitam yang masih memungkinkan untuk pendeteksian objek, walaupun objek yang tampil tidak stabil. Dari pengujian kertas marker diketahui bahwa jenis kertas tidak berpengaruh terhadap pendeteksian objek. Pengujian beta dilakukan dengan cara membagikan kuesioner terkait pengalaman pengguna dalam penggunaan sistem. Hasil survei diketahui pengguna merasa sangat setuju dengan nilai sebesar 80%, bahwa penggunaan sistem dapat membantu mereka dalam mengenal alat musik tradisional Bangka.   With the incessant development of technology, awareness on the importance of traditional musical instruments has declined. Similarly, teenagers living in Bangka no longer play their traditional musical instruments, and children are not exposed to their cultural heritage. However, if this continues, it is feared that the existence of traditional Bangka musical instruments will soon go extinct. To avoid this, researchers have proposed an application to identify this media using Augmented Reality (AR). This technique was chosen due to its ability to provide visuals of musical instruments in real time using 3D models in accordance with the dynamic movement of smartphone cameras. This comprises of four 3D objects namely dambus, rebab, rebanatamborin, and gong, which were designed and developed using Autodesk Maya. AR is built using marker-based methods, which was chosen for easy use because majority of its users are children, and its high level of accuracy. Unity was utilized as an engine for its implementation in the Android system, and Vuforia SDK as augmented reality marker-builder engine. Functional testing showed 100% results which means that the system is running well. From the results of the AR object detection performance test based on light intensity it is known that a smartphone with two cameras in the backside has the ability to detect objects with a light intensity of 0 Lux in dark rooms, while the other smartphone with one camera failed to detect the objects. Color testing obtained a modification of marker colors comprising of pink, yellow, and black which are still able to detect objects, although not stable. The paper test marker has no effect on object detection. Beta testing questionnaires were used to obtain information related to user experience. From the survey results, it is known that users strongly agree (80%) that the use of the system helps them to recognize traditional Bangka musical instruments.","2019","2021-06-05 11:35:24","2021-06-05 11:35:24","","89-105","","2","5","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8156333847","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Companies trust that technology collects all available information, processes it and makes the best management decisions - productive optimization - for the benefit of it. With this, the supervisors and middle managers are replaced, as well as the human resources experts, leaving the direction of the workers in the hands of automated processes managed by algorithms - or in their most advanced state, in Artificial Intelligence. In this work, the health hazards that new form of technological management can cause are exposed. Indeed, the constant monitoring through sensors, the intensification of work derived from the decisions taken by a machine without empathy or knowledge about human limits, the reduction of autonomy of the worker subjected to the decisions made by Artificial Intelligence, discriminations, under a blanket of algorithmic neutrality of these decisions, as well as possible operational errors, they can end up causing serious physical and psychological health problems for workers. These risks can be reduced if they are taken into account in programming. In this work, the need for a correct programming of the algorithm to assess the exposed occupational risks is defended. That is to say, in the same way that a supervisor must have training in risk prevention to be able to carry out his work, the algorithm must be programmed to weigh the occupational hazards at work - and in case of not having this programming, its use to direct workers should be banned. Specifically, the algorithm must be transparent, adapted to the real capabilities of the worker, must leave somemargin of autonomy for the worker and respect their privacy. In short, the algorithm must assess any element that poses a risk to the safety and health of workers. To do this, it is argued that the mandatory risk assessment, carried out by the technicians, should be done focused on programming the algorithm so that it respects it in decision making in the work direction.","2019","2021-06-05 11:35:41","2021-06-05 11:35:41","","1-38","","ues","5","","","According to the first law on robotics","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8464642255","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is concluded that attention to relationality and to verbal and non-verbal languages of suffering is key to understand the phenomenon under investigation, and that in robot ethics we need less certainty and more caution and patience when it comes to thinking about moral standing.","2018","2021-06-05 11:35:41","2021-06-05 11:35:41","","141-158","","1","20","","","Why Care About Robots?","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 7891589659","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The challenge stems partly from the complexity and fluidity of this social process, but also from its covert nature. One powerful tool to enhance experimental control over such dynamic social interactions has been the use of avatars in virtual reality (VR); information about an individual in such an interaction can be collected through the analysis of his or her neurophysiological and behavioral responses. We have developed a unique platform, the Empathy-Enhancing Virtual Evolving Environment (EEVEE), which is built around three main components: (1) different avatars capable of expressing feelings and emotions at various levels based on the Facial Action Coding System (FACS); (2) systems for measuring the physiological responses of the observer (heart and respiration rate, skin conductance, gaze and eye movements, facial expression); and (3) a multimodal interface linking the avatar's behavior to the observer's neurophysiological response. In this article, we provide a detailed description of the components of this innovative platform and validation data from the first phases of development. Our data show that healthy adults can discriminate different negative emotions, including pain, expressed by avatars at varying intensities. We also provide evidence that masking part of an avatar's face (top or bottom half) does not prevent the detection of different levels of pain.

The aim of this paper is to explore a framework for the relationship between education, values and new technologies within the present social and economic context. In it, the role of rationality, emotions, empathy, creativity and the possibility of developing a broader concept of “mind” for empowering human beings and helping us to better understand ourselves and the world will also be examined. In essence, the paper contains a summary of the main ideas discussed in the Fifth Altius conference on “Educating for the Future” at the Oxford Union,† which took place between September 28 and 30, 2018.‡ Due to the Chatham House Rule requirements, attribution has been avoided. Thus, the report is focused on the presentation of the most relevant concepts and arguments expressed by the speakers and exchanged with the audience. In any case, the report is not exhaustive and it does not necessarily reflect the order of events followed at the Oxford Union. Rather, it is aimed at exposing, in a concise manner, the principal themes that were explored during the conference and the key practical suggestions drawn from different sessions.","2019","2021-06-05 11:35:41","2021-06-05 11:35:41","","129-147","","6","3","","","Educating for the Future","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8156373970","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"HWDTYRT7","journalArticle","2017","Richard Stillman II; Richard Stillman II","Public professionalism in an era of radical transformations: its meaning, challenges, and training","Revista de Administração Pública","","0034-7612","","","ArticlePublic professionalism in an era of radical transformations: its meaning, challenges, and trainingProfesionalismo público en una era de transformaciones radicales: su significado, desafíos y entrenamientoRichard Stillman II1  2  1University of Colorado / EUA2Public Administration Review/ EUAPublic professionalism lives within a schizophrenic world today. On one hand more people aspire to be professionals than ever before. As the late Everett Hughes, perhaps the most eminent scholar of this topic, once wrote, “professions are more numerous than ever before. Professional people are a larger portion of the labor force. The professional attitude or mood is likewise more widespread; professional status more sought after.” Everywhere in advanced and developing nations public professionals and professionalism are triumphant in contributing to the GDP growth to shaping and implementing most if not all areas of public policy. In 2017 27% of the full-time American Federal Workforce are classed as professionals, 37% as administrators, and 27% as technical personnel such as 5,521 economists, 35,529 nurses, 20,115 electronics engineers, 17,118 attorneys, and 242 museum curators. Thus over a one-third of federal employees are classed as “professional-technical (a figure which would be much higher if contract employees were included). So widespread is professionalization that long ago, Frederick Mosher termed government as “the professional state”; or Don Price referred to it as “the scientific estate” or Zbigniew Brzezinski called it “the technocratic society”. Whatever it is labelled, public professionals unquestionably make modern government tick and contemporary society run. Yet, in 2017 western nations are reeling from widespread, determined populist revolts against unelected officials. Voter cries against public professionals and their pervasive influence over shaping public policy are loud and frequent. The Brexit vote last year in England sought independence from those unseen, unelected EU officials in Brussels. Donald Trump’s presidential inauguration this year can be attributed significantly to the fact he was “an outsider” who had never been an elected politician, nor even served in any public position, even the military (the first such president ever in U.S. History). His campaign targets were established institutions such as Nato, the Paris Climate Accords, Affordable Health Care, the CIA, and more recently the FBI Director. France, Italy, the Netherlands, and others have witnessed the rise and power of similar populist leaders with wide-ranging agendas to cut government and/or radically reform it. In short, recently the electorate everywhere seem to want to “apply a stick to the backsides” and “bloody the noses” of experts! Ideally rid the world of them!This lecture will attempt to address the challenges of professionals who work in this Janus-Faced, contradictory world that both enthusiastically embraces and forcefully rejects them by examining first, what is public professionalism today? How do we define the term nowadays? What are its major foundational values?Second, what are the key political-sociological-economic trends influencing the activities and shaping actions of public professionals? Their sources and impacts? And how are these forces reshaping the work professionals perform as well as those foundational values that served in the past to create and sustain public professionalism?Finally, given these new realities of radical transformations confronting public professionals world-wide in the second decade of the 21st century, how best can teachers educate those aiming for careers as public professionals as well as advance the skills and expertise of “old hands” who are already in the public service? How can “it” be best taught, given the immense challenges governments everywhere confront?Before going further, it is important to spell out the premises behind my lecture. They are six-fold, relatively clear-cut, and simple:Government decisions and official behavior immensely impact every nation and the world as a whole by influencing society’s development, its economic prosperity, and legitimacy of democracy;The great bulk of public sector decisions, indeed THE key decisions, are determined by public professionals who are largely unelected and tenured;The quality and kinds of decisions and actions these public professionals make depend upon their skills, orientation, outlooks, and values;These professional qualities depend heavily upon their backgrounds, training, education, career development, as well as their current involvement in whatever professional associations or groups they belong;Government is composed of many professions-physicians, lawyers, engineers, etc.-and so it never can hope to become just one professional body, but rather public sector professionalization realistically involves advancing the degree of their individual influence on decision-making as well as inculcating professional values throughout many groups working in the public sector; andThe activities and challenges facing public professionals as well as the advancement of professionalism within each nation are not identical but share many of the same attributes world-wide today.Since “public professional” and “public professionalism” are frequently referred to, it is first essential to define what we are talking about here. These terms are slippery, even ambiguous and open to many interpretations and ways of thinking. Oxford English Dictionary, for example, tells us its earliest meaning derived from “professing” or someone who “professes” to know more about a subject and is better qualified to do a job as a result. “The occupation which one professes to be skilled in and to follow […] A vocation in which professional knowledge of some branch of learning is used in its application to the affairs of others, and in the practice of the art based upon it.” Originally the term “professional” was confined to the traditional callings of divinity, law, medicine, and the military. Today it applies to a far wider, more pervasive, and ever growing groups-some employed exclusively by government such as foreign service officers, city managers, police, military, and urban planners and others employed across the public, nonprofit, and private sectors who enormously influence public sector choices such as lawyers, engineers, scientists, physicians, and economists. And this does not even begin to encompass the newly emerging professions such as cyber-security and emergency disaster personnel or other many specializations and sub-specializations. Given the ever-growing numbers of specialized occupations, can these recent job categories be labelled as professionals? It is not easy to tell nor offer up clear-cut definitions. While there is no commonly agreed up meaning today of public professionals and/or professionalization of the public service, Frederick Mosher’s definition is useful, both precise and flexible enough to fit common-day understanding:[…] a more or less specialized and purposeful field of human activity which require some specialized education or training (though it may be acquired on the job), which offers a career of life work, and enjoys a relatively high status. It normally aspires to social, not selfish, purpose. Usually, but not always, it requires a degree or certification, and credential of some kind. Often its members join in a professional organization, local, state, or national, which enunciates standards and ethics of professional performance sometimes with the powers of enforcement.Note the three value components of Mosher’s definition that serve as the foundational norms of public professionals past and present: applied expertise, corporate identity, and ethical responsibility.First, and above all, public professionalism is based upon expertise. Knowledge, theoretically based but pragmatically applied to shaping directly or indirectly human affairs, serve as origins and ongoing rationale of every professional’s existence. The modern military profession grew out the creation of the formation of the nation-state in the 15th and 16th centuries that demanded trained expertise in what Harold Lasswell once characterized as “the management of violence”. The American City Manager Profession was a mundane result of what to do about potholes in city streets thanks to the newly invented automobile at the dawn of the 20th century. Staunton, Virginia hired the first city manager in 1909, Charles Ashburner, a trained civil engineer, to deal with that pothole problem. Similarly, contemporary responses to specific empirical necessities of coping with cloud computing, applying new crime-fighting CSI techniques, dealing with a sudden outbreak of a heretofore unknown medical disease, or combating the threats of Isis are likewise the cause of the origins and growth of new professions. An urbanized, industrialized, globalized, and information-driven world spawns professionalization at a rapid rate, far more rapid than ever before. Not too long ago, someone went to “an ear, nose, and throat doctor” to treat ailments related to those body parts, but nowadays a myriad of specialists subdivide work in that single area with strange unpronounceable titles such as otolaryngologists, pulmonologists, gastroenterologists, allergists, and much more. Specialization is driven by speedier accumulation of scientific knowledge that requires a subdivision of labor but it also stems from self-interest, i.e. specialized expertise is generally considered higher status and receives higher pay. But whatever the cause of narrowing specialization, according to a recent empirical study by Lotte Anderson and Lene Peterson, professionalism is negatively correlated with compassion, defined as being emotionally (empathically) based motivation to do good for others by improving public service delivery. Rather professional norms of applied expertise are the determining factor for effective service delivery performance to clients rather than the application of more humanly compassion or user friendly approaches. In short, the degree of specialized applied and theoretical knowledge and the firmness and consistence of its application remain the cornerstone of “best practices” of professionals everywhere.Second, a corporate identity forges development and expansion of professions. It also gives structure and purpose to their existence, sets boundaries for the scope and substance of any professional activity, and establishes lines of who belongs inside its ranks and who does not. It further defines and creates “professional elites” who govern and control internal “hidden hierarchies”, in the words of Corinne Gibbs. State Bar Associations or Medical Societies for traditional fields like Law and Medicine or the International City/County Managers’ Association and Society of Civil Engineers for newer careers in local public management and civil engineers provide such corporate structures in America and define the best educational practices, entrance routes, credentialing requirements, continuing training options, codes of conduct, and methods of enforcement. They serve as advocates for a profession by advancing its cause through publicity campaigns with many varieties of internet, lobbying, and hard-copy literature and disseminate knowledge through regular meetings and serious journal publications. As a recent study by Mirko Noordegraaf underscores, professionalism is developed and nurtured via “connectedness” which is advanced in three ways: between professional actions and practices, between segments and groups, and between workplaces and other spaces. Above all, professionals resist political intrusion into their work. Ironically professionals of all stripes often express hostility to anything smacking of “the political” although public professionals by definition work for government and must be ultimately responsive to elected officials. Likewise, they are keen to maintain their independence from other professional groups. Fierce rivalries inside government are frequent between neighboring professions like the repeated conflicts among army, navy, air force personnel. Often invisible to the public and little studied by scholars, these professional associations and their elites exert powerful influences over shaping modern-day professional identities and the public actions they take.Finally, ethical responsibility undergirds as every profession’s ultimate raison d’etre. Professions are rooted in moral purposes of serving others beyond selfish interests. Such moral aims are more often than not codified in written statements, explicit codes of conduct, frequently combined with enforceable mechanisms to ensure their compliance. These may be framed in ancient Hippocratic Oath of Doctors to do no harm or more recent public professional codes of ethics of the Government Finance Officers Association or the American Society for Public Administration that spell out complicated professional, moral, legal standards of conduct for association members. Though realistically the transmission of ethical norms throughout professional ranks is not a product of written documents or codes of ethics but through informal communications of what is acceptable behavior or not. Especially the role models of elites serve to set standards for “best practices”, norms of good behavior, essential training, “ideal career tracks”, and what defines success or not within the field. Conferences, in-house journals, informal discussions inculcate ethical values informally throughout the membership. As James Svara wrote recently, the essence of the articulated ethical values for public professions should stress serving “the public with respect, concern, courtesy, and responsiveness, recognizing that service to the public is beyond service to oneself.” Effective enforcement prods strong, ongoing reminders that violations have significant career consequences-both in the short term and long run. The challenges of ensuring effective ethical enforcement within every profession remain some of the most difficult, complex, and enduring issues they confront.So how are the socio-economic-political trends of today reshaping these professional foundational values for tomorrow? What are the challenges professions face world-wide in recent years? Are the core values upon which public professions were created and grew being strengthen? Or, in decline? My thesis: the traditional three values-applied expertise, corporate identity, and ethical responsibility-upon which public professionals originated and are sustained nowadays are being transformed profoundly across the planet by a series of influential, even contradictory forces. Here are several that appear prominently world-wide, serving shape and reshape the framing values of public professionalism:Populist Revolt vs. the Necessity for Expertise in the Public Sector: As was indicated at the beginning of this lecture, western democracies in recent years experienced strong reactions to unelected officials of all stripes and elected many committed to cutting or eliminating such individuals, but at the same time the demand for more government services remains unabated. How to reconcile these opposites which simultaneously reject and sustain effective government as well as the core values of neutral, objective expertise at the heart of public professionalism?Social Media vs. Sustained Expertise: In 2007 Apple launched it iPhone; late 2006 Facebook opened its doors; Google came out with the Android operating system in 2007; Amazon introduced Kindle in 2007; and Airbnb started in 2007. Thanks to social media the last decade witnessed a fundamental reshaping of individual behavior, work, commerce, finance, education, government, the economy, and yes, public professionalism. Social media asks everyone to be immediately involved, offering immediate answers to complex issues, plus making rapidly shifting demands on public officials. Yes, social media is more democratic because it allows everyone to be involved almost instantaneously, but simultaneously social media fosters “presentism” that drives out long-term thought and action. So how can public professionals who value-indeed require--long term, neutral, applied, objective expertise for problem solving cope with social media? How can they nurture applied expertise that involves thoughtful reflection and careful decision-making among those “who know best”? Given the massive data available-more information than accumulated by humans up to 2003-what is the right sort of data to identify, collect, and utilize vs. ignore and disregard? How do we know the real impact of social media on public professionals?The Pseudo-Event vs. the Real Event: Many years ago Daniel Boorstin referred to a media created event that was unreal or fake as “a pseudo-event”. The rise of social media has accelerated what now is called “fake news”. Often pseudo-events create reality that happens and has serious consequences, such as suicides, staged riots, or shootings. Yet, professionalism rests upon honest information, verifiable facts, as well as objective analysis. Sorting out truth from fiction has always been challenging for public professionals, but the expansion of social media during the last decade only exacerbates an already devilish dilemma. How can professionals discern fact from fiction today and respond appropriately in an increasingly social media saturated world?The Drive to Specialize vs. Integrated Professional Policy-Making: As was emphasized before, the drive to specialize and sub-specialize and so on is apparent within the professional ranks as new issues and new information demand new varieties of expertise. The result is what some term, “stovepipes” throughout government or little clusters of experts who talk to themselves rather than those outside their specialization, beyond their immediate agency, or wider general public. Hence, the right hand often is unaware of what the left hand is doing. Competition among professional groups such as within the defense department-army, air force, navy-further inhibits collaboration. Yet, effective public policy making requires integration across many professional fields to succeed. No professional group can go it alone in any policy-making arena. Thus the dilemma: how to foster integration and collaboration across increasingly narrow specialized and competitive professional ranks?Proliferation of Temporary Contractors vs. In-House Professionals: The recent devastating leaks in American Intelligence have all been the result of temporary contract employees such as Edward Snowden. Increased use of contractors is often justified politically for keeping costs down and cutting government employees. That is good political rhetoric, but there is little evidence to support such rationales. Instead, in the words of Hugh Heclo, we have become a “government of strangers”. As a result, there is potential for a serious erosion of a professional corporate identity due to the lack of commonly shared professional norms plus effective ethical enforcement mechanisms. Hence, the key question: how can professionalization of government as a whole advance when it is seriously challenged from within due to the rise of temporary contract workers (which in national security and law enforcement cases can jeopardize human life as well)?Global Interconnectedness vs. Local Accountability: As mentioned before, professional groups are rooted in state and community level associations such as the State Bar Association or State Medical Societies for entrance exams, credentialing, ethics enforcement, and much more. Yet, increasingly professional work spans the global or at least are interconnected beyond the borders of any single nation. Again, problem-solving demands wider international cooperation and collaboration to succeed in almost every field today from environmental protection to military intervention. Hence, how to insure that public professionals, educated and credentialed within a local jurisdiction, are prepared to see “the big picture” and work effectively with colleagues across national boundaries?Increased Ethical Responsibilities vs. Limited Ethical Training: Not very long ago, it was assumed if you studied public administration, you WERE ETHICAL! Hence, MPA programs until recently were largely devoted to training students in the “bread and butter” topics of training for the 3Es-economy, efficiency, effectiveness-via classes in organization and management, budgeting and finance, human resources management, etc. Few teachers paid much attention to ethics and the subject was largely absent from public administration curricula. While more is being done in classrooms to incorporate ethical training as well as establishing codes of conduct that are enforced by professional associations, the rapid escalation of ethical responsibilities and demands upon public officials continues to grow at a staggering rate. From first-line employee to top department head in government, ethical dilemmas are profound and pervasive. So the central, if not THE CENTRAL CHALLENGE, confronting the field today is: how to develop ethical awareness among professionals in order to make and to apply ethically sound choices for resolving problems they confront?Specialist vs. Generalist Public Service Education: Universities remain conveyor belts for advancing expertise, credentialing, and educating public professionals. Until relatively recently it was easy to name the top public administration schools, the top scholars in the field, an agreed upon means of academic preparation, and recognize a common curriculum for training throughout the field. A generalist orientation largely prepared students for a variety of public sector careers. While today university training beyond the BS or BA degree is generally accepted as the appropriate route to professional careers in government, the choice of schools, curricula, and specializations are staggering in the USA. Generalist degrees have largely declined or disappeared in favor of highly narrow subject matter such as defense policy making, emergency management training, law enforcement administration, budgeting and financial management, or human resources management. Once many of these were designated as sub-fields of a generalist MPA degree but now are offered as stand-alone graduate degrees. But does specialized training adequately prepare students for government work that requires understanding “the big picture”, how to integrate the parts, and then make them operate altogether as a “whole ball of wax”? At what point does increasing professional specialization become counterproductive to achieving “the public interest”?A Clear Dichotomy vs. An Integrated Political/Professional Team: Since the rise of democracy with elected officials and growth of bureaucracies with appointed public professions, the dilemma has always been how to “mesh” the two distinctively different realms of the political and administrative into an effective collaborative team to serve the public interest, especially since both have profoundly different incentive structures, agendas, outlooks, and purposes. The issue is as old as public administration itself; indeed, it was a major concern of Woodrow Wilson’s first essay written in America on the subject, The study of administration (1887), i.e. how to ensure responsible government in light of the creation of a new civil service system? How to make certain professionals are accountable to the public? The topic remains front and center to the public sector world-wide today, namely how can elected officials hold appointed public professionals accountable while at the same time how can professionals offer the best neutral, objective, independent advice and service to elected representatives? Everywhere in the world nowadays this issue of “marrying” political and professional is not only challenging but decides ultimately the fate of many, if not all, key public policy debates.Certainly other current world-wide trends impacting public professionalism could be added to this list, such as citizen participation, union representation in government, and career mobility. But I tried to emphasize those most recent, most critical, and with the greatest potential global impacts on the public sector. Granted, many of my examples and citations were drawn from the USA. So my perspectives and this discussion may well be somewhat limited, parochial, and even biased. I certainly know little about Brazilian public administration and the specific challenges your public service confronts, but I suspect many of the trends outlined above are effecting your nation and its public sector in equally profound, pervasive, and often unknown ways. Especially for those seminal public profession values of applied expertise, corporate identity, and ethical responsibility, my hunch is that individually and collectively these aforementioned forces serve to fragment, diffuse, even negate many aspects of foundational professional values in Brazil as well as everywhere abroad. Thus my central argument for advancing public service education is aimed to revitalize, reinvigorate, and rejuvenate those core values that created and developed public professionalism as we now know it and are under attack in many quarters. Why? Again, as emphasized in the stated premises to this lecture, government decisions and official behavior have immense impact on any nation and the world-social, political, economic-hence, it is the education of public professionals that is critical to shaping public choices and actions. Effective government and a just modern society cannot work without a professionalized public service. If Carl Friedrich once wrote that “bureaucracy is the core of modern government”, certainly “public professionals” are the core of that core.So what are the best routes for advancing public professionalism in the second decade of the 21st century and beyond? Again, I must claim ignorance about Brazil’s public service and its particular contemporary challenges. Though permit me to discuss general educational strategies in light of the nine forgoing global trends and speculate about routes that can significantly serve to strengthen and advance those three foundational professional values. Here I will sum up this talk--not by outlining specific remedies or educational programs and curricula, not arguing for part-time vs. full time alternatives, not in-house vs. university training, not online vs. in classroom face-to-face teaching-but rather by speculating on general educational strategies aimed at broadly strengthening the three seminal foundational values of public professionalism.First, by fostering greater constitutional understanding: Here I am not suggesting more legal training in the specifics of constitutional law. Rather I refer to the broader Aristotelian sense of comprehending the basic purposes, meaning, and influence on public professionals of framing legal documents for every nation. In the case of the United States Constitution, such instruction would not ask students to learn the specifics of the 6 thousand word framing document but rather to comprehend its intellectual origins in the late 18th century and why that era and the men involved fashioned a very unique founding arrangement; its central aims as embodied in its preamble that lay out possibilities, limits, and roles of today’s public sector; its general structure that shapes the current actions and constraints on modern American Government; as well as its 27 amendments since 1789 and evolving interpretations over time that influence public sector activities today. By linking greater constitutional understanding to contemporary public professional education can rejuvenate and invigorate basic ethical values that undergird all professional decision-making activities.Second, by encouraging deeper appreciation of professional history and the lives of professional leaders: Professionals live within a stream of history that runs deep and wide and decisively influences their modern corporate identities of who they are, what they do, and how they operate in the modern-day world. History can tremendously enrich professional careers, inspire their work, by knowledge of their past development, key founders, their accomplishments and, yes, failures. It can broaden their way of thinking about problems; offer examples of not just how-to-do-something, but how-to-do-it-well; what works best or not; as well as approaches and strategies that succeed-or fail. Such education would include reading about the lives of the great professional leaders: why they entered the field, how they learned their professional skills, what they learned about, experienced in their apprenticeships that fostered their career development, how they rose to prominence within the professional ranks, what inspired their deep commitment to this line of work, role models that aided their advancement, and decisions they made that made them historically famous-or infamous as professional leaders. Much of professional education requires hard work and sheer perspiration. History and biography offers invaluable inspiration for those who aspire to top leadership ranks as well as those “old hands” already in charge.Third, by grasping lessons of administrative cases: The world of government does not present its practitioners with simple questions or neat solutions. Especially as they move up in every organizational hierarchy, administrative issues become more and more complex. Professionals in government do not wake up in the morning and say, “Today I will deal with a budget issue”; “tomorrow I will address policy of such and such an area” and “the next day hiring a new employee will be my agenda”. Nothing is so neat and tidy in government. Rather, everything is usually interconnected, events come upon desks unpredictably, and choices are more often than not neither right nor wrong, but mixed with a lot grey uncertainty, without full information, and considerable questions as to the results and outcomes to be achieved. Here is where administrative cases are a necessary pedagogical tool. Unlike medical school or law school cases with often clear-cut right and wrong answers, the best administrative cases are open to many interpretations and force students to see the ambiguity and complexity of so much of what real-life government decision-making is all about. The best administrative cases encourage students to appreciate and navigate such cloudy operational environments as well as learn how successful policy-making and implementation of policy involves working across agency, departmental, and unit lines, using multiple administrative skills of budgeting and finance, human resources, planning, and so on in order to achieve results. In short, cases focusing upon gaining collaborative management skills, seeing “the big picture” beyond the limited intellectual horizons of most professional training, are vital for advancing professionalization in all parts of modern government.Finally, by studying the future: The old adage that we should study the future because that is where we spend the rest of our lives is certainly true or contains an important truth for those who work in the public sector. For better or worse-or better AND worse-virtually all government activities involve shaping the future. It may concern big choices of peace or war, or simply entail plugging numbers into a line-item budget or hiring a new employee. Such big choices or mundane tasks in the public service help to decide what tomorrow will become. The destinies of societies everywhere are the hands of public professionals who are employed throughout government, deciding on the social challenges we face, what they are, and how to confront them by making choices big and small. Though few would debate the value of knowing about the future, the question is how? Or, how to educate professionals in futuristic learning? Certainly the rise of “big data” and its world-wide immense influence on business and government planning and decision-making is apparent and fact of modern life. Thus learning to gather, comprehend, and analyze large data, separating the essential from non-essential, fact from fiction, unlocking the relevant information related to the questions at hand in order to glean future trends is invaluable for predicting the future. But other less grand routes to glimpsing the future can be found by learning how to conduct focus groups, sample expert opinion, or gather reference material from a wide variety of document sources. While certainly no one-best-way exists to properly examine where we are headed tomorrow, the most striking aspect of professional education to date is how little involves thinking about the future. Part of the problem is the popular association of futuristic studies with tea-leaf reading and casting horoscopes, activities not enthusiastically embraced by university academics-so far. But there are numerous more reputable technological-scientific methods worth at least somehow, someway incorporating into our professional training programs which include: trend extrapolation, genius forecasting, Delphic exercises, simulation, scenario building, cross-impact matrix development and much more that can help us predict and plan for tomorrow. Perhaps we cannot see the future with precision or a degree of accuracy we wish, but some guidance is better than nothing to point the way forward in order assist professionals to plan better today. Simply because we do not know how to educate for “it” or so far there is no agreed upon proper training methodology are no excuses for not trying-given that the stakes are so high for professionals working in government, indeed more generally for society’s prosperity and survival.Received: June 21, 2017; Accepted: October 26, 2017Richard Stillman II - Professor of Public Administration at University of Colorado / EUA and Former Editor-in-chief at Public Administration Review / EUA.

It contributes a pathway for conservative courses towards design culture transformation and filling gaps between them and leading breakthrough education exemplars. The course proposes a collective knowledge creation model through social constructivism and constructionism that recognises its place in time and history and allows customisation to individual upbringing. It catches up with a profession transformed beyond a digital Bauhaus manifesto that joined and revaluated physical and digital artefacts as per their environment, quality of experiences, intelligence, networks and relations. Data and findings supported pedagogy redefinition from master-apprentice and teacher-centred skill transmission models to heutagogy and paragogy. The new approach required habitus change from a traditional goods-centred discipline to human-centred focus, critical design and making, design heuristics, CDIO (conceiving, designing, implementing, operating) and STEAM (science, technology, arts, mathematics) frameworks. Participants empathetically contextualised, problem framed and solved by crossing boundaries between disciplines, institutions, industries, students' background and society. Research and practice promoted new forms of industrial design creation happening in physical and digital coexisting spaces of being. Course units evolved around an e-curriculum component working as a digital spine. Curriculum progressed from standard top-down transmission to sociotechnical and organisational networking, industry collaboration, international design studio and Design Factory model-like projects. In doing so, it became a foundation for future physical-digital industrial design artefacts, human computer interaction, machine learning, hacker culture systems, shared information, free open-source software and hardware development within a 4.0 industrial revolution.","2018","2021-06-05 11:35:50","2021-06-05 11:35:50","","154-204","","3","23","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","Publisher: Design and Technology Education Association. 16 Wellesbourne House, Walton Road, Wellesbourne, Warwickshire, CV35 9JB, UK.

The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the first pandemic experienced by a world connected through the internet. We analyzed 105+ million tweets collected between March 1 and May 15, 2020, and Weibo messages compiled between January 20 and May 15, 2020, covering six languages (English, Spanish, Arabic, French, Italian, and Chinese) and represented an estimated 2.4 billion citizens worldwide. To examine fine-grained emotions during a pandemic, we built machine learning classification models based on deep learning language models to identify emotions in social media conversations about COVID-19, including positive expressions (optimistic, thankful, and empathetic), negative expressions (pessimistic, anxious, sad, annoyed, and denial), and a complicated expression, joking, which has not been explored before. Our analysis indicates a rapid increase and a slow decline in the volume of social media conversations regarding the pandemic in all six languages. The upsurge was triggered by a combination of economic collapse and confinement measures across the regions to which all the six languages belonged except for Chinese, where only the latter drove conversations. Tweets in all analyzed languages conveyed remarkably similar emotional states as the epidemic was elevated to pandemic status, including feelings dominated by a mixture of joking with anxious/pessimistic/annoyed as the volume of conversation surged and shifted to a general increase in positive states (optimistic, thankful, and empathetic), the strongest being expressed in Arabic tweets, as the pandemic came under control.","2021","2021-06-05 11:35:50","2021-06-05 11:35:50","","","","1","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 9039411039","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Patients who perceive empathic treatment have increased satisfaction and improved outcomes. We sought to determine if an empathic SAR could be developed and used to decrease pain and fear associated with peripheral IV placement in children. Methods: We conducted a pilot study of children receiving IV placement. Participating children were randomized to interact with (1) no robot, or a commercially available 3D printed humanoid SAR robot programmed with (2) empathy or (3) distraction conditions. Children and parents completed demographic surveys, and children used an adapted validated questionnaire to rate the robot's empathy on an 8-point Likert scale. Survey scores were compared by the t-test or chi-square test. Pain and fear were measured by self-report using the FACES and FEAR scales, and video tapes were coded using the CHEOPS and FLACC. Scores were compared using repeated measures 2-way ANOVA. This trial is registered with NCT02840942. Results: Thirty-one children with an average age of 9.6 years completed the study. For all measures, mean pain and fear scores were lowest in the empathy group immediately before and after IV placement. Children were more likely to attribute characteristics of empathy to the empathic condition (Likert score 7.24 v. 4.70; p=0.012) and to report that having the empathic vs. distraction robot made the IV hurt less (7.45 vs. 4.88; p=0.026). Conclusions: Children were able to identify SAR designed to display empathic characteristics and reported it helped with IV insertion pain and fear. Mean scores of self-reported or objective pain and fear scales were the lowest in the empathy group and the highest in the distraction condition before and after IV insertion. This result suggests empathy improves SAR functionality when used for painful medical procedures and informs future research into SAR for pain management.","2020","2021-06-05 11:35:50","2021-06-05 11:35:50","","","","","2020","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8585130163","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The companionship thus established between viewer and character defines the place attributed to the implict viewer inscribed in the structure of TV narratives. When the fictional universe is posthuman, the fiction stages the issue of the robot’s ontological nature and explores its relationship with human characters by using the emotional trigger of empathy. The use of dramatic irony and empathy in Westworld reveal a multi-layered use of the Shakespearean intertext which redefines the process of reception and reshuffles the narrative treatment of the posthuman.","2018","2021-06-05 11:35:50","2021-06-05 11:35:50","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8081252866","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"WP4NEKGT","journalArticle","2015","","EEVEE: the Empathy-Enhancing Virtual Evolving Environment","Frontiers in Human Neuroscience","","1662-5161","","","Empathy is a multifaceted emotional and mental faculty that is often found to be affected in a great number of psychopathologies, including schizophrenia, yet it remains very difficult to measure in an ecological context. The challenge stems partly from the complexity and fluidity of this social process, but also from its covert nature. A powerful tool to enhance experimental control over such dynamic social interactions is the use of avatars in virtual reality (VR), and one way to collect information about an individual in an interaction is through the analysis of his or her neurophysiological and behavioural responses. We have developed a unique platform, the Empathy-Enhancing Virtual Evolving Environment (EEVEE), which is built around three main components: 1) different avatars capable of expressing feelings and emotions at various levels based on the Facial Action Coding System (FACS); 2) systems for measuring the physiological responses of the observer (heart and respiration rate, skin conductance, gaze and eye movements, facial expression); and 3) a multimodal interface linking the avatar’s behaviour to the observer’s neurophysiological response. In this article, we provide a detailed description of the components of this innovative platform and validation data from the first phases of development. Our data show that healthy adults can discriminate different negative emotions, including pain, expressed by avatars at varying intensities. We also provide evidence that masking part of an avatar’s face (top or bottom half) does not prevent the detection of different levels of pain. Overall, this innovative and flexible platform provides a unique tool to study and even modulate empathy in a comprehensive and ecological manner in number of populations suffering from neurological or psychiatric disorders.","2015","2021-06-05 11:35:50","2021-06-05 11:35:50","","","","","","","","EEVEE","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 7180498037","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In all those tasks social behavior is a key ability that needs to be systematically investigated and modelled at the lowest level, as even a minor inconsistency of the robot’s behavior can greatly affect the way humans will perceive it and react to it. Here we propose an integrated architecture for generating a socially competent robot.We validate our architecture using a humanoid robot, demonstrating that gaze, eye contact and utilitarian emotions play an essential role in the psychological validity or social salience of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI). We show that this social salience affects both the empathic bonding between the human and a humanoid robot and, to a certain extent, the attribution of a Theory of Mind (ToM). More specifically, we investigate whether these social cues affect other utilitarian aspects of the interaction such as knowledge transfer within a teaching context.","2015-07-20","2021-08-16 12:08:09","2021-08-16 12:08:09","2021-08-16 12:08:09","","","1","6","","","Towards the synthetic self","","","","","","","en","","","","","www-degruyter-com.ez.statsbiblioteket.dk:12048","","Publisher: De Gruyter Open Access Section: Paladyn, Journal of Behavioral Robotics","","C:\Users\esben\Zotero\storage\AK7E7ILN\Lallee et al. - 2015 - Towards the synthetic self making others perceive.pdf; C:\Users\esben\Zotero\storage\LWFKPTJG\html.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
