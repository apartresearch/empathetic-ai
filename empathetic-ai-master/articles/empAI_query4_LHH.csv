How should we ethically evaluate such responses to robots? Are people wrong to treat non-sentient artefacts as moral patients since this rests on anthropomorphism and ‘over-identification’ (Bryson and Kime, Proc Twenty-Second Int Jt Conf Artif Intell Barc Catalonia Spain 16–22:1641–1646, 2011)—or correct since spontaneous moral intuition and behavior toward nonhumans is indicative for moral patienthood, such that social robots become our ‘Others’ (Gunkel, Robot rights, MIT Press, London, 2018; Coeckelbergh, Kairos J Philos Sci 20:141–158, 2018)?. In this research paper, I weave extant HRI studies that demonstrate empathic responses toward robots with the recent debate on moral status for robots, on which the ethical evaluation of moral behavior toward them is dependent. Patienthood for robots has standardly been thought to obtain on some intrinsic ground, such as being sentient, conscious, or having interest. But since these attempts neglect moral experience and are curbed by epistemic difficulties, I take inspiration from Coeckelbergh and Gunkel’s ‘relational approach’ to explore an alternative way of accounting for robot patienthood based on extrinsic premises. Based on the ethics of Danish theologian K. E. Løgstrup (1905–1981) I argue that empathic responses can be interpreted as sovereign expressions of life and that these expressions benefit human subjects—even if they emerge from social interaction afforded by robots we have anthropomorphized. I ultimately develop an argument in defense of treating robots as moral patients.","2022-06","2022-07-15 08:52:46","2022-07-15 08:52:46","","535–548","","2","37","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: Berlin, Heidelberg Publisher: Springer-Verlag","","","","Empathy; Ethics; K.

Therefore, in this study, we aimed to improve the human impression of the robot using a robot that expresses human-like expressions by synchronizing with human biological information and changing the expressions in real time. We first measured and estimated human emotions using an emotion estimation method based on biological information (brain waves and heartbeats). The three-emotion estimation methods were proposed and evaluated in the preliminary experiment. Among the three-emotion estimation methods proposed, the one that yields the highest impression rating was chosen to be used in the second experiment which was based on the emotional value in each cycle method. Then, we developed a robot that shows expressions in two patterns: (1) synchronized emotion (same emotion as subject conveyed) and (2) inversed emotion with the human. The subjects evaluated the robot’s expression from both patterns using semantic differential (SD) method while having their biological information measured based on the selected emotion estimation method from previous preliminary experiment. The evaluation by SD method and biological information results showed that when the human experienced the happiness emotion, and the robot synchronized and expressed the same emotion, this could increase the intimacy between human and robot. Here, it can be said that the impression created by the robot’s expression can be improved using biological information.","2021-11","2022-07-15 08:52:46","2022-07-15 08:52:46","","379–389","","4","26","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: Berlin, Heidelberg Publisher: Springer-Verlag","","","","Biological information; Emotion analysis; Emotion estimation; Empathetic robot; Robot expression","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Modern robots can use their sensors, like cameras and microphones, not only for their more traditional goals, but also for classifying human emotional states in order to emulate an empathic behavior, and to put the users at ease and tempt them in continuing the interaction. They can offer a human-like communication occurring over different verbal and non-verbal communication channels.

It has been argued that empathy has a strong effect on behavior inducement. In human-human interaction, it has been verified that the influence of a nonverbal cue on empathy outweighs that of a verbal cue when those are used in a combined way. The objectives of this study are to explore if such outweighing effect of nonverbal cues is maintained in human-robot interaction (HRI) and to investigate the mechanism of communication cues’ effects by analyzing the mediation structure with the following mediator variables: perceived emotion, perceived intentionality, perceived malfunction, and empathy inducement. To this end, we conducted 2 (verbal type: positive verbal cue vs. negative verbal cue) × 2 (nonverbal type: positive nonverbal cue vs. negative nonverbal cue) within-participant experiment (N = 48). The experiment created a situation in which the social robot was harshly criticized during a conversation. The analysis of experiment results showed the outweighing effect of a nonverbal cue was maintained. When a nonverbal cue conveyed a negative, situation-accordant emotion, it had a decisive effect on perceived emotion, empathy, and behavior inducement. In contrast, a verbal cue induced participants’ empathy and behavior when it conveyed a positive, situation-discordant emotion. This inconsistency between verbal cue and nonverbal cue made the combination of positive verbal cue and negative nonverbal cue have the strongest effect. It implies that participants had different expectations for each of the two communication cues, just as they did in social interactions with human beings. It implies that participants might have applied normative expectations for social interaction with human beings to the social robot.","2021","2022-07-15 08:52:46","2022-07-15 08:52:46","","854–861","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Press","","","","","","","","","event-place: Prague, Czech Republic","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Consequently, the failure of robots to be perceived as empathetic by human users could be detrimental to developing effective human-robot interaction. Work on computational models of empathy has been growing rapidly, reflecting the importance of this ability for machines. Despite growing recent work, there remain unanswered questions about how users perceive different forms of empathetic expression by robots and how attitudes towards robots may mediate perceptions of robot empathy. Do people really believe that robots can feel or understand emotions? This work studied the difference in viewers' perceptions of cognitive and affective empathetic statements made by a robot in response to human disclosure. In a within-subjects study, participants (n=111) watched videos in which a human disclosed negative emotions around COVID-19, and a robot responded with either affective or cognitive empathetic responses. Using an adapted version of the Robot's Perceived Empathy (RoPE) scale, participants rated their perceptions of the robot's empathy in both cases. We found that participants perceived the robot that made affective empathetic statements as being more empathetic that the robot that made cognitive empathetic statements; we also found that participants with more negative attitudes toward robots were more likely to rate the cognitive condition as more empathetic than the affective condition. These results inform HRI in general and future work into developing robots that will be perceived as empathetic and could personalize empathetic responses to each user.","2022","2022-07-15 08:52:46","2022-07-15 08:52:46","","323–331","","","","","","","HRI '22","","","","IEEE Press","","","","","","","","","event-place: Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan","","","","empathy; human-robot interaction; socially assistive robotics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We also explored whether participants who report more empathic tendencies experienced more emotional contagion when watching Cozmo's emotional displays, since emotion contagion is a core aspect of empathy. We tested participants' perceptions of Cozmo's happiness, anger, sadness, surprise, and neutral displays. Across 103 participants, we report high recognition rates for most emotion categories except neutral animations. Furthermore, the mixed effects modelling revealed that an empathy subtype (the empathic concern subscale from the Interpersonal Reactivity Index) significantly impacted emotional contagion. Contrary to predictions, participants with high empathic concern subscale scores were less likely to find the robot's videos emotionally contagious. The study validates the utility of Cozmo robots to display emotional cues recognizable to human users, and further suggests that empathic traits could shape our affective interactions with robots, though perhaps in a counterintuitive way.","2022","2022-07-15 08:52:46","2022-07-15 08:52:46","","802–806","","","","","","","HRI '22","","","","IEEE Press","","","","","","","","","event-place: Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan","","","","dispositional empathy; emotion contagion; emotion recognition; human-robot interaction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Designed for long-term emotional engagement and to take the roles of friends, teachers, and babysitters, such robots have the potential to influence how children develop empathy. This article presents a review of the literature (2010–2020) in the fields of human–robot interaction (HRI), psychology, neuropsychology, and roboethics, discussing the potential impact of communication with social robots on children’s social and emotional development. The critical analysis of evidence behind these discussions shows that, although robots theoretically have high chances of influencing the development of empathy in children, depending on their design, intensity, and context of use, there is no certainty about the kind of effect they might have. Most of the analyzed studies, which showed the ability of robots to improve empathy levels in children, were not longitudinal, while the studies observing and arguing for the negative effect of robots on children’s empathy were either purely theoretical or dependent on the specific design of the robot and the situation. Therefore, there is a need for studies investigating the effects on children’s social and emotional development of long-term regular and consistent communication with robots of various designs and in different situations.","2022-06","2022-07-15 08:52:46","2022-07-15 08:52:46","","579–589","","2","37","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: Berlin, Heidelberg Publisher: Springer-Verlag","","","","Children; Cognitive empathy; Communication; Early childhood; Empathy development; Social robots","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

From an organizational perspective, AI devices have several advantages, by performing certain tasks quicker and more accurately in comparison to humans while at the same time being more cost-efficient. However, in order to maintain the high standards of a brand, they have to be accepted by consumers and deliver socially adequate performance. Therefore, it is important to determine the characteristics of AI devices which make them accepted and trusted by consumers. Based on the Computers as Social Actors (CASA) Theory, we have researched on the role of psychological anthropomorphic characteristics, perceived empathy, and interaction quality in the acceptance of AI devices in the service industry. The results show that anthropomorphic characteristics alone do not influence acceptance and trust towards AI devices. However, both perceived empathy and interaction quality mediate the relation between anthropomorphic characteristics and acceptance. A human-like AI device has higher acceptance when it has the ability to show empathy and interaction in relation to the human consumer. This result reveals the importance of developing forms of strong intelligence and empathetic behaviour in service robots and AI devices.","2021","2022-07-15 09:02:33","2022-07-15 09:02:33","","106855","","","122","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","AI device; Anthropomorphism; Artificial intelligence; Computers as social actors; Consumer behaviour; Human-AI interaction; Human-computer interaction; Robots","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods Using transcripts from 353 primary care office visits with 350 patients and 84 physicians (Cook, 2002 [1], Tai-Seale et al., 2015 [2]), we developed two machine learning models (a recurrent neural network with a hierarchical structure and a logistic regression classifier) to recognize the emotional valence (positive, negative, neutral) (Posner et al., 2005 [3]) of each utterance. We examined the agreement of human-generated ratings of emotional valence with machine learning model ratings of emotion. Results The agreement of emotion ratings from the recurrent neural network model with human ratings was comparable to that of human-human inter-rater agreement. The weighted-average of the correlation coefficients for the recurrent neural network model with human raters was 0.60, and the human rater agreement was also 0.60.

The best performing pessimism and optimism detection models are based on bidirectional long- and short-term memory networks. Experimental results on four periods of the COVID-19 pandemic show how the proposed approach can model optimism and pessimism in the context of a health crisis. There is a total of 150,503 tweets and 51,319 unique users. Conversations are characterised in terms of emotional signals and shifts to unravel empathy and support mechanisms. Conversations with stronger pessimistic signals denoted little emotional shift (i.e. 62.21% of these conversations experienced almost no change in emotion). In turn, only 10.42% of the conversations laying more on the optimistic side maintained the mood.

Previous studies have shown that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is effective in improving attention deficit symptoms. However, many patients are not receiving adequate treatment due to time, space, and cost constraints. Recently, in other mental illnesses, mobile-based chatbots delivering CBT and psychoeducation have been used for symptom mitigation and treatment. Objective This study aimed to investigate the feasibility and usability of a short-term intervention, specifically a mobile-based interactive chatbot application, in alleviating attention deficit symptoms. Methods This was a randomized, non-blind parallel-group pilot study conducted from September 2019 to March 2020. Forty-six individuals with attention deficit aged 19–60 were randomly allocated to the chatbot (n = 23) and information-only control groups (n = 23) for 4 weeks. The former group was instructed to use the chatbot application “Todaki,” while the latter group was provided with a book on managing attention deficit symptoms. Participants were administered questionnaires to assess their symptoms of attention deficit, depression, and anxiety and evaluated at baseline and 4 weeks after the intervention. The post-intervention survey assessed the chatbot’s usability, acceptability, and side effects. Results The average age of the participants was 25.1 years (standard deviation [SD] 7.5 years), and 56.5 % (26/46) participants were female. Intention-to-treat analysis (chatbot, n = 23; control, n = 23) revealed a significant reduction of attention deficit symptoms only in the chatbot group, which is represented by group-by-time interaction in Conner’s Adult ADHD Rating Scale subscales of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-IV Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Hyperactive-Impulsive symptoms (F = 4.39; p = .04) and ADHD symptoms total (F = 6.74, p = .01). Further, the results of the paired t-test were significant only in the chatbot group. The average number of times the chatbots were used in 4 weeks was 20.32 (SD 12.89). The total average usage time was 1 h 15 min (SD 1 h 20 min). The degree of improvement in the ADHD symptoms total score was correlated with the number of times the psychoeducation program was used. According to the participants, the empathic/friendly character and unnatural flow of conversation were the best and worst features of the chatbot, respectively. Conclusions This study identified the feasibility and usability of using the mobile-based chatbot to improve attention deficit and its associated psychiatric symptoms. Using this novel intervention to conduct CBT would provide a useful digital therapeutic tool that allows easy accessibility and self-guided management for people with attention deficit, which should be verified through the large scale randomized controlled trial.","2021","2022-07-15 09:02:33","2022-07-15 09:02:33","","104440","","","150","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Attention deficit; attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; Chatbot; Cognitive behavioral therapy; Conversational agent; mobile app; Psychoeducation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This article focuses on AI service recovery, abandoning the traditional “intelligence quotient” thinking and exploring the recovery effect of empathy response from the perspective of emotional intelligence. Using four experimental scenarios, the results indicate that, in service recovery, a high-empathy AI response can increase customers’ continuous usage intention, and psychological distance and trust are sequential mediators in this process. Compared with mono-sensory stimulus interactions (text only), a high-empathy response that adopts multisensory stimulus interactions (text and voice) could strengthen the recovery effect of empathy responses. This paper extends the field of AI service research from a focus on time and phase to the continuing use of AI after service failure. It also moves beyond the traditional intelligence quotient improvement thinking and reveals the importance of using AI emotional intelligence to activate customer emotional response in AI service recovery. Finally, it provides a useful tool for resolving AI service failure problems autonomously in the service process, which is of great value to research and development and hospitality operators in the promotion and application of AI services.","2022","2022-07-15 09:02:33","2022-07-15 09:02:33","","106993","","","126","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Artificial intelligence (AI); Continuous usage intention; Emotional intelligence; Empathy; Service recovery","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While many studies have investigated voice attributes for robots, not much is known about the effect voice naturalness has on the perception of realistic virtual characters. We conducted the first experiment in Virtual Reality (VR) with over two hundred participants investigating the mismatch between realistic appearance and unrealistic voice on the feeling of presence, and the emotional response of the user to the character expressing a strong negative emotion. We predicted that the mismatched voice would lower social presence and cause users to have a negative emotional reaction and feelings of discomfort towards the character. We found that the concern for the virtual character was indeed altered by the unnatural voice, though interestingly it did not affect social presence. The second experiment was conducted with a view towards heightening the appearance realism of the same character for the same scenarios, with an additional lower level of voice realism employed to strengthen the mismatch of perceptual cues. While voice type did not appear to impact reports of empathic responses towards the character, there was an observed effect of voice realism on reported social presence, which was not detected in the first study. There were also significant results on affinity and voice trait measurements that provide evidence in support of perceptual mismatch theories of the Uncanny Valley.","2022","2022-07-15 09:02:33","2022-07-15 09:02:33","","116-128","","","104","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Perception; Synthetic voice; Virtual humans; Virtual reality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Digital health technologies are at the forefront of this transition in facilitating a role for the patient in the clinical dimensions of the healthcare trajectory, from diagnosis and interventions to treatment and recovery. Despite this prevalence in the clinical space, the non-clinical needs of patient mental health and wellbeing are frequently overlooked by contemporary patient-centered healthcare models. Conversational agents (or chatbots) are digital dialogue systems that are widespread and widely used in sequential information provision and information acquisition tasks. Given the intimate nature of this human-machine interaction, conversational agents can be effectively utilized to support and sustain patient mental health and wellbeing. In this paper, we propose an empathic conversational agent framework based on an ensemble of natural language processing techniques and artificial intelligence algorithms for real-time monitoring and co-facilitation of patient-centered healthcare for improved mental health and wellbeing outcomes. The technical contributions of this framework are; detection of patient emotions, prediction of patient emotion transitions, detection of group emotions, formulation of patient behavioral metrics, and resource recommendations based on patient concerns. The architectural contributions of the framework are intelligent communication channels that stream empathic conversational elements and resource recommendations for the multi-user conversations and co-facilitation updates for the human healthcare provider interface. The framework was empirically evaluated on a benchmark dataset and further validated based on a clinical protocol designed for its application in an online support group setting for cancer patients and caregivers in Canada. The results of these experiments confirm the effectiveness of this framework, its contributory role and practical value in realizing a patient-centered healthcare model for improved mental health and wellbeing outcomes.","2022","2022-07-15 09:02:33","2022-07-15 09:02:33","","318-329","","","126","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Artificial intelligence; Cancer care; Chatbots; Co-facilitation; Conversational agents; Empathic AI; Group emotions; Human-centric AI; Markov models; Patient emotions; Patient-centered care; Real-time monitoring","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We conducted a laboratory experiment in which participants interacted either with a diagnostic chatbot only or with an additional telemedicine professional before we interviewed them primarily on trust-building factors. We identified numerous software-related, user-related, and environment-related factors and derived a model of the initial trust-building process. The results support our assumption that it is equally essential to consider dimensions of physician and technology trust. One significant finding is that trust in a chatbot arises cognitively, while trusting a human agent is affect-based. We argue that the lack of affect-based trust inhibits the willingness to rely on diagnostic chatbots and facilitates the user's desire to keep control. Considering dimensions from doctor-patient trust, we found evidence that a chatbot's communication competencies are more important than empathic reactions as the latter may evoke incredibility feelings. To verify our findings, we applied the derived code system in a larger online survey.","2022","2022-07-15 09:02:33","2022-07-15 09:02:33","","102848","","","165","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Anthropomorphism; Chatbot; Conversational agent; mHealth; Telemedicine; Trust","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent studies about pain empathy for robots found humans present similar empathy process towards humanoid robots under painful stimuli as well as to humans. However, the whole-brain functional connectivity and the spatial dynamics of neural activities underlying empathic processes are still unknown. In the present study, the functional connectivity was investigated for ERPs recorded from 18 healthy adults who were presented with pictures of human hand and robot hand under painful and non-painful situations. Functional brain networks for both early and late empathy responses were constructed and a new parameter, empathy index (EI), was proposed to represent the empathy ability of humans quantitatively. We found that the mutual dependences between early ERP components was significantly decreased, but for the late components, there were no significant changes. The mutual dependences for human hand stimuli were larger than to robot hand stimuli for early components, but not for late components. The connectivity weights for early components were larger than late components. EI value shows significant difference between painful and non-painful stimuli, indicating it is a good indicator to represent the empathy of humans. This study enriches our understanding of the neurological mechanisms implicated in human empathy, and provides evidence of functional connectivity for both early and late responses of pain empathy towards humans and robots.","2021","2022-07-15 09:02:33","2022-07-15 09:02:33","","107695","","","151","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EEG; Empathy; Empathy index; Functional connectivity; Human-robot interaction; Mutual information","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Paul Ekman has demonstrated that we can estimate emotions on the basis of individual facial muscles movements. However, there is a lack of information in the literature about correlation between eye movements and facial emotions. Our objective was to find out whether emotion could be also visible in the dynamical properties of the eye movements. Methods. We have performed our experiment in two sessions related to different video presentations: 1) a reference session with all emotions presentation, and 2) the main session showing presentation of some specific emotions. During both sessions, we have video recordings of the subjects’ face expressions (FE) and eye movements (EM). We have calculated parameters of FE and EM dynamical changes and content of the noise. On this basis, by using time changes of EM, we have predicted 6 different face emotions. Results. We have recorded face expressions of 49 subjects who had the strongest responses to Happiness and Contempt facial emotions. We found statistically significant differences in parameters’ values describing FE and EM between the reference and the main sessions trials. Parameters connected to the Chaos showed highly positive correlations with Happiness, while both the Linear and the Noise components were mostly negatively correlated with this emotion. We achieved highest results with help of the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm obtaining: Accuracy of 0.89 (+/- 0.01) with the ROC-AUC score of 0.88 (F1 = 0.89), Precision = 0.85, Sensitivity / Recall = 0.93, Specificity = 0.82. Conclusions. We have observed that when the intensity of the Happiness increases, the eye movements become more chaotic and behave less noisy.

AR/MR-based remote collaboration on physical tasks has recently become more prominent in academic research and engineering applications. It has great potential in many fields, such as real-time remote medical consultation, education, training, maintenance, remote assistance in engineering, and other remote collaborative tasks. However, to the best of our knowledge there has not been any comprehensive review of research in AR/MR remote collaboration on physical tasks. Therefore, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of research between 2000 and 2018 in this domain. We collected 215 papers, more than 80% of which were published between 2010 and 2018, and all relevant works are discussed at length. Then we elaborate on the review from typical architectures, applications (e.g., industry, telemedicine, architecture, teleducation and others), and empathic computing. Next, we made an in-depth review of the papers from seven aspects: (1) collection and classification research, (2) using 3D scene reconstruction environments and live panorama, (3) periodicals and conducting research, (4) local and remote user interfaces, (5) features of user interfaces commonly used, (6) architecture and sharing non-verbal cues, (7) applications and toolkits. We find that most papers (160 articles, 74.4%) are published in conferences, using co-located collaboration to emulate remote collaboration is adopted by more than half (126, 58.6%) of the reviewed papers, the shared non-verbal cues can be mainly classified into five types (Virtual Replicas or Physical Proxy(VRP), AR Annotations or a Cursor Pointer(ARACP), avatar, gesture, and gaze), the local/remote interface is mainly divided into four categories (Head-Mounted Displays(HMD), Spatial Augmented Reality(SAR), Windows-Icon-Menu-Pointer(WIMP) and Hand-Held Displays(HHD)). From this, we can draw ten conclusions. Following this we report on issues for future works. The paper also provides an overall academic roadmap and useful insight into the state-of-the-art of AR/MR remote collaboration on physical tasks. This work will be useful for current and future researchers who are interested in collaborative AR/MR systems.","2021","2022-07-15 09:02:34","2022-07-15 09:02:34","","102071","","","72","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Augmented Reality; Computer-supported collaborative work; Human-computer interaction; Mixed Reality; Physical tasks; Remote collaboration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although the replacement of human counsellors remains a speculative prospect, chatbots for ‘narrow AI’ tasks (e.g., assessment and referral) are increasingly being used to augment clinical practice. Little research has addressed the possibilities for care that chatbots may generate in the future, particularly in the context of alcohol and other drug counselling. To explore these issues, we draw on the concept of technological ‘affordances’ and identify the range of possibilities for care that emerging chatbot interventions may afford and foreclose depending on the contexts in which they are implemented. Our analysis is based on qualitative data from interviews with clients (n=20) and focus group discussions with counsellors (n=8) conducted as part of a larger study of an Australian online alcohol and other drug counselling service. Both clients and counsellors expressed a concern that chatbot interventions lacked a ‘human’ element, which they valued in empathic care encounters. Most clients reported that they would share less information with a chatbot than a human counsellor, and they viewed this as constraining care. However, clients and counsellors suggested that the use of narrow AI might afford possibilities for performing discrete tasks, such as screening, triage or referral. In the context of what we refer to as ‘more-than-human’ care, our findings reveal complex views about the types of affordances that chatbots may produce and foreclose in online care encounters. We conclude by discussing implications for the potential ‘addiction futures’ and care trajectories that AI technologies offer, focussing on how they might inform alcohol and other drug policy, and the design of digital healthcare.","2021","2022-07-15 09:02:34","2022-07-15 09:02:34","","102910","","","94","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Addiction; Affordances; Artificial intelligence; Australia; Chatbots; Online care","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Furthermore, customer task orientation negatively moderates the mediating effect of empathy perception that underlies the relationship between service proactivity and customers’ co-creation intention.

From an organizational perspective, AI devices have several advantages, by performing certain tasks quicker and more accurately in comparison to humans while at the same time being more cost-efficient. However, in order to maintain the high standards of a brand, they have to be accepted by consumers and deliver socially adequate performance. Therefore, it is important to determine the characteristics of AI devices which make them accepted and trusted by consumers. Based on the Computers as Social Actors (CASA) Theory, we have researched on the role of psychological anthropomorphic characteristics, perceived empathy, and interaction quality in the acceptance of AI devices in the service industry. The results show that anthropomorphic characteristics alone do not influence acceptance and trust towards AI devices. However, both perceived empathy and interaction quality mediate the relation between anthropomorphic characteristics and acceptance. A human-like AI device has higher acceptance when it has the ability to show empathy and interaction in relation to the human consumer. This result reveals the importance of developing forms of strong intelligence and empathetic behaviour in service robots and AI devices.","2021","2022-07-15 09:03:12","2022-07-15 09:03:12","","106855","","","122","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","AI device; Anthropomorphism; Artificial intelligence; Computers as social actors; Consumer behaviour; Human-AI interaction; Human-computer interaction; Robots","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, as the opportunities offered by technology and artificial intelligence increase, digital assistants can also provide emotional support, which refers to empathetic, reassuring expressions for customers who have failed or succeeded in fulfilling a task. We show across four experiments that emotional support offered by a digital assistant increases customer satisfaction (Study 1 and 2) and persistence (Study 3 and 4) in using technology-mediated services. The increase in satisfaction occurs via the perceived warmth of the digital assistant, and the increase in persistence via the serial mediation of perceived warmth and satisfaction. Further, the results of a moderated serial mediation show that the effect on persistence only occurs when a digital (but not when a human) assistant provides emotional support in technology-mediated services. Finally, the effect of emotional support on persistence occurs independently of the digital assistant's embodiment. Practitioners learn how to imbue technology-mediated services with a human touch, inducing favorable customer outcomes.","2021","2022-07-15 09:03:12","2022-07-15 09:03:12","","176-193","","1","38","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Customer satisfaction; Digital assistants; Emotional support; Perceived warmth; Persistence","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This article focuses on AI service recovery, abandoning the traditional “intelligence quotient” thinking and exploring the recovery effect of empathy response from the perspective of emotional intelligence. Using four experimental scenarios, the results indicate that, in service recovery, a high-empathy AI response can increase customers’ continuous usage intention, and psychological distance and trust are sequential mediators in this process. Compared with mono-sensory stimulus interactions (text only), a high-empathy response that adopts multisensory stimulus interactions (text and voice) could strengthen the recovery effect of empathy responses. This paper extends the field of AI service research from a focus on time and phase to the continuing use of AI after service failure. It also moves beyond the traditional intelligence quotient improvement thinking and reveals the importance of using AI emotional intelligence to activate customer emotional response in AI service recovery. Finally, it provides a useful tool for resolving AI service failure problems autonomously in the service process, which is of great value to research and development and hospitality operators in the promotion and application of AI services.","2022","2022-07-15 09:03:12","2022-07-15 09:03:12","","106993","","","126","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Artificial intelligence (AI); Continuous usage intention; Emotional intelligence; Empathy; Service recovery","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Situating the therapeutic, zoomorphic robot, Paro and the health care support robot, Care-O-Bot as part of empathetic arrangements draws attention to how the cultivation of empathy towards robots governs and regulates patient sociality.

While many studies have investigated voice attributes for robots, not much is known about the effect voice naturalness has on the perception of realistic virtual characters. We conducted the first experiment in Virtual Reality (VR) with over two hundred participants investigating the mismatch between realistic appearance and unrealistic voice on the feeling of presence, and the emotional response of the user to the character expressing a strong negative emotion. We predicted that the mismatched voice would lower social presence and cause users to have a negative emotional reaction and feelings of discomfort towards the character. We found that the concern for the virtual character was indeed altered by the unnatural voice, though interestingly it did not affect social presence. The second experiment was conducted with a view towards heightening the appearance realism of the same character for the same scenarios, with an additional lower level of voice realism employed to strengthen the mismatch of perceptual cues. While voice type did not appear to impact reports of empathic responses towards the character, there was an observed effect of voice realism on reported social presence, which was not detected in the first study. There were also significant results on affinity and voice trait measurements that provide evidence in support of perceptual mismatch theories of the Uncanny Valley.","2022","2022-07-15 09:03:12","2022-07-15 09:03:12","","116-128","","","104","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Perception; Synthetic voice; Virtual humans; Virtual reality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods Using transcripts from 353 primary care office visits with 350 patients and 84 physicians (Cook, 2002 [1], Tai-Seale et al., 2015 [2]), we developed two machine learning models (a recurrent neural network with a hierarchical structure and a logistic regression classifier) to recognize the emotional valence (positive, negative, neutral) (Posner et al., 2005 [3]) of each utterance. We examined the agreement of human-generated ratings of emotional valence with machine learning model ratings of emotion. Results The agreement of emotion ratings from the recurrent neural network model with human ratings was comparable to that of human-human inter-rater agreement. The weighted-average of the correlation coefficients for the recurrent neural network model with human raters was 0.60, and the human rater agreement was also 0.60.

The best performing pessimism and optimism detection models are based on bidirectional long- and short-term memory networks. Experimental results on four periods of the COVID-19 pandemic show how the proposed approach can model optimism and pessimism in the context of a health crisis. There is a total of 150,503 tweets and 51,319 unique users. Conversations are characterised in terms of emotional signals and shifts to unravel empathy and support mechanisms. Conversations with stronger pessimistic signals denoted little emotional shift (i.e. 62.21% of these conversations experienced almost no change in emotion). In turn, only 10.42% of the conversations laying more on the optimistic side maintained the mood.

Given that chatbot services infused with domain knowledge are of great interest to not only global businesses but also academics, chatbots have in recent years become a popular research topic in the field of natural language processing. We therefore aim at improving current chatbots with the addition of natural emotions. In contrast to previous work, we intend to distinguish fine-grained emotion differences between words in order to better understand emotion expressions in sentences. Our approach infuses fine-grained emotion content into the response generation process to make the dialog more emotionally resonant. The experimental results demonstrate that this method can classify emotions more effectively. In addition, the proposed hybrid model, which consists of recurrent and convolutional neural networks with additional emotion-specific valence-arousal features, can correctly identify five emotions with a 67.89% overall F1-score. We further evaluate the subjective quality of the responses and discover that the infusion of fine-grained emotion information substantially improves the quality and fluency of automatically generated empathetic conversation.

Previous studies have shown that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is effective in improving attention deficit symptoms. However, many patients are not receiving adequate treatment due to time, space, and cost constraints. Recently, in other mental illnesses, mobile-based chatbots delivering CBT and psychoeducation have been used for symptom mitigation and treatment. Objective This study aimed to investigate the feasibility and usability of a short-term intervention, specifically a mobile-based interactive chatbot application, in alleviating attention deficit symptoms. Methods This was a randomized, non-blind parallel-group pilot study conducted from September 2019 to March 2020. Forty-six individuals with attention deficit aged 19–60 were randomly allocated to the chatbot (n = 23) and information-only control groups (n = 23) for 4 weeks. The former group was instructed to use the chatbot application “Todaki,” while the latter group was provided with a book on managing attention deficit symptoms. Participants were administered questionnaires to assess their symptoms of attention deficit, depression, and anxiety and evaluated at baseline and 4 weeks after the intervention. The post-intervention survey assessed the chatbot’s usability, acceptability, and side effects. Results The average age of the participants was 25.1 years (standard deviation [SD] 7.5 years), and 56.5 % (26/46) participants were female. Intention-to-treat analysis (chatbot, n = 23; control, n = 23) revealed a significant reduction of attention deficit symptoms only in the chatbot group, which is represented by group-by-time interaction in Conner’s Adult ADHD Rating Scale subscales of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-IV Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Hyperactive-Impulsive symptoms (F = 4.39; p = .04) and ADHD symptoms total (F = 6.74, p = .01). Further, the results of the paired t-test were significant only in the chatbot group. The average number of times the chatbots were used in 4 weeks was 20.32 (SD 12.89). The total average usage time was 1 h 15 min (SD 1 h 20 min). The degree of improvement in the ADHD symptoms total score was correlated with the number of times the psychoeducation program was used. According to the participants, the empathic/friendly character and unnatural flow of conversation were the best and worst features of the chatbot, respectively. Conclusions This study identified the feasibility and usability of using the mobile-based chatbot to improve attention deficit and its associated psychiatric symptoms. Using this novel intervention to conduct CBT would provide a useful digital therapeutic tool that allows easy accessibility and self-guided management for people with attention deficit, which should be verified through the large scale randomized controlled trial.","2021","2022-07-15 09:03:12","2022-07-15 09:03:12","","104440","","","150","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Attention deficit; attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; Chatbot; Cognitive behavioral therapy; Conversational agent; mobile app; Psychoeducation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Digital health technologies are at the forefront of this transition in facilitating a role for the patient in the clinical dimensions of the healthcare trajectory, from diagnosis and interventions to treatment and recovery. Despite this prevalence in the clinical space, the non-clinical needs of patient mental health and wellbeing are frequently overlooked by contemporary patient-centered healthcare models. Conversational agents (or chatbots) are digital dialogue systems that are widespread and widely used in sequential information provision and information acquisition tasks. Given the intimate nature of this human-machine interaction, conversational agents can be effectively utilized to support and sustain patient mental health and wellbeing. In this paper, we propose an empathic conversational agent framework based on an ensemble of natural language processing techniques and artificial intelligence algorithms for real-time monitoring and co-facilitation of patient-centered healthcare for improved mental health and wellbeing outcomes. The technical contributions of this framework are; detection of patient emotions, prediction of patient emotion transitions, detection of group emotions, formulation of patient behavioral metrics, and resource recommendations based on patient concerns. The architectural contributions of the framework are intelligent communication channels that stream empathic conversational elements and resource recommendations for the multi-user conversations and co-facilitation updates for the human healthcare provider interface. The framework was empirically evaluated on a benchmark dataset and further validated based on a clinical protocol designed for its application in an online support group setting for cancer patients and caregivers in Canada. The results of these experiments confirm the effectiveness of this framework, its contributory role and practical value in realizing a patient-centered healthcare model for improved mental health and wellbeing outcomes.","2022","2022-07-15 09:03:12","2022-07-15 09:03:12","","318-329","","","126","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Artificial intelligence; Cancer care; Chatbots; Co-facilitation; Conversational agents; Empathic AI; Group emotions; Human-centric AI; Markov models; Patient emotions; Patient-centered care; Real-time monitoring","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Drawing on the assumption that chatbots are perceived as both technological tools and social actors, we aim to create a deep understanding of trust-building processes towards diagnostic chatbots compared to trust in medical professionals. We conducted a laboratory experiment in which participants interacted either with a diagnostic chatbot only or with an additional telemedicine professional before we interviewed them primarily on trust-building factors. We identified numerous software-related, user-related, and environment-related factors and derived a model of the initial trust-building process. The results support our assumption that it is equally essential to consider dimensions of physician and technology trust. One significant finding is that trust in a chatbot arises cognitively, while trusting a human agent is affect-based. We argue that the lack of affect-based trust inhibits the willingness to rely on diagnostic chatbots and facilitates the user's desire to keep control. Considering dimensions from doctor-patient trust, we found evidence that a chatbot's communication competencies are more important than empathic reactions as the latter may evoke incredibility feelings. To verify our findings, we applied the derived code system in a larger online survey.","2022","2022-07-15 09:03:12","2022-07-15 09:03:12","","102848","","","165","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Anthropomorphism; Chatbot; Conversational agent; mHealth; Telemedicine; Trust","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous neuroimaging studies have indicated that neural responses of empathy for others' pain are modulated by an early automatic emotional sharing and a late controlled cognitive evaluation process. Recent studies about pain empathy for robots found humans present similar empathy process towards humanoid robots under painful stimuli as well as to humans. However, the whole-brain functional connectivity and the spatial dynamics of neural activities underlying empathic processes are still unknown. In the present study, the functional connectivity was investigated for ERPs recorded from 18 healthy adults who were presented with pictures of human hand and robot hand under painful and non-painful situations. Functional brain networks for both early and late empathy responses were constructed and a new parameter, empathy index (EI), was proposed to represent the empathy ability of humans quantitatively. We found that the mutual dependences between early ERP components was significantly decreased, but for the late components, there were no significant changes. The mutual dependences for human hand stimuli were larger than to robot hand stimuli for early components, but not for late components. The connectivity weights for early components were larger than late components. EI value shows significant difference between painful and non-painful stimuli, indicating it is a good indicator to represent the empathy of humans. This study enriches our understanding of the neurological mechanisms implicated in human empathy, and provides evidence of functional connectivity for both early and late responses of pain empathy towards humans and robots.","2021","2022-07-15 09:03:12","2022-07-15 09:03:12","","107695","","","151","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EEG; Empathy; Empathy index; Functional connectivity; Human-robot interaction; Mutual information","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Paul Ekman has demonstrated that we can estimate emotions on the basis of individual facial muscles movements. However, there is a lack of information in the literature about correlation between eye movements and facial emotions. Our objective was to find out whether emotion could be also visible in the dynamical properties of the eye movements. Methods. We have performed our experiment in two sessions related to different video presentations: 1) a reference session with all emotions presentation, and 2) the main session showing presentation of some specific emotions. During both sessions, we have video recordings of the subjects’ face expressions (FE) and eye movements (EM). We have calculated parameters of FE and EM dynamical changes and content of the noise. On this basis, by using time changes of EM, we have predicted 6 different face emotions. Results. We have recorded face expressions of 49 subjects who had the strongest responses to Happiness and Contempt facial emotions. We found statistically significant differences in parameters’ values describing FE and EM between the reference and the main sessions trials. Parameters connected to the Chaos showed highly positive correlations with Happiness, while both the Linear and the Noise components were mostly negatively correlated with this emotion. We achieved highest results with help of the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm obtaining: Accuracy of 0.89 (+/- 0.01) with the ROC-AUC score of 0.88 (F1 = 0.89), Precision = 0.85, Sensitivity / Recall = 0.93, Specificity = 0.82. Conclusions. We have observed that when the intensity of the Happiness increases, the eye movements become more chaotic and behave less noisy. We see possibilities for use of presented methods as a support for predictions in face expressions, when the lower part of the face is partially hidden, e.g. by a protective mask worn during the COVID epidemic. This could also be a method of confirming the authenticity of the Happiness mimicry, because it would be difficult to voluntarily correlate eye movements with certain levels of the Chaos.","2021","2022-07-15 09:03:12","2022-07-15 09:03:12","","2881-2892","","","192","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","chaos; empathy; eye moves; face emotions; happiness; machine-learning; noise; nonlinear dynamical systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

AR/MR-based remote collaboration on physical tasks has recently become more prominent in academic research and engineering applications. It has great potential in many fields, such as real-time remote medical consultation, education, training, maintenance, remote assistance in engineering, and other remote collaborative tasks. However, to the best of our knowledge there has not been any comprehensive review of research in AR/MR remote collaboration on physical tasks. Therefore, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of research between 2000 and 2018 in this domain. We collected 215 papers, more than 80% of which were published between 2010 and 2018, and all relevant works are discussed at length. Then we elaborate on the review from typical architectures, applications (e.g., industry, telemedicine, architecture, teleducation and others), and empathic computing. Next, we made an in-depth review of the papers from seven aspects: (1) collection and classification research, (2) using 3D scene reconstruction environments and live panorama, (3) periodicals and conducting research, (4) local and remote user interfaces, (5) features of user interfaces commonly used, (6) architecture and sharing non-verbal cues, (7) applications and toolkits. We find that most papers (160 articles, 74.4%) are published in conferences, using co-located collaboration to emulate remote collaboration is adopted by more than half (126, 58.6%) of the reviewed papers, the shared non-verbal cues can be mainly classified into five types (Virtual Replicas or Physical Proxy(VRP), AR Annotations or a Cursor Pointer(ARACP), avatar, gesture, and gaze), the local/remote interface is mainly divided into four categories (Head-Mounted Displays(HMD), Spatial Augmented Reality(SAR), Windows-Icon-Menu-Pointer(WIMP) and Hand-Held Displays(HHD)). From this, we can draw ten conclusions. Following this we report on issues for future works.

To explore these issues, we draw on the concept of technological ‘affordances’ and identify the range of possibilities for care that emerging chatbot interventions may afford and foreclose depending on the contexts in which they are implemented. Our analysis is based on qualitative data from interviews with clients (n=20) and focus group discussions with counsellors (n=8) conducted as part of a larger study of an Australian online alcohol and other drug counselling service. Both clients and counsellors expressed a concern that chatbot interventions lacked a ‘human’ element, which they valued in empathic care encounters. Most clients reported that they would share less information with a chatbot than a human counsellor, and they viewed this as constraining care. However, clients and counsellors suggested that the use of narrow AI might afford possibilities for performing discrete tasks, such as screening, triage or referral. In the context of what we refer to as ‘more-than-human’ care, our findings reveal complex views about the types of affordances that chatbots may produce and foreclose in online care encounters. We conclude by discussing implications for the potential ‘addiction futures’ and care trajectories that AI technologies offer, focussing on how they might inform alcohol and other drug policy, and the design of digital healthcare.","2021","2022-07-15 09:03:13","2022-07-15 09:03:13","","102910","","","94","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Addiction; Affordances; Artificial intelligence; Australia; Chatbots; Online care","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the specific elements of patientclinician communication that may support brain-to-brain concordance and therapeutic alliance are unknown. Here, we investigated how pain-related, directional facial communication between patients and clinicians is associated with brain-to-brain concordance. Patientclinician dyads interacted in a pain-treatment context, during synchronous assessment of brain activity (fMRI hyperscanning) and online video transfer, enabling face-to-face social interaction. In-scanner videos were used for automated individual facial action unit (AU) time-series extraction. First, an interpretable machine-learning classifier of patients facial expressions, from an independent fMRI experiment, significantly distinguished moderately painful leg pressure from innocuous pressure stimuli. Next, we estimated neural-network causality of patient-to-clinician directional information flow of facial expressions during clinician-initiated treatment of patients evoked pain. We identified a leaderfollower relationship in which patients predominantly led the facial communication while clinicians responded to patients expressions. Finally, analyses of dynamic brain-to-brain concordance showed that patients mid/posterior insular concordance with the clinicians anterior insula cortex, a region identified in previously published data from this study1, was associated with therapeutic alliance, and self-reported and objective (patient-to-clinician-directed causal influence) markers of negative-affect expressivity.

The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the first pandemic experienced by a world connected through the internet. We analyzed 105+ million tweets collected between March 1 and May 15, 2020, and Weibo messages compiled between January 20 and May 15, 2020, covering six languages (English, Spanish, Arabic, French, Italian, and Chinese) and represented an estimated 2.4 billion citizens worldwide. To examine fine-grained emotions during a pandemic, we built machine learning classification models based on deep learning language models to identify emotions in social media conversations about COVID-19, including positive expressions (optimistic, thankful, and empathetic), negative expressions (pessimistic, anxious, sad, annoyed, and denial), and a complicated expression, joking, which has not been explored before. Our analysis indicates a rapid increase and a slow decline in the volume of social media conversations regarding the pandemic in all six languages. The upsurge was triggered by a combination of economic collapse and confinement measures across the regions to which all the six languages belonged except for Chinese, where only the latter drove conversations. Tweets in all analyzed languages conveyed remarkably similar emotional states as the epidemic was elevated to pandemic status, including feelings dominated by a mixture of joking with anxious/pessimistic/annoyed as the volume of conversation surged and shifted to a general increase in positive states (optimistic, thankful, and empathetic), the strongest being expressed in Arabic tweets, as the pandemic came under control.","2021","2022-07-15 09:48:06","2022-07-15 09:48:06","","","","1","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","/z-wcorg/","","http://worldcat.org","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design characteristics that influence the look and feel of the virtual assistant, such as visual appearance or language features, may significantly influence users' experience and engagement with the assistant. This scoping review aims to provide an overview of the experimental research examining how design characteristics of virtual health assistants affect user experience, summarize research findings of experimental research examining how design characteristics of virtual health assistants affect user experience, and provide recommendations for the design of virtual health assistants if sufficient evidence exists. We searched 5 electronic databases (Web of Science, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and ACM Digital Library) to identify the studies that used an experimental design to compare the effects of design characteristics between 2 or more versions of an interactive virtual health assistant on user experience among adults. Data were synthesized descriptively. Health domains, design characteristics, and outcomes were categorized, and descriptive statistics were used to summarize the body of research. Results for each study were categorized as positive, negative, or no effect, and a matrix of the design characteristics and outcome categories was constructed to summarize the findings. The database searches identified 6879 articles after the removal of duplicates. We included 48 articles representing 45 unique studies in the review. The most common health domains were mental health and physical activity. Studies most commonly examined design characteristics in the categories of visual design or conversational style and relational behavior and assessed outcomes in the categories of personality, satisfaction, relationship, or use intention. Over half of the design characteristics were examined by only 1 study. Results suggest that empathy and relational behavior and self-disclosure are related to more positive user experience. Results also suggest that if a human-like avatar is used, realistic rendering and medical attire may potentially be related to more positive user experience; however, more research is needed to confirm this. There is a growing body of scientific evidence examining the impact of virtual health assistants' design characteristics on user experience. Taken together, data suggest that the look and feel of a virtual health assistant does affect user experience. Virtual health assistants that show empathy, display nonverbal relational behaviors, and disclose personal information about themselves achieve better user experience. At present, the evidence base is broad, and the studies are typically small in scale and highly heterogeneous. Further research, particularly using longitudinal research designs with repeated user interactions, is needed to inform the optimal design of virtual health assistants.","2021","2022-07-15 09:48:06","2022-07-15 09:48:06","","e31737","","12","23","","","","","","","","","","English","","","/z-wcorg/","","http://worldcat.org","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Much of the subtle historical symbolism appears to have went unnoticed by many reviewers who maligned the videogame and its creator David Cage for relying on lazy tropes that clunkily connect the African American civil rights movement to the narrative of woke androids engaging in a struggle for greater equality in society. Following scholarship that has examined the development of racialized thought in the past, this essay recognizes race as a powerful, yet malleable social construct, that sometimes changes over time. Racial concepts in the game do not perfectly align with historical or contemporary understandings of race in the United States. Androids, in short, all belong to the same race. This article then contends that the storylines of all three playable characters in the game resonate with well-crafted historical parallels and that the narrative geography in the gameworld often closely tethers to the historical geography of Detroit. The characters Markus, Connor, and Kara have intertwining stories that represent different elements of minority life in the United States with the clearest parallels to the historical experience of African Americans. Detroit: Become Human, nonetheless, is a science fiction game about androids. Framing the struggle for equal rights in the future with a group of beings that do not yet exist has the potential to disarm gameplayers of latent biases that may otherwise color their view of contemporary racial issues. The article asserts that the wedding together of past and future through experiential gameplay nurtures an empathic understanding of minority concerns that may carry over to the present to impact understandings of contemporary racial issues.","2021","2022-07-15 09:48:06","2022-07-15 09:48:06","","1-25","","24","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","/z-wcorg/","","http://worldcat.org","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We are familiar with the demonization of Brussels bureaucrats as a tool for pursuing the British exit from the European Union, and we take stories about the compulsory straightening of bananas with a pinch of salt, however frustrating it might be that some disaffected voters choose to accept these canards as true. But somehow, stories about the demonic in Africa have been accorded much greater ontological respect, not only by colonial powers keen to boost their own legitimacy through claims to a civilizing mission, but also by anthropologists anxious to understand their informants' imaginative concerns, perhaps without fully appreciating the political craft or guile with which these discourses are invested. In seeking to void the charge of delusion, an empathetic reading of demonization risks missing the strategic significance of mythic interventions intended to extract political advantage. This article examines an instance of mythic creativity in the politics of late nineteenth-century interior Sierra Leone as an example of the stagecraft sometimes implicit in African public authority. The case is that of the human leopard, an avatar of commercially compromised chieftaincy. The article asks whether the alleged activities of these leopards were the straight bananas of a certain form of anti-colonial political resistance. In a concluding discussion, some consequences for understanding current forms and practices of local public authority are inferred. </p>","2021","2022-07-15 09:48:06","2022-07-15 09:48:06","","226-248","","2","91","","","","","","","","","","English","","","/z-wcorg/","","http://worldcat.org","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many of the obstacles discussed in the literature are technical in character, regarding how to improve and optimize current practices in clinical medicine and also how to develop better data bases for optimal parameter adjustments and predictive algorithms. This paper argues that there are also in principle obstacles to the application of AI in clinical medicine and care where empathy is important, and that these problems cannot be solved with any of the technical and theoretical approaches that shape the current application of AI in specific areas of clinical medicine in which care for patients is fundamental. This is important, because it generates specific risks that may be overlooked otherwise, and it justifies the necessity of human monitoring and emotional intervention in clinical medicine. Consequently, difficult issues concerning moral and legal responsibility may ensue if these in principle problems are ignored.","2021","2022-07-15 09:48:06","2022-07-15 09:48:06","","1-7","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","/z-wcorg/","","http://worldcat.org","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A study on the effectiveness of motivational interviewing on engagement and therapeutic alliance","BMC Public Health BMC Public Health","","","","","Background: Cigarette smoking poses a major threat to public health. While cessation support provided by healthcare professionals is effective, its use remains low. Chatbots have the potential to serve as a useful addition. The objective of this study is to explore the possibility of using a motivational interviewing style chatbot to enhance engagement, therapeutic alliance, and perceived empathy in the context of smoking cessation. Methods: A preregistered web-based experiment was conducted in which smokers (n=153)ï¿½ï¿½were randomly assigned to either the motivational interviewing (MI)-style chatbot condition (n=78) or the neutral chatbot condition (n=75) and interacted with the chatbot in two sessions. In the assessment session, typical intake questions in smoking cessation interventions were administered by the chatbot, such as smoking history, nicotine dependence level, and intention to quit. In the feedback session, the chatbot provided personalized normative feedback and discussed with participants potential reasons to quit. Engagement with the chatbot, therapeutic alliance, and perceived empathy were the primary outcomes and were assessed after both sessions. Secondary outcomes were motivation to quit and perceived communication competence and were assessed after the two sessions. Results: No significant effects of the experimental manipulation (MI-style or neutral chatbot) were found on engagement, therapeutic alliance, or perceived empathy. A significant increase in therapeutic alliance over two sessions emerged in both conditions, with participants reporting significantly increased motivation to quit. The chatbot was perceived as highly competent, and communication competence was positively associated with engagement, therapeutic alliance, and perceived empathy. Conclusion: The results of this preregistered study suggest that talking with a chatbot about smoking cessation can help to motivate smokers to quit and that the effect of conversation has the potential to build up over time. We did not find support for an extra motivating effect of the MI-style chatbot, for which we discuss possible reasons. These findings highlight the promise of using chatbots to motivate smoking cessation. Implications for future research are discussed.","2022","2022-07-15 09:48:06","2022-07-15 09:48:06","","","","1","22","","","","","","","","","","English","","","/z-wcorg/","","http://worldcat.org","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In Mexico, the National Survey of Demographic Dynamics 2018, known by its Spanish acronym ENADID, collected information about breastfeeding practices. The ENADID survey is probabilistic and allows results to be generalized to the entire population in Mexico. Methods: Information from a public database featuring 26,587 mother-baby pairs was analyzed by proportions, means and associations, as well as machine learning methods, to conduct a comparison among the pairs according to immediate skin-to-skin contact after delivery status. Results: Skin-to-skin contact was described by 78.7% of the mothers and was associated with receiving an explanation regarding how to give breastmilk or the breast to the baby immediately following birth [Odds ratio (OR) 6.46; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 6.02, 6.97], initiating breastfeeding in the first hour of life (OR 2.01; 95% CI (1.84, 2.18) and a breastfeeding duration of6ï¿½ï¿½months (OR 1.16; 95% CI 1.08, 1.25). The breastfeeding duration, in days, was greater in the group with skin-to-skin contact than in the group without skin contact. Conclusions: In Mexico, immediate and uninterrupted skin-to-skin contact between newborns and their mothers should be facilitated. Support should be provided to mothers to favor skin-to-skin contact and breasting initiation during the first hour of life, ideally through an empathic explanation by trained health personnel.

There is hope that AI chatbots will meet a rising demand on healthcare systems to provide care to meet the shadow pandemic in mental health. Chatbots are viewed as improving efficiency, affordability, convenience, and patient-driven access with an implicit assumption that this will improve health equity and social inclusion. There are, however, three critically therapeutic aspects of in-person outpatient mental healthcare that are overlooked in discussions about chatbot alternatives: 1) the way mental illness compromises an individual's motivational and self-advocacy capacities, especially for those who are socially marginalized; 2) the embodied nature of empathic communication during any clinical encounter that involves attending to complex non-verbal cues; and 3) how social connections provided by in-person clinics provide indirect social benefits that are not part of a clinical checklist. These three challenges entail corresponding ethical risks of not meeting the obligation to respect patients as persons, to provide empathic care as part of beneficence, and to provide care inclusively to meet demands for fairness and justice.

Despite the importance of self-care, most patients with HF are not adequately taught the wide range of skills required to become proficient in self-care. Digital health technology (DHT) may provide a novel solution to support patients at home in effective self-care, with the view to enhancing the quality of life and ultimately improving patient outcomes. However, many of the solutions developed to date have failed to consider users' perspectives at the point of design, resulting in poor effectiveness. Leveraging a human-centered design (HCD) approach to the development of DHTs may lead to the successful promotion of self-care behaviors in patients with HF. This study aimed to outline the HCD, development, and evaluation process of a DHT designed to promote effective self-care in patients with HF. A design thinking approach within the HCD framework was undertaken, as described in the International Organization for Standardization 9241-210:2019 regulations, using a 5-step process: empathize, ideate, design, develop, and test. Patients with HF were involved throughout the design and evaluation of the system. The designed system was grounded in behavior change theory using the Theoretical Domains Framework and included behavior change techniques. Mixed methods were used to evaluate the DHT during the testing phase. Steps 1 to 3 of the process resulted in a set of evidence- and user-informed design requirements that were carried forward into the iterative development of a version 1 system. A cross-platform (iOS and Android) mobile app integrated with Fitbit activity trackers and smart scales was developed. A 2-week user testing phase highlighted the ease of use of the system, with patients demonstrating excellent adherence. Qualitative analysis of semistructured interviews identified the early potential for the system to positively influence self-care. Specifically, users perceived that the system increased their confidence and motivation to engage in key self-care behaviors, provided them with skills and knowledge that made them more aware of the importance of self-care behaviors, and might facilitate timely help seeking. The use of an HCD methodology in this research has resulted in the development of a DHT that may engage patients with HF and potentially affect their self-care behaviors. This comprehensive work lays the groundwork for further development and evaluation of this solution before its implementation in health care systems. A detailed description of the HCD process used in this research will help guide the development and evaluation of future DHTs across a range of disease use cases.","2022","2022-07-15 09:48:06","2022-07-15 09:48:06","","e34257","","5","6","","","","","","","","","","English","","","/z-wcorg/","","http://worldcat.org","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such systems need to create an empathic interaction with the users; therefore, it os required to include an Emotion Recognition (ER) framework which has to run, in near real-time, together with several other intelligent services. Most of the low-cost commercial robots, however, although more accessible by users and healthcare facilities, have to balance costs and effectiveness, resulting in under-performing hardware in terms of memory and processing unit. This aspect makes the design of the systems challenging, requiring a trade-off between the accuracy and the complexity of the adopted models. This paper proposes a compact and robust service for Assistive Robotics, called Lightweight EMotion recognitiON (LEMON), which uses image processing, Computer Vision and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms to recognize facial expressions. Specifically, the proposed DL model is based on Residual Convolutional Neural Networks with the combination of Dilated and Standard Convolution Layers. The first remarkable result is the few numbers (i.e., 1.6 Million) of parameters characterizing our model. In addition, Dilated Convolutions expand receptive fields exponentially with preserving resolution, less computation and memory cost to recognize the distinction among facial expressions by capturing the displacement of the pixels. Finally, to reduce the dying ReLU problem and improve the stability of the model, we apply an Exponential Linear Unit (ELU) activation function in the initial layers of the model. We have performed training and evaluation (via one- and five-fold cross validation) of the model with five datasets available in the community and one mixed dataset created by taking samples from all of them. With respect to the other approaches, our model achieves comparable results with a significant reduction in terms of the number of parameters.","2022","2022-07-15 09:48:06","2022-07-15 09:48:06","","","","9","22","","","","","","","","","","English","","","/z-wcorg/","","http://worldcat.org","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Digital health technologies are at the forefront of this transition in facilitating a role for the patient in the clinical dimensions of the healthcare trajectory, from diagnosis and interventions to treatment and recovery. Despite this prevalence in the clinical space, the non-clinical needs of patient mental health and wellbeing are frequently overlooked by contemporary patient-centered healthcare models. Conversational agents (or chatbots) are digital dialogue systems that are widespread and widely used in sequential information provision and information acquisition tasks. Given the intimate nature of this human-machine interaction, conversational agents can be effectively utilized to support and sustain patient mental health and wellbeing. In this paper, we propose an empathic conversational agent framework based on an ensemble of natural language processing techniques and artificial intelligence algorithms for real-time monitoring and co-facilitation of patient-centered healthcare for improved mental health and wellbeing outcomes. The technical contributions of this framework are; detection of patient emotions, prediction of patient emotion transitions, detection of group emotions, formulation of patient behavioral metrics, and resource recommendations based on patient concerns. The architectural contributions of the framework are intelligent communication channels that stream empathic conversational elements and resource recommendations for the multi-user conversations and co-facilitation updates for the human healthcare provider interface. The framework was empirically evaluated on a benchmark dataset and further validated based on a clinical protocol designed for its application in an online support group setting for cancer patients and caregivers in Canada. The results of these experiments confirm the effectiveness of this framework, its contributory role and practical value in realizing a patient-centered healthcare model for improved mental health and wellbeing outcomes.","2022","2022-07-15 09:48:06","2022-07-15 09:48:06","","318-329","","","126","","","","","","","","","","English","","","/z-wcorg/","","http://worldcat.org","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Not only might a highly automated state readily meet long-standing administrative law principles, but the responsible use of machine learning algorithms might perform even better than the status quo in terms of fulfilling administrative law's core values of expert decision-making and democratic accountability. Algorithmic governance clearly promises more accurate, data-driven decisions. Moreover, due to their mathematical properties, algorithms might well prove to be more faithful agents of democratic institutions. Yet even if an automated state were smarter and more accountable, it might risk being less empathic. Although the degree of empathy in existing human-driven bureaucracies should not be overstated, a large-scale shift to government by algorithm will pose a new challenge for administrative law: ensuring that an automated state is also an empathic one.","2021","2022-07-15 09:48:06","2022-07-15 09:48:06","","104-120","","3","150","","","","","","","","","","English","","","/z-wcorg/","","http://worldcat.org","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

AR/MR-based remote collaboration on physical tasks has recently become more prominent in academic research and engineering applications. It has great potential in many fields, such as real-time remote medical consultation, education, training, maintenance, remote assistance in engineering, and other remote collaborative tasks. However, to the best of our knowledge there has not been any comprehensive review of research in AR/MR remote collaboration on physical tasks. Therefore, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of research between 2000 and 2018 in this domain. We collected 215 papers, more than 80% of which were published between 2010 and 2018, and all relevant works are discussed at length. Then we elaborate on the review from typical architectures, applications (e.g., industry, telemedicine, architecture, teleducation and others), and empathic computing. Next, we made an in-depth review of the papers from seven aspects: (1) collection and classification research, (2) using 3D scene reconstruction environments and live panorama, (3) periodicals and conducting research, (4) local and remote user interfaces, (5) features of user interfaces commonly used, (6) architecture and sharing non-verbal cues, (7) applications and toolkits. We find that most papers (160 articles, 74.4%) are published in conferences, using co-located collaboration to emulate remote collaboration is adopted by more than half (126, 58.6%) of the reviewed papers, the shared non-verbal cues can be mainly classified into five types (Virtual Replicas or Physical Proxy(VRP), AR Annotations or a Cursor Pointer(ARACP), avatar, gesture, and gaze), the local/remote interface is mainly divided into four categories (Head-Mounted Displays(HMD), Spatial Augmented Reality(SAR), Windows-Icon-Menu-Pointer(WIMP) and Hand-Held Displays(HHD)). From this, we can draw ten conclusions. Following this we report on issues for future works. The paper also provides an overall academic roadmap and useful insight into the state-of-the-art of AR/MR remote collaboration on physical tasks.

Automated, objective pain detection from physiological data in patients provides valuable information to hospital staff and caregivers to better manage pain, particularly for patients who are unable to self-report. Galvanic skin response (GSR) is one of the physiologic signals that refers to the changes in sweat gland activity, which can identify features of emotional states and anxiety induced by varying pain levels. This study used different statistical features extracted from GSR data collected from postoperative patients to detect their pain intensity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work building pain models using postoperative adult patients instead of healthy subjects. The goal of this study was to present an automatic pain assessment tool using GSR signals to predict different pain intensities in noncommunicative, postoperative patients. The study was designed to collect biomedical data from postoperative patients reporting moderate to high pain levels. We recruited 25 participants aged 23-89 years. First, a transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) unit was employed to obtain patients' baseline data. In the second part, the Empatica E4 wristband was worn by patients while they were performing low-intensity activities. Patient self-report based on the numeric rating scale (NRS) was used to record pain intensities that were correlated with objectively measured data. The labels were down-sampled from 11 pain levels to 5 different pain intensities, including the baseline. We used 2 different machine learning algorithms to construct the models. The mean decrease impurity method was used to find the top important features for pain prediction and improve the accuracy. We compared our results with a previously published research study to estimate the true performance of our models. Four different binary classification models were constructed using each machine learning algorithm to classify the baseline and other pain intensities (Baseline [BL] vs Pain Level [PL] 1, BL vs PL2, BL vs PL3, and BL vs PL4). Our models achieved higher accuracy for the first 3 pain models than the BioVid paper approach despite the challenges in analyzing real patient data. For BL vs PL1, BL vs PL2, and BL vs PL4, the highest prediction accuracies were achieved when using a random forest classifier (86.0, 70.0, and 61.5, respectively). For BL vs PL3, we achieved an accuracy of 72.1 using a k-nearest-neighbor classifier. We are the first to propose and validate a pain assessment tool to predict different pain levels in real postoperative adult patients using GSR signals.

However, the unstructured nature of POR data derived from social media creates a number of challenges. The objectives of this research were to identify service quality (SERVQUAL) dimensions automatically from hospital Facebook reviews using a machine learning classifier, and to examine their associations with patient dissatisfaction. From January 2017 to December 2019, empirical research was conducted in which POR were gathered from the official Facebook page of Malaysian public hospitals. To find SERVQUAL dimensions in POR, a machine learning topic classification utilising supervised learning was developed, and this study's objective was established using logistic regression analysis. It was discovered that 73.5% of patients were satisfied with the public hospital service, whereas 26.5% were dissatisfied. SERVQUAL dimensions identified were 13.2% reviews of tangible, 68.9% of reliability, 6.8% of responsiveness, 19.5% of assurance, and 64.3% of empathy. After controlling for hospital variables, all SERVQUAL dimensions except tangible and assurance were shown to be significantly related with patient dissatisfaction (reliability, p < 0.001; responsiveness, p = 0.016; and empathy, p < 0.001). Rural hospitals had a higher probability of patient dissatisfaction (p < 0.001). Therefore, POR, assisted by machine learning technologies, provided a pragmatic and feasible way for capturing patient perceptions of care quality and supplementing conventional patient satisfaction surveys. The findings offer critical information that will assist healthcare authorities in capitalising on POR by monitoring and evaluating the quality of services in real time.","2021","2022-07-15 09:48:06","2022-07-15 09:48:06","","","","10","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","/z-wcorg/","","http://worldcat.org","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The proposed method extracts a frequency from speech data of twenty-four actors and actresses. In other words, it extracts voice features of their different emotions, preserves linguistic features, and converts emotions only. After that, it generates a frequency in variational auto-encoding Wasserstein generative adversarial network (VAW-GAN) in order to make prosody and preserve linguistic information. That makes it possible to learn speech features in parallel. Finally, it corrects a frequency by employing Amplitude Scaling. With the use of the spectral conversion of logarithmic scale, it is converted into a frequency in consideration of human hearing features. Accordingly, the proposed technique provides the emotion conversion of speeches in order to express emotions in line with artificially generated voices or speeches.","2022","2022-07-15 09:48:06","2022-07-15 09:48:06","","713-725","","2","16","","","","","","","","","","English","","","/z-wcorg/","","http://worldcat.org","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Forecasting the future of healthcare and health policy certainly is imperfect but nevertheless a precious scientific approach that can lead to novel innovative approaches. In the last decade, the healthcare system faced several challenges, including the significant increase of care costs, demographic changes towards the older population, inability to prevent and overcome pandemics, increased chronic and non-communicable diseases, or resistance to adopting emerging technologies. The need to shift the focus from sickness to health becomes a critical mission. We developed a lecture titled ""Healthtech Innovation Design"" for graduate students from medicine, biomedical engineering, neuroscience and software engineering. The lecture's goal is to teach innovation methodologies, exponential technologies and methods to achieve healthcare democratization. A critical component is to promote initiatives with global teams focused on the future of health. The educational and initiative programs were impactful in growing interest toward innovation, focusing on disruption and healthcare democratization. Participants awareness towards the main issues and challenges was raised. Interdisciplinary participation was qualitatively processed to generate a holistic vision toward innovation. Through embracing digitalization to a patient-centric approach, affordable care services, and the expansion of precision medicine, the entire healthcare organization and management will likely undergo a worldwide change. Notably, digital technologies, the leverage of artificial intelligence and empathy would satisfy unmet clinical needs. With a future-oriented statement, the forecast of healthcare becomes more imaginable, in which democratization will allow the affordability of services in different countries and economic status.","2021","2022-07-15 09:48:06","2022-07-15 09:48:06","","155-158","","2","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","/z-wcorg/","","http://worldcat.org","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Biological and Socio-Cognitive Factors Shaping Peoples Empathy with Social Robots","Int J of Soc Robotics International Journal of Social Robotics","","1875-4791","","","Abstract: This paper discuss the phenomenon of empathy in social robotics and is divided into three main parts. Initially, I analyse whether it is correct to use this concept to study and describe peoples reactions to robots. I present arguments in favour of the position that people actually do empathise with robots. I also consider what circumstances shape human empathy with these entities. I propose that two basic classes of such factors be distinguished: biological and socio-cognitive. In my opinion, one of the most important among them is a sense of group membership with robots, as it modulates the empathic responses to representatives of our- and other- groups. The sense of group membership with robots may be co-shaped by socio-cognitive factors such as ones experience, familiarity with the robot and its history, motivation, accepted ontology, stereotypes or language. Finally, I argue in favour of the formulation of a pragmatic and normative framework for manipulations in the level of empathy in humanrobot interactions.","2021","2022-07-15 09:48:06","2022-07-15 09:48:06","","341-355","","2","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","/z-wcorg/","","http://worldcat.org","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Mobile sensing researchers often program data processing and analysis code from scratch even though many research teams collect data from similar mobile sensors, platforms, and devices. This leads to significant inefficiency in not being able to replicate and build on others' work, inconsistency in quality of code and results, and lack of transparency when code is not shared alongside publications. We provide an overview of Reproducible Analysis Pipeline for Data Streams (RAPIDS), a reproducible pipeline to standardize the preprocessing, feature extraction, analysis, visualization, and reporting of data streams coming from mobile sensors. RAPIDS is formed by a group of R and Python scripts that are executed on top of reproducible virtual environments, orchestrated by a workflow management system, and organized following a consistent file structure for data science projects. We share open source, documented, extensible and tested code to preprocess, extract, and visualize behavioral features from data collected with any Android or iOS smartphone sensing app as well as Fitbit and Empatica wearable devices. RAPIDS allows researchers to process mobile sensor data in a rigorous and reproducible way. This saves time and effort during the data analysis phase of a project and facilitates sharing analysis workflows alongside publications.","2021","2022-07-15 09:48:06","2022-07-15 09:48:06","","769823","","","3","","","","","","","","","","English","","","/z-wcorg/","","http://worldcat.org","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Six male participants with professional driving experience were recruited and asked to complete daily trips in urban roadways of Chennai. The participants completed their trips in a sedan-type four-wheeler vehicle mounted with two cameras (near the rearview mirror) to record the traffic data and drivers in-vehicle behavior. An android phone mounted on the dashboard collected GPS and accelerometer data. The drivers wore an Empatica E4 device to record their physiological data, such as electrodermal activity, a key indicator of physiological stress. A holistic database assembled by linking different kinds of information was used to identify traffic events and road characteristics that can potentially impact the drivers physiological stress levels. This data was analyzed using a mixed-effects model. It was observed that U-turns and Protected Right turns in an intersection significantly increased the drivers stress. Additionally, slow-moving traffic in such scenarios further increased the effect. Merge Points serve as undesignated spaces for vehicle and pedestrian crossing and were identified as a contributor to the drivers stress. Alternatively, the presence of a median and a greater number of lanes significantly decreased the drivers stress. This paper reports a first-of-its-kind study conducted in India to assess the factors impacting drivers stress. Adopting measures and initiatives to modify the identified factors can help create a stress-free traffic environment for Indian drivers.","2022","2022-07-15 09:48:06","2022-07-15 09:48:06","","","","2","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","/z-wcorg/","","http://worldcat.org","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent research and experience have shone further light on factors influencing the implementation and usefulness of these approaches, as well as unresolved challenges and unintended consequences. These are considered in relation to not only digital technology and infrastructure, but also wider aspects of health systems, the nature of primary care work and culture, patient characteristics and inequalities, and ethical issues around data privacy, inclusion, empowerment, empathy and trust. Implications for the future direction and sustainability of these approaches are discussed, taking account of novel paradigms, such as artificial intelligence, and the growing capture of primary care data for secondary uses. Decision makers are encouraged to think holistically about where value is most likely to be added, or risks being taken away, when judging which innovations to carry forward. It concludes that, while responding to this public health emergency has created something of a digital 'big bang' for primary care, an incremental, adaptive, patient-centered strategy, focused on augmenting rather than replacing existing services, is likely to prove most fruitful in the longer term.","2021","2022-07-15 09:48:06","2022-07-15 09:48:06","","01005","","","11","","","","","","","","","","English","","","/z-wcorg/","","http://worldcat.org","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Currently, this is mainly done by clinicians in a clinical setting, which is dependent on subjective self-reported input from patients. Existing classification apps also rely on self-reported information and lack validation. Therefore, the exploratory mBrain study investigates moving to continuous, semi-autonomous and objective follow-up and classification based on both self-reported and objective physiological and contextual data. The data collection set-up of the observational, longitudinal mBrain study involved physiological data from the Empatica E4 wearable, data-driven machine learning (ML) algorithms detecting activity, stress and sleep events from the wearables' data modalities, and a custom-made application to interact with these events and keep a diary of contextual and headache-specific data. A knowledge-based classification system for individual headache attacks was designed, focusing on migraine, cluster headache (CH) and tension-type headache (TTH) attacks, by using the classification criteria of ICHD-3. To show how headache and physiological data can be linked, a basic knowledge-based system for headache trigger detection is presented. In two waves, 14 migraine and 4 CH patients participated (mean duration 22.3ï¿½ï¿½days). 133 headache attacks were registered (98 by migraine, 35 by CH patients). Strictly applying ICHD-3 criteria leads to 8/98 migraine without aura and 0/35 CH classifications. Adapted versions yield 28/98 migraine without aura and 17/35 CH classifications, with 12/18 participants having mostly diagnosis classifications when episodic TTH classifications (57/98 and 32/35) are ignored. Strictly applying the ICHD-3 criteria on individual attacks does not yield good classification results. Adapted versions yield better results, with the mostly classified phenotype (migraine without aura vs. CH) matching the diagnosis for 12/18 patients. The absolute number of migraine without aura and CH classifications is, however, rather low. Example cases can be identified where activity and stress events explain patient-reported headache triggers. Continuous improvement of the data collection protocol, ML algorithms, and headache classification criteria (including the investigation of integrating physiological data), will further improve future headache follow-up, classification and trigger detection.

However, as the opportunities offered by technology and artificial intelligence increase, digital assistants can also provide emotional support, which refers to empathetic, reassuring expressions for customers who have failed or succeeded in fulfilling a task. We show across four experiments that emotional support offered by a digital assistant increases customer satisfaction (Study 1 and 2) and persistence (Study 3 and 4) in using technology-mediated services. The increase in satisfaction occurs via the perceived warmth of the digital assistant, and the increase in persistence via the serial mediation of perceived warmth and satisfaction. Further, the results of a moderated serial mediation show that the effect on persistence only occurs when a digital (but not when a human) assistant provides emotional support in technology-mediated services. Finally, the effect of emotional support on persistence occurs independently of the digital assistant's embodiment. Practitioners learn how to imbue technology-mediated services with a human touch, inducing favorable customer outcomes.","2021","2022-07-15 09:48:06","2022-07-15 09:48:06","","176-193","","1","38","","","","","","","","","","English","","","/z-wcorg/","","http://worldcat.org","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We discuss an action-oriented account that emerges from a broader interpretation of the concept of sensorimotor contingencies. We suggest that dynamic informational and sensorimotor coupling across agents can mediate the deployment of action-effect contingencies in social contexts. We propose this concept of socializing sensorimotor contingencies (socSMCs) as a shared framework of analysis for processes within and across brains and bodies, and their physical and social environments. In doing so, we integrate insights from different fields, including neuroscience, psychology, and research on human-robot interaction. We review studies on dynamic embodied interaction and highlight empirical findings that suggest an important role of sensorimotor and informational entrainment in social contexts. Furthermore, we discuss links to closely related concepts, such as enactivism, models of coordination dynamics and others, and clarify differences to approaches that focus on mentalizing and high-level cognitive representations. Moreover, we consider conceptual implications of rethinking cognition as social sensorimotor coupling. The insight that social cognitive phenomena like joint attention, mutual trust or empathy rely heavily on the informational and sensorimotor coupling between agents may provide novel remedies for people with disturbed social cognition and for situations of disturbed social interaction. Furthermore, our proposal has potential applications in the field of human-robot interaction where socSMCs principles might lead to more natural and intuitive interfaces for human users.","2021","2022-07-15 09:48:06","2022-07-15 09:48:06","","624610","","","15","","","","","","","","","","English","","","/z-wcorg/","","http://worldcat.org","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although the replacement of human counsellors remains a speculative prospect, chatbots for narrow AI tasks (e.g., assessment and referral) are increasingly being used to augment clinical practice. Little research has addressed the possibilities for care that chatbots may generate in the future, particularly in the context of alcohol and other drug counselling. To explore these issues, we draw on the concept of technological affordances and identify the range of possibilities for care that emerging chatbot interventions may afford and foreclose depending on the contexts in which they are implemented. Our analysis is based on qualitative data from interviews with clients (n=20) and focus group discussions with counsellors (n=8) conducted as part of a larger study of an Australian online alcohol and other drug counselling service. Both clients and counsellors expressed a concern that chatbot interventions lacked a human element, which they valued in empathic care encounters. Most clients reported that they would share less information with a chatbot than a human counsellor, and they viewed this as constraining care. However, clients and counsellors suggested that the use of narrow AI might afford possibilities for performing discrete tasks, such as screening, triage or referral. In the context of what we refer to as more-than-human care, our findings reveal complex views about the types of affordances that chatbots may produce and foreclose in online care encounters. We conclude by discussing implications for the potential addiction futures and care trajectories that AI technologies offer, focussing on how they might inform alcohol and other drug policy, and the design of digital healthcare.","2021","2022-07-15 09:48:07","2022-07-15 09:48:07","","","","","94","","","","","","","","","","English","","","/z-wcorg/","","http://worldcat.org","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In our approach, a humanoid robot (Pepper, Softbanks Robotics) acts as a tutor for the child within autism care. The robot, equipped with multimodal sensor technology to acquire the emotional feedback of the child, stimulates the child to perform tasks, adapted to its current arousal state. By in-, or decreasing the difficulties of implemented training modules, the child can be given the appropriate task according to its emotional state. The childs arousal is measured with different techniques implemented in and on the robot: emotion detection based on audio recordings of the speech signal and camera detected facial expressions, or heart rate. To this end, the remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG) signal from camera recordings of the subjects face is acquired. While its unintrusive measurement is an advantage, a major drawback for rPPG is its proneness to motion and light artefacts requiring de-noising steps. A wavelet transform based on log-Gabor wavelets and a filter bank with 32 filters was implemented. The signal was filtered with a prior filter and afterwards with a Markov chain in order to extract the underlying pulse rate. Within an initial study, five children were observed watching videos with different co-notated emotions. As reference for the heart rate (HR), a wristband (empatica E4) was used. The captured emotions of all subjects were annotated to identify low and high arousal parts and positive and negative emotions. Extracted HR from rPPG-data indicated a correlation with the annotated emotions.","2021","2022-07-15 09:48:07","2022-07-15 09:48:07","","484-487","","2","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","/z-wcorg/","","http://worldcat.org","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the question remains whether this approach might reduce implicit gender bias, and the degree to which virtual immersion contributes to behavioral modulation following perspective taking tasks is unknown. Accordingly, we investigate the role of virtual perspective taking for binary gender using an online platform (Study 1) and immersive virtual reality (Study 2). Female and male undergraduates performed a simulated interview while virtually represented by an avatar that was either congruent or incongruent with their own gender. All participants rated a male and a female candidate on competence, hireability, likeability, empathy, and interpersonal closeness and then chose one of these two equivalently qualified candidates to hire for a laboratory assistant position in the male dominated industry of information technology. Online perspective taking did not reveal a significant influence of avatar gender on candidate ratings or candidate choice, whereas virtual reality perspective taking resulted in significant changes to participant behavior following exposure to a gender-incongruent avatar (e.g., male embodied as female), such that men showed preference for the female candidate and women showed preference for the male candidate. Although between-group differences in candidate ratings were subtle, rating trends were consistent with substantial differences in candidate choice, and this effect was greater for men. Compared to an online approach, virtual reality perspective taking appears to exert greater influence on acute behavioral modulation for gender bias due to its ability to fully immerse participants in the experience of (temporarily) becoming someone else, with empathy as a potential mechanism underlying this phenomenon.","2022","2022-07-15 09:48:07","2022-07-15 09:48:07","","e0269430","","6","17","","","","","","","","","","English","","","/z-wcorg/","","http://worldcat.org","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To contrast both accounts, a visual vignette experiment (Nï¿½ï¿½=ï¿½ï¿½253) depicted either malevolent or benevolent intentions towards robotic or human avatars. Additionally, we examined the role of harm-salience by showing patients as either harmed, or still unharmed. The results revealed significantly increased mind attribution towards visibly harmed patients, mediated by perceived pain and expressed empathy. Benevolent and malevolent intentions were evaluated respectively as morally right or wrong, but their impact on the patient was diminished for the robotic avatar. Contrary to dehumanisation predictions, our manipulation of intentions failed to affect mind perception. Nonetheless, benevolent intentions reduced dehumanisation of the patients. Moreover, when pain and empathy were statistically controlled, the effect of intentions on mind perception was mediated by dehumanisation. These findings suggest that perceived intentions might only be indirectly tied to mind perception, and that their role may be better understood when additionally accounting for empathy and dehumanisation.","2021","2022-07-15 09:48:07","2022-07-15 09:48:07","","454-465","","3","56","","","","","","","","","","English","","","/z-wcorg/","","http://worldcat.org","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We conducted a laboratory experiment in which participants interacted either with a diagnostic chatbot only or with an additional telemedicine professional before we interviewed them primarily on trust-building factors. We identified numerous software-related, user-related, and environment-related factors and derived a model of the initial trust-building process. The results support our assumption that it is equally essential to consider dimensions of physician and technology trust. One significant finding is that trust in a chatbot arises cognitively, while trusting a human agent is affect-based. We argue that the lack of affect-based trust inhibits the willingness to rely on diagnostic chatbots and facilitates the user's desire to keep control. Considering dimensions from doctor-patient trust, we found evidence that a chatbot's communication competencies are more important than empathic reactions as the latter may evoke incredibility feelings.

In this paper, we introduce a preliminary study on human-robot mental comforting conversation, to make an android robot (ERICA) present an understanding of the user's situation by sharing similar emotional experiences to enhance the perception of empathy. Specifically, we create the emotional speech for ERICA by using CycleGAN-based emotional voice conversion model, in which the pitch and spectrogram of the speech are converted according to the user's mental state. Then, we design dialogue scenarios for the user to talk about his/her predicament with ERICA. In the dialogue, ERICA shares other people's similar predicaments and adopts a low-spirit voice to express empathy to the interlocutor's situation. At the end of the dialogue, ERICA tries to encourage with a positive voice. Subsequently, questionnaire-based evaluation experiments were conducted with the recorded conversation. In the questionnaire, we use the Big Five scale to evaluate ERICA's personality. In addition, the perception of emotion, empathy, and encouragement in the dialogue are evaluated. The results show that the proposed emotional expression strategy helps the android robot better present low-spirit emotion, empathy, the personality of extroversion, while making the user better feel the encouragement.","2022","2022-07-15 09:48:07","2022-07-15 09:48:07","","","","3","22","","","","","","","","","","English","","","/z-wcorg/","","http://worldcat.org","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Users trust chatbots for rational reasons and physicians for emotional ones.  Transparency, sufficient interaction capabilities, and reliability are vital.  The interaction's perceived naturalness is more important than emotional responses.  Trusting health bots is subject to environmental changes and developments.<br>Technological advancements in the virtual assistants' domain pave the way to implement complex autonomous agents like diagnostic chatbots. Drawing on the assumption that chatbots are perceived as both technological tools and social actors, we aim to create a deep understanding of trust-building processes towards diagnostic chatbots compared to trust in medical professionals. We conducted a laboratory experiment in which participants interacted either with a diagnostic chatbot only or with an additional telemedicine professional before we interviewed them primarily on trust-building factors. We identified numerous software-related, user-related, and environment-related factors and derived a model of the initial trust-building process. The results support our assumption that it is equally essential to consider dimensions of physician and technology trust. One significant finding is that trust in a chatbot arises cognitively, while trusting a human agent is affect-based. We argue that the lack of affect-based trust inhibits the willingness to rely on diagnostic chatbots and facilitates the user's desire to keep control. Considering dimensions from doctor-patient trust, we found evidence that a chatbot's communication competencies are more important than empathic reactions as the latter may evoke incredibility feelings. To verify our findings, we applied the derived code system in a larger online survey.","2022","2022-07-15 09:48:07","2022-07-15 09:48:07","","","","","165","","","","","","","","","","English","","","/z-wcorg/","","http://worldcat.org","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the experimental condition, the robotic object performed emphatic gestures, modeled according to the behavior of a trained therapist. In the baseline condition, the robotic object performed up-and-down gestures, without directing attention towards the participants. Findings show that the robots empathy-related gestures significantly improved the emotional support quality provided by one participant to another, as indicated by both subjective and objective measures.

This is mostly because it can induce empathy through embodiment experiences in outgroup membership. However, the potential of intergroup contact with an outgroup avatar in VR to increase empathy is less studied. Even though intergroup contact literature suggests that less threatening and more prosocial emotions are the key to understanding why intergroup contact is a powerful mean to decrease prejudice, few studies have investigated the effect of intergroup contact on empathy in VR. In this study, we developed a between-participants design to investigate how VR can be used to create a positive intergroup contact with a member of a stigmatized outgroup (ethnic minority) and present the results of the effect of intergroup contact in VR on empathy. Sixty four participants experienced either positive contact (i.e., equal intergroup status, collaborative) with a black (experimenter-controlled) avatar (experimental condition) or no intergroup contact (i.e., ingroup contact with a white avatar; control condition), with situational empathy (personal distress and empathic interest) being measured through a self-report questionnaire up to a week before and right after the VR contact experience. The experiment showed that satisfying degrees of body ownership of participants' own avatar and co-presence with the contacted avatar can be achieved in simple and universally accessible virtual environments such as AltspaceVR. The results indicated that while VR intergroup contact had no significant direct effect on empathy, exploratory analyses indicated that post-intervention empathic interest increased with stronger feelings of co-presence in the intergroup contact condition.","2021","2022-07-15 09:48:07","2022-07-15 09:48:07","","815497","","","12","","","","","","","","","","English","","","/z-wcorg/","","http://worldcat.org","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A humanoid mechanical technology is another difficult field. To co-work with people, humanoid robots not just need to include human like structure and structure, yet more significantly, they should arrange human like conduct with respect to the movement, correspondence and intelligence. In environmental factors where human exchange can't be conceivable to do a specific errand, the robots can do. Robots are used for lean industrial processes and have diversified their contributions to meeting lines inside the production international. The main focus of this project is to design and develop the mechanism for robotic arm for lifting. It is a type of mechanical arm, usually programmable, with similar functions to a human arm. The arm might be a unit system or might be an aspect of a more unpredictable mechanical cycle. The end effectors or mechanical hand can be intended to play out any ideal undertaking, for example, welding, holding, turning etc., depending on the application. The mechanical arm is planned and designed with four degrees of freedom and modified to achieve precisely basic light material lifting undertaking to aid the creation line in any industry. 3D printing strategy is utilized in this undertaking to create the parts of the automated arm. Hence, it gave more exact measurements and gigantic time and cost expensive in creation. The automated arm is furnished with 4 servo engines to interface the parts and bring arm development. A sequential construction mechanical system can improve its efficiency through developing the assembling pace and its consistency. They additionally spare individuals from dreary and tedious mechanical production system employments. Many industries are yet to implement such automation in their meeting traces, as they do no longer have the technical recognize how of the changeover, or the concern of failure of investment. It is proposed to layout and increase a low price assembly robotic which could overcome the above drawbacks. We have also included Design Thinking process before starting to do this experiment. The stages of Design Thinking such as Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype & test, Evolve are performed in the complete fabrication of the robotic arm. Many industries are yet to implement such automation in their assembly lines, as they do not have the technical knowhow of the changeover, or the fear of failure of investment. To proceed in this direction, a case study was conducted at a phase selector switch making company. Presently the company does manual assembly of the switches, which is a hindrance to the growth of the company. This process required a pilot study to explore the possibility as well as the implementations issues of robots in the assembly. The present system uses a belt conveyor system which has no feedback signals and the speed of the conveyor is not synchronized with the rate of assembly. It is generally not advised to transfer small size components in a conveyor since picking, orienting and inserting the components will be cumbersome. When the size of the component is considerably small, manual assembly is not recommended as per the guidelines of DFMA (Design for manufacture and assembly). Manual error is more prone to assembly of the part in a wrong orientation, especially for those components that are symmetrical. The parts to be assembled are both axi-symmetric as well as prismatic in shape. Constraints in loading and unloading of casing were also reported. In this work, the design and development of a low cost assembly robot is done which can overcome the above drawbacks.","2021","2022-07-15 09:48:07","2022-07-15 09:48:07","","","","1","1059","","","","","","","","","","English","","","/z-wcorg/","","http://worldcat.org","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although the replacement of human counsellors remains a speculative prospect, chatbots for 'narrow AI' tasks (e.g., assessment and referral) are increasingly being used to augment clinical practice. Little research has addressed the possibilities for care that chatbots may generate in the future, particularly in the context of alcohol and other drug counselling. To explore these issues, we draw on the concept of technological 'affordances' and identify the range of possibilities for care that emerging chatbot interventions may afford and foreclose depending on the contexts in which they are implemented. Our analysis is based on qualitative data from interviews with clients (n=20) and focus group discussions with counsellors (n=8) conducted as part of a larger study of an Australian online alcohol and other drug counselling service. Both clients and counsellors expressed a concern that chatbot interventions lacked a 'human' element, which they valued in empathic care encounters. Most clients reported that they would share less information with a chatbot than a human counsellor, and they viewed this as constraining care. However, clients and counsellors suggested that the use of narrow AI might afford possibilities for performing discrete tasks, such as screening, triage or referral. In the context of what we refer to as 'more-than-human' care, our findings reveal complex views about the types of affordances that chatbots may produce and foreclose in online care encounters. We conclude by discussing implications for the potential 'addiction futures' and care trajectories that AI technologies offer, focussing on how they might inform alcohol and other drug policy, and the design of digital healthcare.","2021","2022-07-15 09:48:07","2022-07-15 09:48:07","","102910","","","94","","","","","","","","","","English","","","/z-wcorg/","","http://worldcat.org","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In early-to-mid 2021, young adults and minority populations disproportionately affected by COVID-19 in the United States were more likely to be hesitant toward COVID-19 vaccines, citing concerns regarding vaccine safety and effectiveness. Successful chatbot communication requires purposive understanding of user needs. We aimed to review the acceptability of messages to be delivered by a chatbot named VIRA from Johns Hopkins University. The study investigated which message styles were preferred by young, urban-dwelling Americans as well as public health workers, since we anticipated that the chatbot would be used by the latter as a job aid. We conducted 4 web-based focus groups with 20 racially and ethnically diverse young adults aged 18-28 years and public health workers aged 25-61 years living in or near eastern-US cities. We tested 6 message styles, asking participants to select a preferred response style for a chatbot answering common questions about COVID-19 vaccines. We transcribed, coded, and categorized emerging themes within the discussions of message content, style, and framing. Participants preferred messages that began with an empathetic reflection of a user concern and concluded with a straightforward, fact-supported response. Most participants disapproved of moralistic or reasoning-based appeals to get vaccinated, although public health workers felt that such strong statements appealing to communal responsibility were warranted. Responses tested with humor and testimonials did not appeal to the participants. To foster credibility, chatbots targeting young people with vaccine-related messaging should aim to build rapport with users by deploying empathic, reflective statements, followed by direct and comprehensive responses to user queries. Further studies are needed to inform the appropriate use of user-customized testimonials and humor in the context of chatbot communication.","2022","2022-07-15 09:48:07","2022-07-15 09:48:07","","e38418","","7","24","","","","","","","","","","English","","","/z-wcorg/","","http://worldcat.org","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To maintain a healthy interpersonal relationship through text messaging, our negative mental states, such as anger, have to be well-controlled. This paper discusses the use of a handheld social robot deployed as a mediator in text messaging between humans. The robot is equipped with a movable weight inside its body. By controlling the movement of the internal weight during the time when the robot speaks out messages received from a human sender, we hypothesize that the psychological state of a receiver who holds the robot can be affected (for example, he/she will listen to the messages more seriously). In a controlled study (n = 94), in which participants were manipulated to be frustrated by using a context scenario, we studied the effect of three dialogue scripts with/without weight shifts. Results showed that introducing weight shifts together with the robot speech suppressed on average 23% of the user's anger. However, only 3.5% of the anger was suppressed when the weight shifts were not applied. Additionally, in cases where the robot showed empathy to the user in words with weight shifts, the user's revenge urge was successfully reduced by 22%. There was almost no effect confirmed when the weight shifts were not applied. A similar effect was also found in avoidance motivation: 15% of the avoidance motivation was reduced if weight shifts were applied. The reductions in revenge and avoidance motivation are considered important factors for human forgiveness. Therefore, our findings provide experimental evidence that weight shifts can be an effective expression modality for mediator robots, from the perspective of not only suppressing the user's anger but also by inducing forgiveness during messaging.","2022","2022-07-15 09:48:07","2022-07-15 09:48:07","","790209","","","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","/z-wcorg/","","http://worldcat.org","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Wearable sensors may provide a novel way to detect social anxiety and result in new opportunities for monitoring and treatment, which would be greatly beneficial for persons with social anxiety, society, and health care services. Nevertheless, indicators such as skin temperature measured by wrist-worn sensors have not been used in prior work on physiological social anxiety detection. This study aimed to investigate whether subclinical social anxiety in young adults can be detected using physiological data obtained from wearable sensors, including heart rate, skin temperature, and electrodermal activity (EDA). Young adults (N=12) with self-reported subclinical social anxiety (measured using the widely used self-reported version of the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale) participated in an impromptu speech task. Physiological data were collected using an E4 Empatica wearable device. Using the preprocessed data and following a supervised machine learning approach, various classification algorithms such as Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) were used to develop models for 3 different contexts. Models were trained to differentiate (1) between baseline and socially anxious states, (2) among baseline, anticipation anxiety, and reactive anxiety states, and (3) social anxiety among individuals with social anxiety of differing severity. The predictive capability of the singular modalities was also explored in each of the 3 supervised learning experiments. The generalizability of the developed models was evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation as a performance index. With modalities combined, the developed models yielded accuracies between 97.54% and 99.48% when differentiating between baseline and socially anxious states. Models trained to differentiate among baseline, anticipation anxiety, and reactive anxiety states yielded accuracies between 95.18% and 98.10%. Furthermore, the models developed to differentiate between social anxiety experienced by individuals with anxiety of differing severity scores successfully classified with accuracies between 98.86% and 99.52%. Surprisingly, EDA was identified as the most effective singular modality when differentiating between baseline and social anxiety states, whereas ST was the most effective modality when differentiating anxiety among individuals with social anxiety of differing severity. The results indicate that it is possible to accurately detect social anxiety as well as distinguish between levels of severity in young adults by leveraging physiological data collected from wearable sensors.","2021","2022-07-15 09:48:07","2022-07-15 09:48:07","","e32656","","10","5","","","","","","","","","","English","","","/z-wcorg/","","http://worldcat.org","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent studies about pain empathy for robots found humans present similar empathy process towards humanoid robots under painful stimuli as well as to humans. However, the whole-brain functional connectivity and the spatial dynamics of neural activities underlying empathic processes are still unknown. In the present study, the functional connectivity was investigated for ERPs recorded from 18 healthy adults who were presented with pictures of human hand and robot hand under painful and non-painful situations. Functional brain networks for both early and late empathy responses were constructed and a new parameter, empathy index (EI), was proposed to represent the empathy ability of humans quantitatively. We found that the mutual dependences between early ERP components was significantly decreased, but for the late components, there were no significant changes. The mutual dependences for human hand stimuli were larger than to robot hand stimuli for early components, but not for late components. The connectivity weights for early components were larger than late components. EI value shows significant difference between painful and non-painful stimuli, indicating it is a good indicator to represent the empathy of humans. This study enriches our understanding of the neurological mechanisms implicated in human empathy, and provides evidence of functional connectivity for both early and late responses of pain empathy towards humans and robots.","2021","2022-07-15 09:48:07","2022-07-15 09:48:07","","107695","","","151","","","","","","","","","","English","","","/z-wcorg/","","http://worldcat.org","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper argues that there are also in principle obstacles to the application of AI in clinical medicine and care where empathy is important, and that these problems cannot be solved with any of the technical and theoretical approaches that shape the current application of AI in specific areas of clinical medicine in which care for patients is fundamental. This is important, because it generates specific risks that may be overlooked otherwise, and it justifies the necessity of human monitoring and emotional intervention in clinical medicine. Consequently, difficult issues concerning moral and legal responsibility may ensue if these in principle problems are ignored.","2021","2022-07-15 09:48:07","2022-07-15 09:48:07","","1-7","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","/z-wcorg/","","http://worldcat.org","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Two types of electronic instructors, a robot and a tablet computer, were located close to the disposal area to provide instructions on appropriate waste disposal. The comparison of the effectiveness of the two types of electronic instructors found that participants exposed to the robot sorted the waste more accurately than participants exposed to the tablet computer.

A Bayesian network embeds prior knowledge into an intrinsic environment, providing a measure of cost that is used to boostrap learning without an external reward signal.

Moreover, the translation from research to a valuable and affordable product/process innovation is not formalized by the current teachings that focus on short-term rather than long-term developments, leading to inaccurate and incremental forecasting on the future of healthcare and longevity. The Stanford Biodesign approach of unmet clinical need detection would be an excellent starting methodology for health-related innovation work, although unfortunately not widely taught yet. We have developed a novel lecture titled HealthTec Innovation Design (HTID) offered in an interdisciplinary setup to medical students and biomedical engineers. It teaches a future-oriented view and the application and effects of exponential trends. We implemented a novel approach using the Purpose Launchpad meta-methodology combined with other innovation generation tools to define, experiment, and validate existing project ideas. As part of the process of defining the novel curriculum, we used experimentation methods, like a global science fiction event to create a comic book with Future Health stories and an Innovation Think Tank Certification Program of a large medical technology company that is focused on identifying future health opportunities. We conducted before and after surveys and concluded that the proposed initiatives were impactful in developing an innovative design thinking approach. Participants' awareness and enthusiasm were raised, including their willingness to implement taught skills, values, and methods in their working projects.

Prosocial games are games focusing on helping others. Game researchers have been keen to investigate factors that influence the immersive experience in digital games. Previous studies show that VR allows people to take the perspective of others, inducing empathy and prosocial behaviour in the real world. In this lab-based study, we explore whether and how taking the perspective of other game characters - NPCs in a prosocial VR game - influences players in-game empathy towards NPCs and game immersion. Participants first experienced either a robots perspective of being destroyed by fire in VR or read a text description about the same event. Then, they participated a prosocial VR game in which they saved robots. The findings show that perspective-taking experiences indirectly enhance participants game immersion via the effects of closeness with the destroyed robot and empathy towards the four robots protected by the player. This indirect effect is moderated by players weekly exposure to video games. These results suggest that VR-based perspective-taking of NPCs can indirectly enhance gameplay experiences in prosocial VR games. Theoretical and game design implications are discussed.","2022","2022-07-15 09:48:07","2022-07-15 09:48:07","","1185-1198","","6","41","","","","","","","","","","English","","","/z-wcorg/","","http://worldcat.org","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Reasons include lack of funds for specialist services, scarcity of trained mental health professionals, and the stigma attached to mental illness. In recent years there have been many studies demonstrating effective delivery of psychological interventions through a variety of non-specialists. While these interventions are cost-effective and less stigmatising, efforts to scale-up are hampered by issues of quality-control, and what has been described by implementation scientists as 'voltage-drop' and 'programme-drift.'

The active ingredients of this cognitive-therapy based intervention are delivered by a virtual 'avatar' therapist incorporated into the App which is operated by a 'peer' (a woman from the neighbourhood with no prior experience of healthcare delivery). Using automated cues from the App, the peer reinforces key therapeutic messages, helps with problem-solving and provides the non-specific but essential therapeutic elements of empathy and support. The peer and App therefore act as co-therapists in delivery of the intervention. The peer can deliver the intervention with good fidelity after brief automated in-built training. This approach has the potential to be applied to other areas of mental health and help bridge the treatment gap, especially in resource-poor settings.

In the service literature, the service is usually delivered by a human to a human customer and the quality of the service is often evaluated using the SERVQUAL dimensions. An extensive review of the literature shows there is a lack of an empirical model to assess the perceived service quality provided by a social robot. Furthermore, the social robot literature highlights key differences between human service and social robots. For example, scholars have highlighted the importance of entertainment value and engagement in the adoption of social robots in the service industry. However, it is unclear whether the SERVQUAL dimensions are appropriate to measure social robot's service quality. The paper proposes the SERVBOT model to assess a social robot's service quality. It identifies, reliability, responsiveness, assurance, empathy, and entertainment as the five dimensions of SERVBOT. Further, the research will investigate how these five factors influence emotional engagement and future intentions to use the social robot in a concierge service setting. The model was tested using student sampling, and a total of 94 responses were collected for the study. The findings indicate empathy and entertainment value as key predictors of emotional engagement. Further, emotional engagement is a strong predictor of future intention to use a social robot in a service setting. This study is the first to propose the SERVBOT model to measure social robot's service quality. The model provides a theoretical underpinning on the key service quality dimensions of a social robot and gives scholars and managers a method to track the service quality of a social robot. The study also extends on the literature by exploring the key factors that influence the use of social robots (i.e., emotional engagement).","2021","2022-07-15 09:48:07","2022-07-15 09:48:07","","746674","","","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","/z-wcorg/","","http://worldcat.org","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Additionally, it is argued that extant HRI research often fails to recognize the complexity of empathy and sympathy, such that the two concepts are frequently treated as synonymous. The arguments for these claims occur in two steps. First, it is argued that there are at least three understandings of empathy, such that particular care is needed when researching ""empathy"" in human-robot interactions. The phenomenological approach to empathy-perhaps the least utilized of the three discussed understandings-is the approach with the most direct implications for moral standing. Furthermore, because ""empathy"" and ""sympathy"" are often conflated, a novel account of sympathy which makes clear the difference between the two concepts is presented, and the importance for these distinctions is argued for. In the second step, the phenomenological insights presented before regarding the nature of empathy are applied to the problem of robot moral standing to argue that empathetic and sympathetic engagement with an entity constitute an ethical engagement with it. The paper concludes by offering several potential research questions that result from the phenomenological analysis of empathy in human-robot interactions.","2021","2022-07-15 09:48:07","2022-07-15 09:48:07","","791527","","","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","/z-wcorg/","","http://worldcat.org","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this article, we propose a novel framework for human-computer/robot interaction and introduce a preliminary intervention study for improving the emotion recognition of Chinese children with an autism spectrum disorder. The core of the framework is the Facial Emotion Cognition and Training System (FECTS, including six tasks to train children with ASD to match, infer, and imitate the facial expressions of happiness, sadness, fear, and anger) based on Simon Baron-Cohen's E-S (empathizing-systemizing) theory. Our system may be implemented on PCs, smartphones, mobile devices such as PADs, and robots. The training record (e.g., a tracked record of emotion imitation) of the Chinese autistic children interacting with the device implemented using our FECTS will be uploaded and stored in the database of a cloud-based evaluation system. Therapists and parents can access the analysis of the emotion learning progress of these autistic children using the cloud-based evaluation system. Deep-learning algorithms of facial expressions recognition and attention analysis will be deployed in the back end (e.g., devices such as a PC, a robotic system, or a cloud system) implementing our FECTS, which can perform real-time tracking of the imitation quality and attention of the autistic children during the expression imitation phase. In this preliminary clinical study, a total of 10 Chinese autistic children aged 3-8 are recruited, and each of them received a single 20-minute training session every day for four consecutive days. Our preliminary results validated the feasibility of the developed FECTS and the effectiveness of our algorithms based on Chinese children with an autism spectrum disorder.

This article presents a review of the literature (20102020) in the fields of humanrobot interaction (HRI), psychology, neuropsychology, and roboethics, discussing the potential impact of communication with social robots on childrens social and emotional development. The critical analysis of evidence behind these discussions shows that, although robots theoretically have high chances of influencing the development of empathy in children, depending on their design, intensity, and context of use, there is no certainty about the kind of effect they might have. Most of the analyzed studies, which showed the ability of robots to improve empathy levels in children, were not longitudinal, while the studies observing and arguing for the negative effect of robots on childrens empathy were either purely theoretical or dependent on the specific design of the robot and the situation.

However, it is currently unknown how such experiences are modified by the sexual congruency between the human and the artificial agent. In two studies, heterosexual men (Experiment 1) and women (Experiment 2) embodied same-sex and opposite-sex avatars and were asked to evaluate the experience (e.g., pleasantness, erogeneity) of being touched on social or intimate areas of their virtual body by a male or female avatar. Electrocardiogram and galvanic skin response were also recorded. Moreover, participants' implicit and explicit gender biases were examined via a gender-potency implicit association test and the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory. When embodying a same-sex avatar, men and women rated caresses on intimate areas from an avatar of the opposite sex as more pleasant and erogenous. Conversely, body swap-that is, wearing an opposite-sex avatar-enhanced participants' perceptions of pleasantness and erogeneity for caresses on intimate areas from a same-sex toucher. This effect was stronger in men than in women. Furthermore, physiological correlates of enhanced processing of arousing stimuli predicted behavioural outcomes during the body swap illusion. Wearing an opposite-sex avatar affects one's own body representations and may have important implications on people's attitudes and implicit reactivity to touch-mediated interactions. Men seem more susceptible to this type of body swap illusion. Our paradigm may induce profound changes of cross-sex perspective-taking and provide novel tools for promoting empathy and comprehension of sex-related diversity.","2022","2022-07-15 09:48:07","2022-07-15 09:48:07","","461-474","","3","75","","","","","","","","","","English","","","/z-wcorg/","","http://worldcat.org","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Currently, this is mainly done by clinicians in a clinical setting, which is dependent on subjective self-reported input from patients. Existing classification apps also rely on self-reported information and lack validation. Therefore, the exploratory mBrain study investigates moving to continuous, semi-autonomous and objective follow-up and classification based on both self-reported and objective physiological and contextual data. Methods: The data collection set-up of the observational, longitudinal mBrain study involved physiological data from the Empatica E4 wearable, data-driven machine learning (ML) algorithms detecting activity, stress and sleep events from the wearables data modalities, and a custom-made application to interact with these events and keep a diary of contextual and headache-specific data. A knowledge-based classification system for individual headache attacks was designed, focusing on migraine, cluster headache (CH) and tension-type headache (TTH) attacks, by using the classification criteria of ICHD-3. To show how headache and physiological data can be linked, a basic knowledge-based system for headache trigger detection is presented. Results: In two waves, 14 migraine and 4 CH patients participated (mean duration 22.3ï¿½ï¿½days). 133 headache attacks were registered (98 by migraine, 35 by CH patients). Strictly applying ICHD-3 criteria leads to 8/98 migraine without aura and 0/35 CH classifications. Adapted versions yield 28/98 migraine without aura and 17/35 CH classifications, with 12/18 participants having mostly diagnosis classifications when episodic TTH classifications (57/98 and 32/35) are ignored. Conclusions: Strictly applying the ICHD-3 criteria on individual attacks does not yield good classification results. Adapted versions yield better results, with the mostly classified phenotype (migraine without aura vs. CH) matching the diagnosis for 12/18 patients. The absolute number of migraine without aura and CH classifications is, however, rather low. Example cases can be identified where activity and stress events explain patient-reported headache triggers. Continuous improvement of the data collection protocol, ML algorithms, and headache classification criteria (including the investigation of integrating physiological data), will further improve future headache follow-up, classification and trigger detection.","2022","2022-07-15 09:48:07","2022-07-15 09:48:07","","","","1","22","","","","","","","","","","English","","","/z-wcorg/","","http://worldcat.org","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The relationship between effective connectivity within these two important circuits and empathy ability - evaluated with the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) - was assessed by machine learning algorithm using multivariate regression analysis. In accordance with the neurocircuitry disruptions of cocaine addiction, the results showed that cocaine-dependent subjects relative to healthy controls had altered resting state effective connectivity between parts of the memory and reward systems. Furthermore, effective connectivity between the memory and reward system could predict the fantasy empathy (FE) subscale scores in cocaine dependence. Overall, our findings provide further evidence for the neural substrates of social cognition in cocaine-dependent patients. These new insights could be useful for the development of new treatment programs for this substance dependency disorder.","2021","2022-07-15 09:48:07","2022-07-15 09:48:07","","1553-1561","","3","15","","","","","","","","","","English","","","/z-wcorg/","","http://worldcat.org","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, progress is not always followed by ethical reflection on its consequences or scientists responsibility for their creations. The humanities can help health sciences students learn to critically analyse these issues; in particular, literature can aid discussions about ethical principles in biomedical research. Mary Shelleys Frankenstein; or, the modern Prometheus (1818) is an example of a classic novel presenting complex scenarios that could be used to stimulate discussion. Main text: Within the framework of the 200th anniversary of the novel, we searched PubMed to identify works that explore and discuss its value in teaching health sciences. Our search yielded 56 articles, but only two of these reported empirical findings. Our analysis of these articles identified three main approaches to using Frankenstein in teaching health sciences: discussing the relationship between literature and science, analysing ethical issues in biomedical research, and examining the importance of empathy and compassion in healthcare and research. After a critical discussion of the articles, we propose using Frankenstein as a teaching tool to prompt students to critically analyse ethical aspects of scientific and technological progress, the need for compassion and empathy in medical research, and scientists responsibility for their discoveries. Conclusion: Frankenstein can help students reflect on the personal and social limits of science, the connection between curiosity and scientific progress, and scientists responsibilities. Its potential usefulness in teaching derives from the interconnectedness of science, ethics, and compassion. Frankenstein can be a useful tool for analysing bioethical issues related to scientific and technological advances, such as artificial intelligence, genetic engineering, and cloning. Empirical studies measuring learning outcomes are necessary to confirm the usefulness of this approach.","2021","2022-07-15 09:48:07","2022-07-15 09:48:07","","","","1","22","","","","","","","","","","English","","","/z-wcorg/","","http://worldcat.org","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Currently, this is mainly done by clinicians in a clinical setting, which is dependent on subjective self-reported input from patients. Existing classification apps also rely on self-reported information and lack validation. Therefore, the exploratory mBrain study investigates moving to continuous, semi-autonomous and objective follow-up and classification based on both self-reported and objective physiological and contextual data. The data collection set-up of the observational, longitudinal mBrain study involved physiological data from the Empatica E4 wearable, data-driven machine learning (ML) algorithms detecting activity, stress and sleep events from the wearables data modalities, and a custom-made application to interact with these events and keep a diary of contextual and headache-specific data. A knowledge-based classification system for individual headache attacks was designed, focusing on migraine, cluster headache (CH) and tension-type headache (TTH) attacks, by using the classification criteria of ICHD-3. To show how headache and physiological data can be linked, a basic knowledge-based system for headache trigger detection is presented. In two waves, 14 migraine and 4 CH patients participated (mean duration 22.3ï¿½ï¿½days). 133 headache attacks were registered (98 by migraine, 35 by CH patients). Strictly applying ICHD-3 criteria leads to 8/98 migraine without aura and 0/35 CH classifications. Adapted versions yield 28/98 migraine without aura and 17/35 CH classifications, with 12/18 participants having mostly diagnosis classifications when episodic TTH classifications (57/98 and 32/35) are ignored. Strictly applying the ICHD-3 criteria on individual attacks does not yield good classification results. Adapted versions yield better results, with the mostly classified phenotype (migraine without aura vs. CH) matching the diagnosis for 12/18 patients. The absolute number of migraine without aura and CH classifications is, however, rather low. Example cases can be identified where activity and stress events explain patient-reported headache triggers. Continuous improvement of the data collection protocol, ML algorithms, and headache classification criteria (including the investigation of integrating physiological data), will further improve future headache follow-up, classification and trigger detection.

I propose that two basic classes of such factors be distinguished: biological and socio-cognitive. In my opinion, one of the most important among them is a sense of group membership with robots, as it modulates the empathic responses to representatives of our- and other- groups. The sense of group membership with robots may be co-shaped by socio-cognitive factors such as ones experience, familiarity with the robot and its history, motivation, accepted ontology, stereotypes or language.

According to behavioral economics and neuropsychology, empathy may be an inherent mechanism to elicit prosocial behaviors. Therefore, we establish a three-layer general framework of empathetic AI (eAI) with emotion, empathy, and decision-making. By introducing different sub-models, three learning structures based on eAI are proposed, including a gradient ascent (GA)-based structure, an adaptive learning structure, and a practical learning structure. The dynamics of the first two structures are analyzed theoretically, and the practical dynamics are tested in games. We prove that in the prisoners dilemma (PD) environment, the GA-based eAI with neutral assessment can carry out adaptive cooperation and competition under the premise of self-security. In addition, although the modeling of empathy by extracting the emotional contagion and limited cognitive regulation is simplified and primitive, tests in the prisoners dilemma, the ultimatum game, and a multi-agent dilemma game, show that the eAI structure successfully elicits prosocial behaviors including altruism, cooperation and fairness. Compared with other socialized algorithms, the eAI structure has a more comprehensive coverage in terms of convergence, fairness, security, adaptability, and structural expansibility. Therefore, we believe this work can provide novel methods and insights for regulating the behaviors of socialized agents, as well as artificial subjects in psychological and economic experiments.","2021","2022-07-15 09:48:07","2022-07-15 09:48:07","","6692-6722","","6","52","","","","","","","","","","English","","","/z-wcorg/","","http://worldcat.org","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Bibliometric and content analyses grounded on the health and nursing attributes and human-computer interaction framework were performed using MAXQDA. Finally, results were verified using critical friend feedback by a second reviewer. Most articles were from multiple authorship, published in non-nursing journals, and originating from developed economies. They primarily focused on applying healthcare robots in practice settings, physical health, and communication tasks. Using the human-computer interaction framework, it was found that older adults frequently served as the primary users while nurses, healthcare providers, and researchers functioned as secondary users and operators. Research articles focused on the usability, functionality, and acceptability of robotic systems. At the same time, theoretical papers explored the frameworks and the value of empathy and emotion in robots, human-computer interaction and nursing models and theories supporting healthcare practice, and gerontechnology. Current robotic systems are less anthropomorphic, operated through real-time direct and supervisory inputs, and mainly equipped with visual and auditory sensors and actuators with limited capability in performing health assessments.

The music in videos has a sensitive influence on human emotions, perception, and imaginations, which can make people feel relaxed or sad, and so on. Therefore, it is particularly important for people who make advertising videos to understand the relationship between the physical elements of music and empathy characteristics. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the music features in an advertising video and extract the music features that make people empathize. This paper combines both methods of the power spectrum of MFCC and image RGB analysis to find the audio feature vector. In spectral analysis, the eigenvectors obtained in the analysis process range from blue (low range) to green (medium range) to red (high range). The machine learning random forest classifier is used to classify the data obtained by machine learning, and the trained model is used to monitor the development of an advertisement empathy system in real time. The result is that the optimal model is obtained with the training accuracy result of 99.173% and a test accuracy of 86.171%, which can be deemed as correct by comparing the three models of audio feature value analysis. The contribution of this study can be summarized as follows: (1) the low-frequency and high-amplitude audio in the video is more likely to resonate than the high-frequency and high-amplitude audio; (2) it is found that frequency and audio amplitude are important attributes for describing waveforms by observing the characteristics of the machine learning classifier; (3) a new audio extraction method is proposed to induce human empathy. That is, the feature value extracted by the method of spectrogram image features of audio has the most ability to arouse human empathy.","2021","2022-07-15 09:48:07","2022-07-15 09:48:07","","","","21","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","/z-wcorg/","","http://worldcat.org","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Designed for long-term emotional engagement and to take the roles of friends, teachers, and babysitters, such robots have the potential to influence how children develop empathy. This article presents a review of the literature (20102020) in the fields of humanrobot interaction (HRI), psychology, neuropsychology, and roboethics, discussing the potential impact of communication with social robots on childrens social and emotional development. The critical analysis of evidence behind these discussions shows that, although robots theoretically have high chances of influencing the development of empathy in children, depending on their design, intensity, and context of use, there is no certainty about the kind of effect they might have. Most of the analyzed studies, which showed the ability of robots to improve empathy levels in children, were not longitudinal, while the studies observing and arguing for the negative effect of robots on childrens empathy were either purely theoretical or dependent on the specific design of the robot and the situation. Therefore, there is a need for studies investigating the effects on childrens social and emotional development of long-term regular and consistent communication with robots of various designs and in different situations.","2021","2022-07-15 09:48:07","2022-07-15 09:48:07","","1-11","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","/z-wcorg/","","http://worldcat.org","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Collectively, these have resulted in the modification of the physician's role as the gatekeeper for health care, increased shift-based care, and amplified interprofessional team-based care. Technological innovations present opportunities as well as challenges. Artificial intelligence, which has great potential, has already transformed some tasks, particularly those involving image interpretation. Ubiquitous access to information via the Internet by physicians and patients alike presents benefits as well as drawbacks: patients and providers have ready access to virtually all of human knowledge, but some websites are contaminated with misinformation and many people have difficulty differentiating between solid, evidence-based data and untruths. The role of the future physician will shift as complexity in health care increases and as artificial intelligence and other technologies advance. These technological advances demand new skills of physicians; memory and knowledge accumulation will diminish in importance while information management skills will become more important. In parallel, medical educators must enhance their teaching and assessment of critical human skills (e.g., clear communication, empathy) in the delivery of patient care. The authors emphasize the enduring role of critical human skills in safe and effective patient care even as medical practice is increasingly guided by artificial intelligence and related technology, and they suggest new and longitudinal ways of assessing essential noncognitive skills to meet the demands of the future. The authors envision practical and achievable benefits accruing to patients and providers if practitioners leverage technological advancements to facilitate the development of their critical human skills.","2021","2022-07-15 09:48:07","2022-07-15 09:48:07","","37-43","","1","96","","","","","","","","","","English","","","/z-wcorg/","","http://worldcat.org","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Additionally, it is argued that extant HRI research often fails to recognize the complexity of empathy and sympathy, such that the two concepts are frequently treated as synonymous. The arguments for these claims occur in two steps. First, it is argued that there are at least three understandings of empathy, such that particular care is needed when researching empathy in human-robot interactions. The phenomenological approach to empathyperhaps the least utilized of the three discussed understandingsis the approach with the most direct implications for moral standing. Furthermore, because empathy and sympathy are often conflated, a novel account of sympathy which makes clear the difference between the two concepts is presented, and the importance for these distinctions is argued for. In the second step, the phenomenological insights presented before regarding the nature of empathy are applied to the problem of robot moral standing to argue that empathetic and sympathetic engagement with an entity constitute an ethical engagement with it. The paper concludes by offering several potential research questions that result from the phenomenological analysis of empathy in human-robot interactions.","2022","2022-07-15 09:48:07","2022-07-15 09:48:07","","","","","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","/z-wcorg/","","http://worldcat.org","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, sensor data from commercial wearables are prone to noise, missing, or artifacts. Even with the recent interest in deploying commercial wearables for long-term studies, there does not exist a standardized way to process the raw sensor data and researchers often use highly specific functions to preprocess, clean, normalize, and compute features. This leads to a lack of uniformity and reproducibility across different studies, making it difficult to compare results. To overcome these issues, we present FLIRT: A Feature Generation Toolkit for Wearable Data; it is an open-source Python package that focuses on processing physiological data specifically from commercial wearables with all its challenges from data cleaning to feature extraction. FLIRT leverages a variety of state-of-the-art algorithms (e.g., particle filters, ML-based artifact detection) to ensure a robust preprocessing of physiological data from wearables. In a subsequent step, FLIRT utilizes a sliding-window approach and calculates a feature vector of more than 100 dimensions - a basis for a wide variety of ML algorithms. We evaluated FLIRT on the publicly available WESAD dataset, which focuses on stress detection with an Empatica E4 wearable. Preprocessing the data with FLIRT ensures that unintended noise and artifacts are appropriately filtered. In the classification task, FLIRT outperforms the preprocessing baseline of the original WESAD paper. FLIRT provides functionalities beyond existing packages that can address unmet needs in physiological data processing and feature generation: (a) integrated handling of common wearable file formats (e.g., Empatica E4 archives), (b) robust preprocessing, and (c) standardized feature generation that ensures reproducibility of results. Nevertheless, while FLIRT comes with a default configuration to accommodate most situations, it offers a highly configurable interface for all of its implemented algorithms to account for specific needs.","2021","2022-07-15 09:48:08","2022-07-15 09:48:08","","106461","","","212","","","","","","","","","","English","","","/z-wcorg/","","http://worldcat.org","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Pediatric neurological and psychological conditions can affect social cognition and require assessment and remediation of social skills. To adequately approximate the complex and dynamic nature of real-world social interactions, innovative tools are needed. The aim of this study was to document the performance of adolescents on two versions of a serious video game presenting realistic, everyday, socio-moral conflicts, and to explore whether their performance is associated with empathy or sense of presence, factors known to influence social cognition. Participants (12-17 years, M = 14.39; SD = 1.35) first completed a pre-test measure of socio-moral reasoning based on three dilemmas from a previously validated computer task. Then, they either played an evaluative version (n = 24) or an adaptive (n = 33) version of a video game presenting nine social situations in which they made socio-moral decisions and provided justifications. In the evaluative version, participants' audio justifications were recorded verbatim and coded manually to obtain a socio-moral reasoning maturity score. In the adaptive version (AV), tailored feedback and social reinforcements were provided based on participant responses. An automatic coding algorithm developed using artificial intelligence was used to determine socio-moral maturity level in real-time and to provide a basis for the feedback and reinforcements in the game. All participants then completed a three-dilemma post-test assessment. Those who played the adaptive version showed improved SMR across the pre-test, in-game and post-test moral maturity scores, F(1.97,63.00) = 9.81, pHF < 0.001, 2 = 0.21, but those who played the Evaluative version did not. Socio-moral reasoning scores from both versions combined did not correlate with empathy or sense of presence during the game, though results neared significance. The study findings support preliminary validation of the game as a promising method for assessing and remediating social skills during adolescence.","2021","2022-07-15 09:48:08","2022-07-15 09:48:08","","767596","","","12","","","","","","","","","","English","","","/z-wcorg/","","http://worldcat.org","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Advertising designers have concerned that physical attributes in the video affect the viewers empathy and determine their purchase decisions. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to provide an advertisement guideline, that increasing viewers empathy by controlling the physical elements and together considering the objective biological data of the viewers gaze tracking. This article uses two methods for comparison accuracy. The first method is about using eye-tracking data to derive areas of interest in the video and to evaluate empathy with the image properties in the advertisement. The physical elements of the advertising pictures, such as characteristics of color, saturation, and value have been analyzed by comparing between advertising videos with and without consideration of gaze tracking for the region of interest of the video. Then the empathy in advertising has been determined by using the method of machine learning classification. The results showed that the accuracy rate was 1.8% higher than the other kinds of videos in feature value of considering the region of interest extraction by gaze tracking. Contribution: (1). The physical elements in the advertisement contribute to increase the viewers empathy; (2). The paper also finds that the video making by the method of extracting physical elements of some region of interest has a stronger influence on the viewers empathy; (3). The decision of physical elements in advertisements can increase the empathy of viewers during viewing processes, which can also improve the effectiveness of advertisements.","2021","2022-07-15 09:48:08","2022-07-15 09:48:08","","2241-2257","","2","81","","","","","","","","","","English","","","/z-wcorg/","","http://worldcat.org","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of this study was to investigate the determinants of positive sentiment expressed in hospital Facebook reviews in Malaysia, as well as the association between hospital accreditation and sentiments expressed in Facebook reviews. From 2017 to 2019, we retrieved comments from 48 official public hospitals' Facebook pages. We used machine learning to build a sentiment analyzer and service quality (SERVQUAL) classifier that automatically classifies the sentiment and SERVQUAL dimensions. We utilized logistic regression analysis to determine our goals. We evaluated a total of 1852 reviews and our machine learning sentiment analyzer detected 72.1% of positive reviews and 27.9% of negative reviews. We classified 240 reviews as tangible, 1257 reviews as trustworthy, 125 reviews as responsive, 356 reviews as assurance, and 1174 reviews as empathy using our machine learning SERVQUAL classifier. After adjusting for hospital characteristics, all SERVQUAL dimensions except Tangible were associated with positive sentiment. However, no significant relationship between hospital accreditation and online sentiment was discovered. Facebook reviews powered by machine learning algorithms provide valuable, real-time data that may be missed by traditional hospital quality assessments. Additionally, online patient reviews offer a hitherto untapped indication of quality that may benefit all healthcare stakeholders. Our results confirm prior studies and support the use of Facebook reviews as an adjunct method for assessing the quality of hospital services in Malaysia.","2021","2022-07-15 09:48:08","2022-07-15 09:48:08","","","","18","18","","","","","","","","","","English","","","/z-wcorg/","","http://worldcat.org","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Notwithstanding, AI is finding its way into numerous aspects of humanity including the fast-growing helping profession of coaching. Coaching has been shown to be efficacious in a variety of human development facets. The application of AI in a narrow, specific area of coaching has also been shown to work. What remains uncertain, is how the two compare. In this paper we compare two equivalent longitudinal randomised control trial studies that measured the increase in clients' goal attainment as a result of having received coaching over a 10-month period. The first study involved human coaches and the replication study used an AI chatbot coach. In both studies, human coaches and the AI coach were significantly more effective in helping clients reach their goals compared to the two control groups. Surprisingly however, the AI coach was as effective as human coaches at the end of the trials. We interpret this result using AI and goal theory and present three significant implications: AI coaching could be scaled to democratize coaching; AI coaching could grow the demand for human coaching; and AI could replace human coaches who use simplistic, model-based coaching approaches. At present, AI's lack of empathy and emotional intelligence make human coaches irreplicable. However, understanding the efficacy of AI coaching relative to human coaching may promote the focused use of AI, to the significant benefit of society.","2022","2022-07-15 09:48:08","2022-07-15 09:48:08","","e0270255","","6","17","","","","","","","","","","English","","","/z-wcorg/","","http://worldcat.org","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Technological advancements are taking place at an incredible pace, largely due to AI or AI-backed systems. It is likely that there will be a massive explosion or ""Cambrian explosion"" of AI in our everyday life, largely aided by increased funding and resources spent on research and development. AI has also significantly revolutionized the medical field. The concept of machine learning and deep learning in AI is the crux of its success. In surgical practice, AI has numerous applications in the diagnosis of disease, preoperative planning, intraoperative assistance, surgical training and assessment, and robotics. The potential automation of surgery is also a possibility in the next few decades. However, at present, augmentation rather than automation should be the priority. In spite of the allure of AI, it comes with its own price. A robot lacks the ""sixth sense"" or intuition that is crucial in the practice of surgery and medicine. Empathy and human touch are also inimitable characteristics that cannot be replaced by an AI system. Other limitations include the financial burden and the feasibility of using such technology on a wide scale. Ethical and legal dilemmas such as those involving privacy laws are other issues that should be taken under consideration. Despite all these limitations, with the way technology is progressing, it is inevitable that AI and automation will completely change the way we practice surgery in the near future.

The emerging challenge now is the selection of most discriminative information from high-dimensional data collected from multiple sources. The available fusion algorithms with their complex structure are poorly adopted to the computationally constrained environment which requires integrating information directly at the source. As a result, more simple low-level fusion methods are needed. In the absence of a data combining process, the cost of directly applying high-dimensional raw data to a deep classifier would be computationally expensive with regard to the response time, energy consumption, and memory requirement. Taking this into account, we aimed to develop a data fusion technique in a computationally efficient way to achieve a more comprehensive insight of human activity dynamics in a lower dimension. The major objective was considering statistical dependency of multisensory data and exploring intermodality correlation patterns for different activities. In this technique, the information in time (regardless of the number of sources) is transformed into a 2D space that facilitates classification of eating episodes from others. This is based on a hypothesis that data captured by various sensors are statistically associated with each other and the covariance matrix of all these signals has a unique distribution correlated with each activity which can be encoded on a contour representation. These representations are then used as input of a deep model to learn specific patterns associated with specific activity. In order to show the generalizability of the proposed fusion algorithm, 2 different scenarios were taken into account. These scenarios were different in terms of temporal segment size, type of activity, wearable device, subjects, and deep learning architecture. The first scenario used a data set in which a single participant performed a limited number of activities while wearing the Empatica E4 wristband. In the second scenario, a data set related to the activities of daily living was used where 10 different participants wore inertial measurement units while performing a more complex set of activities. The precision metric obtained from leave-one-subject-out cross-validation for the second scenario reached 0.803. The impact of missing data on performance degradation was also evaluated. To conclude, the proposed fusion technique provides the possibility of embedding joint variability information over different modalities in just a single 2D representation which results in obtaining a more global view of different aspects of daily human activities at hand, and yet preserving the desired performance level in activity recognition.","2021","2022-07-15 09:48:08","2022-07-15 09:48:08","","e21926","","1","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","/z-wcorg/","","http://worldcat.org","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Netnography method is used for data collection. Connotation key words are used for selection of comments and tweets. The study concludes that organizations respond to the most of the complaints publically but they further ask for the personal interaction with the complainer to resolve the complaint through pre-defined statements. The study has also revealed that pre-defined statements stated by autobots based on artificial intelligence seem insufficient to resolve customer complaints. The limitation of the study is associated with the netnography technique, which has restricted the exploration to only those consumers who have posted comments on Twitter or Facebook. Hence, other physical factors i.e. customer responses through numerous offline modes were absconded. The study is limited to Facebook and Twitter only. This study is limited to four major online shopping portals; it leaves a lot of scope to analyze other industries such as banking and insurance, hospitality, aviation etc. The output of the study suggests that the firms need to be conscious enough to provide customized and adaptive solutions to the customers complaints instead of pre-defined responses through artificial intelligence as it lacks emotions to empathize with customers issues. As per the literature of review, methods chosen in previous researches by researchers were having a methodological gap, as netnography in social media environment remained unused earlier, which has reinforced to analyze original behavior of customers and responsiveness of organization.","2021","2022-07-15 09:48:08","2022-07-15 09:48:08","","","","1","1116","","","","","","","","","","English","","","/z-wcorg/","","http://worldcat.org","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots have a strong potential in optimizing such programs for weight loss. This study aimed to review AI chatbot use cases for weight loss and to identify the essential components for prolonging user engagement. A scoping review was conducted using the 5-stage framework by Arksey and O'Malley. Articles were searched across nine electronic databases (ACM Digital Library, CINAHL, Cochrane Central, Embase, IEEE Xplore, PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) until July 9, 2021. Gray literature, reference lists, and Google Scholar were also searched. A total of 23 studies with 2231 participants were included and evaluated in this review. Most studies (8/23, 35%) focused on using AI chatbots to promote both a healthy diet and exercise, 13% (3/23) of the studies used AI chatbots solely for lifestyle data collection and obesity risk assessment whereas only 4% (1/23) of the studies focused on promoting a combination of a healthy diet, exercise, and stress management. In total, 48% (11/23) of the studies used only text-based AI chatbots, 52% (12/23) operationalized AI chatbots through smartphones, and 39% (9/23) integrated data collected through fitness wearables or Internet of Things appliances. The core functions of AI chatbots were to provide personalized recommendations (20/23, 87%), motivational messages (18/23, 78%), gamification (6/23, 26%), and emotional support (6/23, 26%). Study participants who experienced speech- and augmented reality-based chatbot interactions in addition to text-based chatbot interactions reported higher user engagement because of the convenience of hands-free interactions. Enabling conversations through multiple platforms (eg, SMS text messaging, Slack, Telegram, Signal, WhatsApp, or Facebook Messenger) and devices (eg, laptops, Google Home, and Amazon Alexa) was reported to increase user engagement. The human semblance of chatbots through verbal and nonverbal cues improved user engagement through interactivity and empathy. Other techniques used in text-based chatbots included personally and culturally appropriate colloquial tones and content; emojis that emulate human emotional expressions; positively framed words; citations of credible information sources; personification; validation; and the provision of real-time, fast, and reliable recommendations. Prevailing issues included privacy; accountability; user burden; and interoperability with other databases, third-party applications, social media platforms, devices, and appliances. AI chatbots should be designed to be human-like, personalized, contextualized, immersive, and enjoyable to enhance user experience, engagement, behavior change, and weight loss. These require the integration of health metrics (eg, based on self-reports and wearable trackers), personality and preferences (eg, based on goal achievements), circumstantial behaviors (eg, trigger-based overconsumption), and emotional states (eg, chatbot conversations and wearable stress detectors) to deliver personalized and effective recommendations for weight loss.","2022","2022-07-15 09:48:08","2022-07-15 09:48:08","","e32578","","4","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","/z-wcorg/","","http://worldcat.org","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Perceptions of AI are less well-known, notably amongst children and young people (CYP). This workshop investigates attitudes towards AI and its future applications in medicine and healthcare at a specialised paediatric hospital using practical design scenarios. Twenty-one members of a Young Persons Advisory Group for research contributed to an engagement workshop to ascertain potential opportunities, apprehensions, and priorities. When presented as a selection of practical design scenarios, we found that CYP were more open to some applications of AI in healthcare than others. Human-centeredness, governance and trust emerged as early themes, with empathy and safety considered as important when introducing AI to healthcare. Educational workshops with practical examples using AI to help, but not replace humans were suggested to address issues, build trust, and effectively communicate about AI. Whilst policy guidelines acknowledge the need to include children and young people to develop AI, this requires an enabling environment for human-centred AI involving children and young people with lived experiences of healthcare. Future research should focus on building consensus on enablers for an intelligent healthcare system designed for the next generation, which fundamentally, allows co-creation. Children and young people (CYP) want to be included to share their insights about the development of research on the potential role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in medicine and healthcare and are more open to some applications of AI than others. Whilst it is acknowledged that a research gap on involving and engaging CYP in developing AI policies exists, there is little in the way of pragmatic and practical guidance for healthcare staff on this topic. This requires research on enabling environments for ongoing digital cooperation to identify and prioritise unmet needs in the application and development of AI.","2022","2022-07-15 09:48:08","2022-07-15 09:48:08","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","/z-wcorg/","","http://worldcat.org","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While these technologies in psychotherapy are growing, the circumstances of accepting artificial tools during psychotherapy need to be explored to improve effective AI tools during the sensitive therapeutic environment. In this study, the factors around the preferences for AI-based psychotherapy were investigated. This cross-sectional study was conducted with a sample of 872 individuals who are highly educated, 18 aged and above. Attitude towards AI-based Psychotherapy, Attitude towards Seeking Professional Psychological Help Scale- Short Form, and Stigma Scale for Receiving Psychological Help Scale were used to examine the factors of participants' preferences for AI-based psychotherapy. While 55% of the sample preferred AI-based psychotherapy, the majority of participants trusted more human psychotherapists than AI-based systems when asked participants trust about the security of personal data. However, three important benefits of AI-based psychotherapy were identified as being able to comfortably talk about the embarrassing experiences, having accessibility at any time, and accessing remote communication. Importantly, factors of preferences for AI-based psychotherapy were related to the idea of AI-based psychotherapy systems can improve themselves based on the results from previous therapeutic experiences. Gender and the types of profession related to psychology and technical/engineering were also associated with choosing AI-based psychotherapy. The results suggest that both raising awareness of the benefits and effectiveness of psychotherapy as well as the trust to the artificial intelligence tools can improve the rate of the preferences for AI-based psychotherapy.<br> We explored the factors of choosing AI-based psychotherapy.  The less stigma and remote access were found as key in preferring AI-based therapy.  Trust of the security of data in AI-based therapy were less than human therapists.

Here we surveyed United States adults (n = 1,061) on their views regarding granting 1) general legal protection, 2) legal personhood, and 3) standing to bring forth a lawsuit, with respect to sentient AI and eight other groups: humans in the jurisdiction, humans outside the jurisdiction, corporations, unions, non-human animals, the environment, humans living in the near future, and humans living in the far future. Roughly one-third of participants endorsed granting personhood and standing to sentient AI (assuming its existence) in at least some cases, the lowest of any group surveyed on, and rated the desired level of protection for sentient AI as lower than all groups other than corporations. We further investigated and observed political differences in responses; liberals were more likely to endorse legal protection and personhood for sentient AI than conservatives. Taken together, these results suggest that laypeople are not by-and-large in favor of granting legal protection to AI, and that the ordinary conception of legal status, similar to codified legal doctrine, is not based on a mere capacity to feel pleasure and pain. At the same time, the observed political differences suggest that previous literature regarding political differences in empathy and moral circle expansion apply to artificially intelligent systems and extend partially, though not entirely, to legal consideration, as well.","2021","2022-07-15 09:48:08","2022-07-15 09:48:08","","788355","","","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","/z-wcorg/","","http://worldcat.org","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the perceptions and needs of such systems remain elusive, hindering efforts to promote AI adoption in health care. This study aims to provide an overview of the perceptions and needs of AI to increase its adoption in health care. A systematic scoping review was conducted according to the 5-stage framework by Arksey and O'Malley. Articles that described the perceptions and needs of AI in health care were searched across nine databases: ACM Library, CINAHL, Cochrane Central, Embase, IEEE Xplore, PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science for studies that were published from inception until June 21, 2021. Articles that were not specific to AI, not research studies, and not written in English were omitted. Of the 3666 articles retrieved, 26 (0.71%) were eligible and included in this review. The mean age of the participants ranged from 30 to 72.6 years, the proportion of men ranged from 0% to 73.4%, and the sample sizes for primary studies ranged from 11 to 2780. The perceptions and needs of various populations in the use of AI were identified for general, primary, and community health care; chronic diseases self-management and self-diagnosis; mental health; and diagnostic procedures. The use of AI was perceived to be positive because of its availability, ease of use, and potential to improve efficiency and reduce the cost of health care service delivery. However, concerns were raised regarding the lack of trust in data privacy, patient safety, technological maturity, and the possibility of full automation. Suggestions for improving the adoption of AI in health care were highlighted: enhancing personalization and customizability; enhancing empathy and personification of AI-enabled chatbots and avatars; enhancing user experience, design, and interconnectedness with other devices; and educating the public on AI capabilities. Several corresponding mitigation strategies were also identified in this study. The perceptions and needs of AI in its use in health care are crucial in improving its adoption by various stakeholders. Future studies and implementations should consider the points highlighted in this study to enhance the acceptability and adoption of AI in health care. This would facilitate an increase in the effectiveness and efficiency of health care service delivery to improve patient outcomes and satisfaction.","2022","2022-07-15 09:48:08","2022-07-15 09:48:08","","e32939","","1","24","","","","","","","","","","English","","","/z-wcorg/","","http://worldcat.org","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For a robot to apply a matching emotion in humanrobot communication, the robot needs to be able to understand human feelings. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to improve the human impression of the robot using a robot that expresses human-like expressions by synchronizing with human biological information and changing the expressions in real time. We first measured and estimated human emotions using an emotion estimation method based on biological information (brain waves and heartbeats). The three-emotion estimation methods were proposed and evaluated in the preliminary experiment. Among the three-emotion estimation methods proposed, the one that yields the highest impression rating was chosen to be used in the second experiment which was based on the emotional value in each cycle method. Then, we developed a robot that shows expressions in two patterns: (1) synchronized emotion (same emotion as subject conveyed) and (2) inversed emotion with the human. The subjects evaluated the robots expression from both patterns using semantic differential (SD) method while having their biological information measured based on the selected emotion estimation method from previous preliminary experiment. The evaluation by SD method and biological information results showed that when the human experienced the happiness emotion, and the robot synchronized and expressed the same emotion, this could increase the intimacy between human and robot. Here, it can be said that the impression created by the robots expression can be improved using biological information.","2021","2022-07-15 09:48:08","2022-07-15 09:48:08","","379-389","","4","26","","","","","","","","","","English","","","/z-wcorg/","","http://worldcat.org","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Conversational agents/chatbots are increasingly common, although little is known about how this technology could aid services. This study aimed to identify barriers and facilitators for engagement with sexual health chatbots to advise service developers and related health professionals. Methods In January-June 2020, we conducted face-to-face, semi-structured and online interviews to explore views on sexual health chatbots. Participants were asked to interact with a chatbot, offering advice on sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and relevant services. Participants were UK-based and recruited via social media. Data were recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically. Results Forty participants (aged 18-50 years; 64% women, 77% heterosexual, 58% white) took part. Many thought chatbots could aid sex education, providing useful information about STIs and sign-posting to sexual health services in a convenient, anonymous and non-judgemental way. Some compared chatbots to health professionals or Internet search engines and perceived this technology as inferior, offering constrained content and interactivity, limiting disclosure of personal information, trust and perceived accuracy of chatbot responses. Conclusions Despite mixed attitudes towards chatbots, this technology was seen as useful for anonymous sex education but less suitable for matters requiring empathy. Chatbots may increase access to clinical services but their effectiveness and safety need to be established. Future research should identify which chatbots designs and functions lead to optimal engagement with this innovation.","2021","2022-07-15 09:48:08","2022-07-15 09:48:08","","385-393","","5","18","","","","","","","","","","English","","","/z-wcorg/","","http://worldcat.org","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Given that chatbot services infused with domain knowledge are of great interest to not only global businesses but also academics, chatbots have in recent years become a popular research topic in the field of natural language processing. We therefore aim at improving current chatbots with the addition of natural emotions. In contrast to previous work, we intend to distinguish fine-grained emotion differences between words in order to better understand emotion expressions in sentences. Our approach infuses fine-grained emotion content into the response generation process to make the dialog more emotionally resonant. The experimental results demonstrate that this method can classify emotions more effectively. In addition, the proposed hybrid model, which consists of recurrent and convolutional neural networks with additional emotion-specific valence-arousal features, can correctly identify five emotions with a 67.89% overall F1-score. We further evaluate the subjective quality of the responses and discover that the infusion of fine-grained emotion information substantially improves the quality and fluency of automatically generated empathetic conversation.

One such approach involves asking participants to inflict 'harm' on a robot. Researchers are interested in the length of time between the experimenter issuing the instruction and the participant complying, and propose that relatively long periods of hesitation might reflect empathy for the robot, and perhaps even attribution of human-like qualities, such as agency and sentience. In a recent experiment, we adapted the so-called 'hesitance to hit' paradigm, in which participants were instructed to hit a humanoid robot on the head with a mallet. After standing up to do so (signaling intent to hit the robot), participants were stopped, and then took part in a semi-structured interview to probe their thoughts and feelings during the period of hesitation. Thematic analysis of the responses indicate that hesitation not only reflects perceived socialness, but also other factors including (but not limited to) concerns about cost, mallet disbelief, processing of the task instruction, and the influence of authority. The open-ended, free responses participants provided also offer rich insights into individual differences with regards to anthropomorphism, perceived power imbalances, and feelings of connection toward the robot. In addition to aiding understanding of this measurement technique and related topics regarding socialness attribution to robots, we argue that greater use of open questions can lead to exciting new research questions and interdisciplinary collaborations in the domain of social robotics.","2021","2022-07-15 09:48:08","2022-07-15 09:48:08","","603510","","","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","/z-wcorg/","","http://worldcat.org","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous studies have shown that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is effective in improving attention deficit symptoms. However, many patients are not receiving adequate treatment due to time, space, and cost constraints. Recently, in other mental illnesses, mobile-based chatbots delivering CBT and psychoeducation have been used for symptom mitigation and treatment. This study aimed to investigate the feasibility and usability of a short-term intervention, specifically a mobile-based interactive chatbot application, in alleviating attention deficit symptoms. This was a randomized, non-blind parallel-group pilot study conducted from September 2019 to March 2020. Forty-six individuals with attention deficit aged 19-60 were randomly allocated to the chatbot (n=23) and information-only control groups (n=23) for 4 weeks. The former group was instructed to use the chatbot application ""Todaki,"" while the latter group was provided with a book on managing attention deficit symptoms. Participants were administered questionnaires to assess their symptoms of attention deficit, depression, and anxiety and evaluated at baseline and 4 weeks after the intervention. The post-intervention survey assessed the chatbot's usability, acceptability, and side effects. The average age of the participants was 25.1 years (standard deviation [SD] 7.5 years), and 56.5 % (26/46) participants were female. Intention-to-treat analysis (chatbot, n=23; control, n=23) revealed a significant reduction of attention deficit symptoms only in the chatbot group, which is represented by group-by-time interaction in Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale subscales of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-IV Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Hyperactive-Impulsive symptoms (F=4.39; p=.04) and ADHD symptoms total (F=6.74, p=.01). Further, the results of the paired t-test were significant only in the chatbot group. The average number of times the chatbots were used in 4 weeks was 20.32 (SD 12.89). The total average usage time was 1h 15min (SD 1h 20min). The degree of improvement in the ADHD symptoms total score was correlated with the number of times the psychoeducation program was used. According to the participants, the empathic/friendly character and unnatural flow of conversation were the best and worst features of the chatbot, respectively. This study identified the feasibility and usability of using the mobile-based chatbot to improve attention deficit and its associated psychiatric symptoms. Using this novel intervention to conduct CBT would provide a useful digital therapeutic tool that allows easy accessibility and self-guided management for people with attention deficit, which should be verified through the large scale randomized controlled trial.","2021","2022-07-15 09:48:08","2022-07-15 09:48:08","","104440","","","150","","","","","","","","","","English","","","/z-wcorg/","","http://worldcat.org","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although past studies achieved ways to express emotions through a robot's touch, such studies focused on expressing such basic emotions as happiness and sadness and downplayed these complex emotions. Such studies only proposed a model that expresses these emotions by touch behaviors without evaluations. Therefore, we conducted the experiment to evaluate the model with participants.

The aim of this paper is to investigate whether human-beings trust a social robot-i.e. a human-like robot that embodies emotional states, empathy, and non-verbal communication-differently than other types of agents. To do so, we adapt the well-known economic trust-game proposed by Charness and Dufwenberg (2006) to assess whether receiving a promise from a robot increases human-trust in it. We find that receiving a promise from the robot increases the trust of the human in it, but only for individuals who perceive the robot very similar to a human-being. Importantly, we observe a similar pattern in choices when we replace the humanoid counterpart with a real human but not when it is replaced by a computer-box.

Nowadays, the development of artificial intelligence (AI) and cognitive technologies coupled with the rapid spread of messaging platforms and mobile technology with easier access to internet technology offers professional dietitians an opportunity to provide extensive monitoring support to their clients through a chatbot with artificial empathy. This study aimed to design a chatbot with artificial empathic motivational support for weight loss called ""SlimMe"" and investigate how people react to a diet bot. The SlimMe infrastructure was built using Dialogflow as the natural language processing (NLP) platform and LINE mobile messenger as the messaging platform. We proposed a text-based emotion analysis to simulate artificial empathy responses to recognize the user's emotion. A preliminary evaluation was performed to investigate the early-stage user experience after a 7-day simulation trial. The result revealed that having an artificially empathic diet bot for weight loss management is a fun and exciting experience. The use of emoticons, stickers, and GIF images makes the chatbot response more interactive. Moreover, the motivational support and persuasive messaging features enable the bot to express more empathic and engaging responses to the user. In total, there were 1,007 bot responses from 892 user input messages. Of these, 67.38% (601/1,007) of the chatbot-generated responses were accurate to a relevant user request, 21.19% (189/1,007) inaccurate responses to a relevant request, and 10.31% (92/1,007) accurate responses to an irrelevant request. Only 1.12% (10/1,007) of the chatbot does not answer. We present the design of an artificially empathic diet bot as a friendly assistant to help users estimate their calorie intake and calories burned in a more interactive and engaging way. To our knowledge, this is the first chatbot designed with artificial empathy features, and it looks very promising in promoting long-term weight management. More user interactions and further data training and validation enhancement will improve the bot's in-built knowledge base and emotional intelligence base.","2022","2022-07-15 09:48:08","2022-07-15 09:48:08","","870775","","","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","/z-wcorg/","","http://worldcat.org","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this paper is to investigate whether human-beings trust a social roboti.e. a human-like robot that embodies emotional states, empathy, and non-verbal communicationdifferently than other types of agents. To do so, we adapt the well-known economic trust-game proposed by Charness and Dufwenberg (2006) to assess whether receiving a promise from a robot increases human-trust in it. We find that receiving a promise from the robot increases the trust of the human in it, but only for individuals who perceive the robot very similar to a human-being. Importantly, we observe a similar pattern in choices when we replace the humanoid counterpart with a real human but not when it is replaced by a computer-box.

However, a considerable number of study results point in the opposite direction. There is currently no comprehensive common ground on the circumstances under which anthropomorphism promotes interaction with robots. Our meta-analysis aims to close this gap. A total of 4856 abstracts were scanned. After an extensive evaluation, 78 studies involving around 6000 participants and 187 effect sizes were included in this meta-analysis. The majority of the studies addressed effects on perceptual aspects of robots. In addition, effects on attitudinal, affective, and behavioral aspects were also investigated. Overall, a medium positive effect size was found, indicating a beneficial effect of anthropomorphic design features on human-related outcomes. However, closer scrutiny of the lowest variable level revealed no positive effect for perceived safety, empathy, and task performance. Moreover, the analysis suggests that positive effects of anthropomorphism depend heavily on various moderators. For example, anthropomorphism was in contrast to other fields of application, constantly facilitating social HRI. The results of this analysis provide insights into how design features can be used to improve the quality of HRI. Moreover, they reveal areas in which more research is needed before any clear conclusions about the effects of anthropomorphic robot design can be drawn.","2021","2022-07-15 09:48:08","2022-07-15 09:48:08","","eabj5425","","58","6","","","","","","","","","","English","","","/z-wcorg/","","http://worldcat.org","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

But the fact that the term empathy has strong social connotations raises a question: can it be applied to robots? Can we actually use social terms and explanations in relation to these inanimate machines? In this article, I analyse the range of uses of the term empathy in the field of HRI studies and social robotics, and consider the substantial, functional and relational positions on this issue. I focus on the relational (cooperational) perspective presented by Luisa Damiano and Paul Dumouchel, who interpret emotions (together with empathy) as being the result of affective coordination. I also reflect on the criteria that should be used to determine when, in such relations, we are dealing with actual empathy.","2021","2022-07-15 09:48:08","2022-07-15 09:48:08","","1-16","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","/z-wcorg/","","http://worldcat.org","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Beyond our perception, they play an integral role in our emotional processing, learning, and interpretation. They are what help us to sculpt our everyday experiences and can be triggered by aesthetics to form the foundations of our interactions with each other and our surroundings. In terms of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), robots have the possibility to interact with both people and environments given their senses. They can offer the attributes of human characteristics, which in turn can make the interchange with technology a more appealing and admissible experience. However, for many reasons, people still do not seem to trust and accept robots. Trust is expressed as a persons ability to accept the potential risks associated with participating alongside an entity such as a robot. Whilst trust is an important factor in building relationships with robots, the presence of uncertainties can add an additional dimension to the decision to trust a robot. In order to begin to understand how to build trust with robots and reverse the negative ideology, this paper examines the influences of aesthetic design techniques on the human ability to trust robots. Method This paper explores the potential that robots have unique opportunities to improve their facilities for empathy, emotion, and social awareness beyond their more cognitive functionalities. Through conducting an online questionnaire distributed globally, we explored participants ability and acceptance in trusting the Canbot U03 robot. Participants were presented with a range of visual questions which manipulated the robots facial screen and asked whether or not they would trust the robot. A selection of questions aimed at putting participants in situations where they were required to establish whether or not to trust a robots responses based solely on the visual appearance. We accomplished this by manipulating different design elements of the robots facial and chest screens, which influenced the human-robot interaction. Results We found that certain facial aesthetics seem to be more trustworthy than others, such as a cartoon face versus a human face, and that certain visual variables (i.e., blur) afforded uncertainty more than others. Consequentially, this paper reports that participants uncertainties of the visualisations greatly influenced their willingness to accept and trust the robot. The results of introducing certain anthropomorphic characteristics emphasised the participants embrace of the uncanny valley theory, where pushing the degree of human likeness introduced a thin line between participants accepting robots and not. By understanding what manipulation of design elements created the aesthetic effect that triggered the affective processes, this paper further enriches our knowledge of how we might design for certain emotions, feelings, and ultimately more socially acceptable and trusting robotic experiences.","2022","2022-07-15 09:48:08","2022-07-15 09:48:08","","e837","","","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","/z-wcorg/","","http://worldcat.org","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, little is known about the mechanisms and boundary conditions that shape this effect. This study examines how the embodiment of both outgroup and ingroup VR avatars in different orders influences attitudes and perceived closeness toward a co-ethnic immigrant outgroup in Singapore. It also investigates the role of empathy and social identity orientation (SIO) in this relationship. An experiment with four avatar embodiment conditions (ingroup-then-outgroup, outgroup-then-ingroup, ingroup-only, and outgroup-only) was carried out with 171 participants from a public university in Singapore. Results showed that embodying an outgroup avatar alone, compared to embodying an ingroup avatar alone, significantly improves both attitudes and closeness toward an immigrant outgroup. The order of embodiment matters to an extent, suggesting the greater effectiveness of outgroup-first over ingroup-first embodiment in reducing bias. Empathy mediates the effect of all three outgroup embodiment conditions on improved attitudes and closeness toward immigrants. It was also found that the stronger one's SIO is, the more effective embodiment is in improving perceived closeness with the outgroup via empathy. Theoretical implications of these findings are discussed.","2021","2022-07-15 09:48:08","2022-07-15 09:48:08","","705574","","","12","","","","","","","","","","English","","","/z-wcorg/","","http://worldcat.org","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Discussing empathy in HRI requires a shift in human perspective, as only scarce traces of the concept are detected. While a key perspective on empathy is caring for the other person, empathy in HRI does have a conceptual potential.

As already verified in a preliminary phase of the research, user impressions, collected as subjective evaluation in a controlled experiment, are positive and encourage further steps, like the evaluation of other inferences on users.","2021","2022-07-15 09:48:08","2022-07-15 09:48:08","","115-121","","","152","","","","","","","","","","English","","","/z-wcorg/","","http://worldcat.org","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"LBVS9GU6","journalArticle","2022","Ostherr, Kirsten,","Artificial Intelligence and Medical Humanities.","J Med Humanit The Journal of medical humanities","","1041-3545","","","The use of artificial intelligence in healthcare has led to debates about the role of human clinicians in the increasingly technological contexts of medicine. Some researchers have argued that AI will augment the capacities of physicians and increase their availability to provide empathy and other uniquely human forms of care to their patients. The human vulnerabilities experienced in the healthcare context raise the stakes of new technologies such as AI, and the human dimensions of AI in healthcare have particular significance for research in the humanities. This article explains four key areas of concern relating to AI and the role that medical/health humanities research can play in addressing them: definition and regulation of ""medical"" versus ""health"" data and apps; social determinants of health; narrative medicine; and technological mediation of care. Issues include data privacy and trust, flawed datasets and algorithmic bias, racial discrimination, and the rhetoric of humanism and disability. Through a discussion of potential humanities contributions to these emerging intersections with AI, this article will suggest future scholarly directions for the field.","2022","2022-07-15 09:48:08","2022-07-15 09:48:08","","211-232","","2","43","","","","","","","","","","English","","","/z-wcorg/","","http://worldcat.org","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The present study aimed to explore the predictors of compassion fatigue among a high-risk population of psychological hotline counselors. Seven hundred and twelve psychological hotline counselors were recruited from the Mental Health Service Platform at Central China Normal University, Ministry of Education, then were asked to complete the questionnaires measuring compassion fatigue, trait empathy, social support, trait mindfulness, counselor's self-efficacy, humor, life meaning, and post-traumatic growth. A chi-square test was utilized to filter for the top-20 predictive variables. Machine learning techniques, including logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, k-nearest neighbor, support vector machine, and naï¿½ï¿½ve Bayes were employed to predict compassion fatigue. The results showed that the most important predictors of compassion fatigue were meaning in life, counselors' self-efficacy, mindfulness, and empathy. Except for the decision tree, the rest machine learning techniques obtained good performance. Naï¿½ï¿½ve Bayes presented the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.803. Random forest achieved the least classification error of 23.64, followed by Naï¿½ï¿½ve Bayes with a classification error of 23.85. These findings support the potential application of machine learning techniques in the prediction of compassion fatigue.

In social neuroscience, many experiments have sought to first define and then locate 'perspective taking', 'empathy', and other psychological concepts to specific brain circuits. Seldom, bottom-up studies were conducted to first identify explanatory patterns of brain variation, which are then related to psychological concepts; perhaps due to a lack of large population datasets. In this spirit, we performed a systematic de-construction of social brain morphology into its elementary building blocks, involving ~10,000 UK Biobank participants. We explored coherent representations of structural co-variation at population scale within a recent social brain atlas, by translating autoencoder neural networks from deep learning. The learned subnetworks revealed essential patterns of structural relationships between social brain regions, with the nucleus accumbens, medial prefrontal cortex, and temporoparietal junction embedded at the core. Some of the uncovered subnetworks contributed to predicting examined social traits in general, while other subnetworks helped predict specific facets of social functioning, such as the experience of social isolation. As a consequence of our population-level evidence, spatially overlapping subsystems of the social brain probably relate to interindividual differences in everyday social life.","2021","2022-07-15 09:48:09","2022-07-15 09:48:09","","65","","1","4","","","","","","","","","","English","","","/z-wcorg/","","http://worldcat.org","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

EI, and its component, can be improved with training, but currently the process is less flexible and very time-consuming. Machine learning (ML), on the other hand, can analyse huge amount of data to discover useful trends and patterns in shortest time possible. Despite the benefits, ML usage in EI training is scarce. In this paper, we studied 92 journal articles to discover the trend of the ML utilisation in the study of EI and its components. This survey aims to pave way for future studies that could lead to implementation of ML in EI training, and to rope in researchers in psychology and computer science to find possibilities of having a generic ML algorithm for every EIs components. Our findings show an increasing trend to apply ML on EI components, and Support Vector Machine and Neural Network are the two most popular ML algorithms used in those researches. We also found that social skill and empathy are the least exposed EI components to ML. Finally, we provide recommendations for future research direction of ML in EI domain, and EI in ML.","2022","2022-07-15 09:48:09","2022-07-15 09:48:09","","1485-1502","","7","41","","","","","","","","","","English","","","/z-wcorg/","","http://worldcat.org","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, we communicate through dialogue and exchange emotions and information from it. Emotions are essential characteristics of natural language. Conversational artificial intelligence is an integral part of all the technologies that allow computers to communicate like humans. For a computer to interact like a human being, it must understand the emotions inherent in the conversation and generate the appropriate responses. However, existing dialogue systems focus only on improving the quality of understanding natural language or generating natural language, excluding emotions. We propose a chatbot based on emotion, which is an essential element in conversation. EP-Bot (an Empathetic PolarisX-based chatbot) is an empathetic chatbot that can better understand a person's utterance by utilizing PolarisX, an auto growing knowledge graph. PolarisX extracts new relationship information and expands the knowledge graph automatically. It is helpful for computers to understand a person's common sense. The proposed EP-Bot extracts knowledge graph embedding using PolarisX and detects emotion and dialog act from the utterance. Then it generates the next utterance using the embeddings. EP-Bot could understand and create a conversation, including the person's common sense, emotion, and intention. We verify the novelty and accuracy of EP-Bot through the experiments.","2021","2022-07-15 14:59:22","2022-07-15 14:59:22","","2807-2817","","3","67","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 871 CORONADO CENTER DR, SUTE 200, HENDERSON, NV 89052 USA Publisher: TECH SCIENCE PRESS Type: Article","","","","conversational AI; emotion; Emotional chatbot; knowledge graph","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Over the last few years, there has been growing interest in empathic chatbots. In other disciplines aside from artificial intelligence, e.g., in medicine, there is growing interest in the study and simulation of human emotions. However, there is a fundamental issue that is not commonly addressed, and it is the design of protocols for quantitatively evaluating an empathic chatbot by utilizing the analysis of the conversation between the bot and an interlocutor. This study is motivated by the aforementioned scenarios and by the lack of methods for assessing the performance of an empathic bot; thus, a chatbot with the ability to recognize the emotions of its interlocutor is needed. The main novelty of this study is the protocol with which it is possible to analyze the conversations between a chatbot and an interlocutor, regardless of whether the latter is a person or another chatbot. For this purpose, we have designed a minimally viable prototype of an empathic chatbot, named LENNA, for evaluating the usefulness of the proposed protocol. The proposed approach uses Shannon entropy to measure the changes in the emotional state experienced by the chatbot during a conversation, applying sentiment analysis techniques to the analysis of the conversation. Once the simulation experiments were performed, the conversations were analyzed by applying multivariate statistical methods and Fourier analysis. We show the usefulness of the proposed methodology for evaluating the emotional state of LENNA during conversations, which could be useful in the evaluation of other empathic chatbots.","2021-12","2022-07-15 14:59:22","2022-07-15 14:59:22","","","","12","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND Publisher: MDPI Type: Article","","","","chatbot performance; empathic chatbot; entropy of emotional state changes; sentiment analysis; sentiment simulation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

First, humans do not consistently agree on what is or is not ethical. Second, contemporary AI and machine learning methods tend to be blunt instruments which either search for solutions within the bounds of predefined rules or mimic behavior. An ethical AI must be capable of inferring unspoken rules, interpreting nuance and context, possess and be able to infer intent, and explain not just its actions but its intent. Using enactivism, semiotics, perceptual symbol systems, and symbol emergence, we specify an agent that learns not just arbitrary relations between signs but their meaning in terms of the perceptual states of its sensorimotor system. Subsequently it can learn what is meant by a sentence and infer the intent of others in terms of its own experiences. It has malleable intent because the meaning of symbols changes as it learns, and its intent is represented symbolically as a goal. As such it may learn a concept of what is most likely to be considered ethical by the majority within a population of humans, which may then be used as a goal. The meaning of abstract symbols is expressed using perceptual symbols of raw, multimodal sensorimotor stimuli as the weakest (consistent with Ockham's Razor) necessary and sufficient concept, an intensional definition learned from an ostensive definition, from which the extensional definition or category of all ethical decisions may be obtained. Because these abstract symbols are the same for both situation and response, the same symbol is used when either performing or observing an action. This is akin to mirror neurons in the human brain. Mirror symbols may allow the agent to empathize, because its own experiences are associated with the symbol, which is also associated with the observation of another agent experiencing something that symbol represents.","2022-06","2022-07-15 14:59:22","2022-07-15 14:59:22","","292-300","","2","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA Publisher: IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC Type: Article","","","","Artificial intelligence; Artificial intelligence (AI) robotics; empathetic AI; enactivism; ethical AI; Ethics; Mirrors; Monitoring; Sociology; Statistics; symbol emergence; Vehicles","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Prior research in computational empathy has focused on designing empathic agents that use verbal and nonverbal behaviors to simulate empathy and attempt to elicit empathic responses from humans. The challenge of developing agents with the ability to automatically perceive elicited empathy in humans remains largely unexplored. Our paper presents the first approach to modeling user empathy elicited during interactions with a robotic agent. We collected a new dataset from the novel interaction context of participants listening to a robot storyteller (46 participants, 6.9 hours of video). After each storytelling interaction, participants answered a questionnaire that assessed their level of elicited empathy during the interaction with the robot. We conducted experiments with 8 classical machine learning models and 2 deep learning models (long short-term memory networks and temporal convolutional networks) to detect empathy by leveraging patterns in participants' visual behaviors while they were listening to the robot storyteller. Our highest-performing approach, based on XGBoost, achieved an accuracy of 69% and AUC of 72% when detecting empathy in videos. We contribute insights regarding modeling approaches and visual features for automated empathy detection. Our research informs and motivates future development of empathy perception models that can be leveraged by virtual and robotic agents during human-machine interactions.","2021","2022-07-15 14:59:22","2022-07-15 14:59:22","","","","","","","","","International Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction","","","","IEEE","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","English","","","","","","","ISSN: 2156-8103 Type: Proceedings Paper","","","","affective computing; computational empathy; human-robot interaction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study aims to explore consumers' trust and response to a text-based chatbot in e-commerce, involving the moderating effects of task complexity and chatbot identity disclosure. Design/methodology/approach A survey method with 299 useable responses was conducted in this research. This study adopted the ordinary least squares regression to test the hypotheses. Findings First, the consumers' perception of both the empathy and friendliness of the chatbot positively impacts their trust in it. Second, task complexity negatively moderates the relationship between friendliness and consumers' trust. Third, disclosure of the text-based chatbot negatively moderates the relationship between empathy and consumers' trust, while it positively moderates the relationship between friendliness and consumers' trust. Fourth, consumers' trust in the chatbot increases their reliance on the chatbot and decreases their resistance to the chatbot in future interactions. Research limitations/implications Adopting the stimulus-organism-response (SOR) framework, this study provides important insights on consumers' perception and response to the text-based chatbot. The findings of this research also make suggestions that can increase consumers' positive responses to text-based chatbots. Originality/value Extant studies have investigated the effects of automated bots' attributes on consumers' perceptions. However, the boundary conditions of these effects are largely ignored. This research is one of the first attempts to provide a deep understanding of consumers' responses to a chatbot.","2022-03-15","2022-07-15 14:59:22","2022-07-15 14:59:22","","496-517","","2, SI","32","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND Publisher: EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD Type: Article","","","","Consumers' response; Identity disclosure; Task complexity; Text-based chatbot; Trust","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Technological advancements are taking place at an incredible pace, largely due to AI or AI-backed systems. It is likely that there will be a massive explosion or “Cambrian explosion “ of AI in our everyday life, largely aided by increased funding and resources spent on research and development. AI has also significantly revolutionized the medical field. The concept of machine learning and deep learning in AI is the crux of its success. In surgical practice, AI has numerous applications in the diagnosis of disease, preoperative planning, intraoperative assistance, surgical training and assessment, and robotics. The potential automation of surgery is also a possibility in the next few decades. However, at present, augmentation rather than automation should be the priority. In spite of the allure of AI, it comes with its own price. A robot lacks the “sixth sense “ or intuition that is crucial in the practice of surgery and medicine. Empathy and human touch are also inimitable characteristics that cannot be replaced by an AI system. Other limitations include the financial burden and the feasibility of using such technology on a wide scale. Ethical and legal dilemmas such as those involving privacy laws are other issues that should be taken under consideration.

K.","Development of an Empathy-Centric Counseling Chatbot System Capable of Sentimental Dialogue Analysis","PROCESSES","","","10.3390/pr10050930","","College students encounter various types of stresses in school due to schoolwork, personal relationships, health issues, and future career concerns. Some students are susceptible to the strikes of failures and are inexperienced with or fearful of dealing with setbacks. When these negative emotions gradually accumulate without resolution, they can cause long-term negative effects on students' physical and mental health. Some potential health problems include depression, anxiety, and disorders such as eating disorders. Universities commonly offer counseling services; however, the demand often exceeds the counseling capacities due to limited numbers of counsellors/psychologists. Thus, students may not receive immediate counseling or treatments. If students are not treated, some repercussions may lead to severe abnormal behavior and even suicide. In this study, combining immersive virtual reality (VR) technique with psychological knowledge base, we developed a VR empathy-centric counseling chatbot (VRECC) that can complementarily support troubled students when counsellors cannot provide immediate support. Through multi-turn (verbal or text) conversations with the chatbot, the system can demonstrate empathy and give therapist-like responses to the users. During the study, more than 120 students were required to complete a questionnaire and 34 subjects with an above-median stress level were randomly drawn for the VRECC experiment. We observed decreasing average stress level and psychological sensitivity scores among subjects after the experiment. Although the system did not yield improvement in life-impact scores (e.g., behavioral and physical impacts), the significant outcomes of lowering stress level and psychological sensitivity have given us a very positive outlook for continuing to integrate VR, AI sentimental natural language process, and counseling chatbot for advanced VRECC research in helping students improve their psychological well-being and life quality at schools.","2022-05","2022-07-15 14:59:22","2022-07-15 14:59:22","","","","5","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND Publisher: MDPI Type: Article","","","","chatbot; counseling; school stress; sentiment understanding; virtual therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A two-stage structural equation modeling-artificial neural network approach was adopted to verify the proposed theoretical model. Findings Regarding the IQ (intelligence quotient) and EQ (emotional quotient) of AI chatbots, the multi-dimensional social support model helps explain consumers' interactant satisfaction with communication, which facilitates affective attachment and purchase intention. The results also show that chatbots should emphasize emotional and esteem social support more than informational support. Practical implications Brands should focus more on AI chatbots' emotional and empathetic responses than functional aspects when designing dialogue content for human-AI interactions. Well-designed AI chatbots can help marketers develop effective brand promotion strategies.

This article focuses on AI service recovery, abandoning the traditional “intelligence quotient” thinking and exploring the recovery effect of empathy response from the perspective of emotional intelligence. Using four experimental scenarios, the results indicate that, in service recovery, a high-empathy AI response can increase customers' continuous usage intention, and psychological distance and trust are sequential mediators in this process. Compared with mono-sensory stimulus interactions (text only), a high-empathy response that adopts multisensory stimulus interactions (text and voice) could strengthen the recovery effect of empathy responses. This paper extends the field of AI service research from a focus on time and phase to the continuing use of AI after service failure. It also moves beyond the traditional intelligence quotient improvement thinking and reveals the importance of using AI emotional intelligence to activate customer emotional response in AI service recovery. Finally, it provides a useful tool for resolving AI service failure problems autonomously in the service process, which is of great value to research and development and hospitality operators in the promotion and application of AI services.","2022-01","2022-07-15 14:59:23","2022-07-15 14:59:23","","","","","126","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND Publisher: PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD Type: Article","","","","Artificial intelligence (AI); Continuous usage intention; Emotional intelligence; Empathy; Service recovery","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although the replacement of human counsellors remains a speculative prospect, chatbots for `narrow AI' tasks (e.g., assessment and referral) are increasingly being used to augment clinical practice. Little research has addressed the possibilities for care that chatbots may generate in the future, particularly in the context of alcohol and other drug counselling. To explore these issues, we draw on the concept of technological `affordances' and identify the range of possibilities for care that emerging chatbot interventions may afford and foreclose depending on the contexts in which they are implemented. Our analysis is based on qualitative data from interviews with clients (n = 20) and focus group discussions with counsellors (n = 8) conducted as part of a larger study of an Australian online alcohol and other drug counselling service. Both clients and counsellors expressed a concern that chatbot interventions lacked a `human' element, which they valued in empathic care encounters. Most clients reported that they would share less information with a chatbot than a human counsellor, and they viewed this as constraining care. However, clients and counsellors suggested that the use of narrow AI might afford possibilities for performing discrete tasks, such as screening, triage or referral. In the context of what we refer to as `more-than-human' care, our findings reveal complex views about the types of affordances that chatbots may produce and foreclose in online care encounters. We conclude by discussing implications for the potential `addiction futures' and care trajectories that AI technologies offer, focussing on how they might inform alcohol and other drug policy, and the design of digital healthcare.","2021-08","2022-07-15 14:59:23","2022-07-15 14:59:23","","","","","94","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS Publisher: ELSEVIER Type: Article","","","","Addiction; Affordances; Artificial intelligence; Australia; Chatbots; Online care","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Multiple high-quality, Level I evidence, randomized, controlled investigations have recently shown the ability of hip arthroscopy to successfully treat femoroacetabular impingement syndrome and labral tears. Contemporary hip preservation practice strives to continually refine and improve the value of care provision. Multiple singlecenter and multicenter prospective registries continue to grow as part of both United Statesebased and international hip preservationespecific networks and collaborations. The ability to predict postoperative patient-reported outcomes preoperatively holds great promise with machine learning. Machine learning requires massive amounts of data, which can easily be generated from electronic medical records and both patient- and clinician-generated questionnaires. On top of text-based data, imaging (e.g., plain radiographs, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging) can be rapidly interpreted and used in both clinical practice and research. Formidable computational power is also required, using different advanced statistical methods and algorithms to generate models with the ability to predict individual patient outcomes. Efficient integration of machine learning into hip arthroscopy practice can reduce physicians' “busywork” of data collection and analysis. This can only improve the value of the patient experience, because surgeons have more time for shared decision making, with empathy, compassion, and humanity counterintuitively returning to medicine.","2021-05","2022-07-15 14:59:23","2022-07-15 14:59:23","","1498-1502","","5","37","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 1600 JOHN F KENNEDY BOULEVARD, STE 1800, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103-2899 USA Publisher: W B SAUNDERS CO-ELSEVIER INC Type: Editorial Material","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) provides opportunities for demand management of sexual and reproductive health services. Conversational agents/chatbots are increasingly common, although little is known about how this technology could aid services. This study aimed to identify barriers and facilitators for engagement with sexual health chatbots to advise service developers and related health professionals. Methods. In January-June 2020, we conducted face-to-face, semi-structured and online interviews to explore views on sexual health chatbots. Participants were asked to interact with a chatbot, offering advice on sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and relevant services. Participants were UK-based and recruited via social media. Data were recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically. Results. Forty participants (aged 18-50 years; 64% women, 77% heterosexual, 58% white) took part. Many thought chatbots could aid sex education, providing useful information about STIs and sign-posting to sexual health services in a convenient, anonymous and non-judgemental way. Some compared chatbots to health professionals or Internet search engines and perceived this technology as inferior, offering constrained content and interactivity, limiting disclosure of personal information, trust and perceived accuracy of chatbot responses. Conclusions. Despite mixed attitudes towards chatbots, this technology was seen as useful for anonymous sex education but less suitable for matters requiring empathy. Chatbots may increase access to clinical services but their effectiveness and safety need to be established. Future research should identify which chatbots designs and functions lead to optimal engagement with this innovation.","2021","2022-07-15 14:59:23","2022-07-15 14:59:23","","385-393","","5","18","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: UNIPARK, BLDG 1, LEVEL 1, 195 WELLINGTON RD, LOCKED BAG 10, CLAYTON, VIC 3168, AUSTRALIA Publisher: CSIRO PUBLISHING Type: Article","","","","AI; artificial intelligence; chatbot; e-health; education; health promotion; health services; risk assessment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Applications of machine learning in speech recognition (e.g., Alexa and Siri), image recognition, automated translation, autonomous driving, and medical diagnosis, have blurred the classical divide between human tasks and machine tasks. Although current Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) technologies outperform humans in many areas, tasks requiring common sense, contextual knowledge, creativity, adaptivity, and empathy are still best performed by humans. Hybrid Intelligence (HI) blends human intelligence and machine intelligence to combine the best of both worlds. Hence, current and future Business Process Management (BPM) initiatives need to consider HI and the changing boundaries between work done by people and work done by software robots. Consider, for example, the success of Robotic Process Automation (RPA), which demonstrates that gradually taking away repetitive tasks from workers is possible. In this viewpoint paper, we argue that process mining is a key technology to decide what to automate and what not. Moreover, using process mining, it is possible to systematically monitor and manage processes where work is distributed over human workers and software robots.","2021","2022-07-15 14:59:23","2022-07-15 14:59:23","","5-20","","2","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: SCIKA, CORRELHA, 00000, PORTUGAL Publisher: SCIKA Type: Article","","","","business process management; data science; Hybrid intelligence; machine learning; process science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For an individual to decide to disclose personal and potentially embarrassing information to a robot serving as a counselor, they must trust that the robot will safeguard their disclosures and be an empathetic listener. In this research 110 participants viewed four images and completed an online survey accessing their attitudes and decision on whether to self-disclose personal information to a robot counselor. Compared to the robot images, the results indicated a strong preference to disclose personal information to a human counselor regardless of the type of information.

This study aims to discover whether humans and a social chatbot communicate differently. Furthermore, we analyzed to what extent the chatbot's expressions affect the human users' expressions. A content analysis was conducted based on previously collected data from a longitudinal study, in which participants interacted seven times with chatbot Mitsuku over the course of three weeks. A randomly selected sample of 60 interactions was coded and results revealed that the participants self-disclosed more (intimately) and used more reciprocal self-disclosures, while the chatbot asked more questions, more reciprocal questions and more follow-up questions, expressed more similarity and humour. Moreover, the more questions the chatbot asked, the more the participants reciprocated these questions, and the more they self-disclosed. Our findings show that chatbots are programmed to gather information, by asking questions, to keep the conversation going, which elicits self-disclosure in human users.

A study on the effectiveness of motivational interviewing on engagement and therapeutic alliance","BMC PUBLIC HEALTH","","","10.1186/s12889-022-13115-x","","Background Cigarette smoking poses a major threat to public health. While cessation support provided by healthcare professionals is effective, its use remains low. Chatbots have the potential to serve as a useful addition. The objective of this study is to explore the possibility of using a motivational interviewing style chatbot to enhance engagement, therapeutic alliance, and perceived empathy in the context of smoking cessation. Methods A preregistered web-based experiment was conducted in which smokers (n = 153) were randomly assigned to either the motivational interviewing (MI)-style chatbot condition (n = 78) or the neutral chatbot condition (n = 75) and interacted with the chatbot in two sessions. In the assessment session, typical intake questions in smoking cessation interventions were administered by the chatbot, such as smoking history, nicotine dependence level, and intention to quit. In the feedback session, the chatbot provided personalized normative feedback and discussed with participants potential reasons to quit. Engagement with the chatbot, therapeutic alliance, and perceived empathy were the primary outcomes and were assessed after both sessions. Secondary outcomes were motivation to quit and perceived communication competence and were assessed after the two sessions. Results No significant effects of the experimental manipulation (MI-style or neutral chatbot) were found on engagement, therapeutic alliance, or perceived empathy. A significant increase in therapeutic alliance over two sessions emerged in both conditions, with participants reporting significantly increased motivation to quit. The chatbot was perceived as highly competent, and communication competence was positively associated with engagement, therapeutic alliance, and perceived empathy. Conclusion The results of this preregistered study suggest that talking with a chatbot about smoking cessation can help to motivate smokers to quit and that the effect of conversation has the potential to build up over time. We did not find support for an extra motivating effect of the MI-style chatbot, for which we discuss possible reasons. These findings highlight the promise of using chatbots to motivate smoking cessation. Implications for future research are discussed.","2022-04-12","2022-07-15 14:59:23","2022-07-15 14:59:23","","","","1","22","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND Publisher: BMC Type: Article","","","","Chatbot; Empathy; Engagement; Motivation to Quit; Motivational Interviewing; Smoking Cessation; Therapeutic Alliance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we introduce a preliminary study on human-robot mental comforting conversation, to make an android robot (ERICA) present an understanding of the user's situation by sharing similar emotional experiences to enhance the perception of empathy. Specifically, we create the emotional speech for ERICA by using CycleGAN-based emotional voice conversion model, in which the pitch and spectrogram of the speech are converted according to the user's mental state. Then, we design dialogue scenarios for the user to talk about his/her predicament with ERICA. In the dialogue, ERICA shares other people's similar predicaments and adopts a low-spirit voice to express empathy to the interlocutor's situation. At the end of the dialogue, ERICA tries to encourage with a positive voice. Subsequently, questionnaire-based evaluation experiments were conducted with the recorded conversation. In the questionnaire, we use the Big Five scale to evaluate ERICA's personality. In addition, the perception of emotion, empathy, and encouragement in the dialogue are evaluated.

It compared emotional support from chatbot versus human partners in terms of its process and conditional effects on stress/worry reduction. In an online experiment, participants discussed a personal stressor with a chatbot or a human partner who provided none, or either one or both of emotional support and reciprocal self-disclosure. The results showed that emotional support from a conversational partner was mediated through perceived supportiveness of the partner to reduce stress and worry among participants, and the link from emotional support to perceived supportiveness was stronger for a human than for a chatbot. A conversational partner's reciprocal self-disclosure enhanced the positive effect of emotional support on worry reduction. However, when emotional support was absent, a solely self-disclosing chatbot reduced even less stress than a chatbot not providing any response to participants' stress. Lay Summary In recent years, AI chatbots have increasingly been used to provide empathy and support to people who are experiencing stressful times. This study compared emotional support from a chatbot compared to that of a human who provided support. We were interested in examining which approach could best effectively reduce people's worry and stress. When either a person or a chatbot was able to engage with a stressed individual and tell that individual about their own experiences, they were able to build rapport. We found that this type of reciprocal self-disclosure was effective in calming the worry of the individual.

For a robot to apply a matching emotion in human-robot communication, the robot needs to be able to understand human feelings. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to improve the human impression of the robot using a robot that expresses human-like expressions by synchronizing with human biological information and changing the expressions in real time. We first measured and estimated human emotions using an emotion estimation method based on biological information (brain waves and heartbeats). The three-emotion estimation methods were proposed and evaluated in the preliminary experiment. Among the three-emotion estimation methods proposed, the one that yields the highest impression rating was chosen to be used in the second experiment which was based on the emotional value in each cycle method. Then, we developed a robot that shows expressions in two patterns: (1) synchronized emotion (same emotion as subject conveyed) and (2) inversed emotion with the human. The subjects evaluated the robot's expression from both patterns using semantic differential (SD) method while having their biological information measured based on the selected emotion estimation method from previous preliminary experiment. The evaluation by SD method and biological information results showed that when the human experienced the happiness emotion, and the robot synchronized and expressed the same emotion, this could increase the intimacy between human and robot. Here, it can be said that the impression created by the robot's expression can be improved using biological information.","2021-11","2022-07-15 14:59:23","2022-07-15 14:59:23","","379-389","","4","26","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article","","","","Biological information; Emotion analysis; Emotion estimation; Empathetic robot; Robot expression","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous studies have shown that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is effective in improving attention deficit symptoms. However, many patients are not receiving adequate treatment due to time, space, and cost constraints. Recently, in other mental illnesses, mobile-based chatbots delivering CBT and psychoeducation have been used for symptom mitigation and treatment. Objective: This study aimed to investigate the feasibility and usability of a short-term intervention, specifically a mobile-based interactive chatbot application, in alleviating attention deficit symptoms. Methods: This was a randomized, non-blind parallel-group pilot study conducted from September 2019 to March 2020. Forty-six individuals with attention deficit aged 19-60 were randomly allocated to the chatbot (n = 23) and information-only control groups (n = 23) for 4 weeks. The former group was instructed to use the chatbot application “Todaki,” while the latter group was provided with a book on managing attention deficit symptoms. Participants were administered questionnaires to assess their symptoms of attention deficit, depression, and anxiety and evaluated at baseline and 4 weeks after the intervention. The post-intervention survey assessed the chatbot's usability, acceptability, and side effects. Results: The average age of the participants was 25.1 years (standard deviation [SD] 7.5 years), and 56.5 % (26/ 46) participants were female. Intention-to-treat analysis (chatbot, n = 23; control, n = 23) revealed a significant reduction of attention deficit symptoms only in the chatbot group, which is represented by group-by-time interaction in Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale subscales of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-IV AttentionDeficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Hyperactive-Impulsive symptoms (F = 4.39; p = .04) and ADHD symptoms total (F = 6.74, p = .01). Further, the results of the paired t-test were significant only in the chatbot group. The average number of times the chatbots were used in 4 weeks was 20.32 (SD 12.89). The total average usage time was 1 h 15 min (SD 1 h 20 min). The degree of improvement in the ADHD symptoms total score was correlated with the number of times the psychoeducation program was used. According to the participants, the empathic/friendly character and unnatural flow of conversation were the best and worst features of the chatbot, respectively. Conclusions: This study identified the feasibility and usability of using the mobile-based chatbot to improve attention deficit and its associated psychiatric symptoms. Using this novel intervention to conduct CBT would provide a useful digital therapeutic tool that allows easy accessibility and self-guided management for people with attention deficit, which should be verified through the large scale randomized controlled trial.","2021-06","2022-07-15 14:59:23","2022-07-15 14:59:23","","","","","150","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: ELSEVIER HOUSE, BROOKVALE PLAZA, EAST PARK SHANNON, CO, CLARE, 00000, IRELAND Publisher: ELSEVIER IRELAND LTD Type: Article","","","","Attention deficit; Chatbot; Cognitive behavioral therapy attention-deficit; Conversational agent; hyperactivity disorder; Psychoeducation mobile app","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Situating the therapeutic, zoomorphic robot, Paro and the health care support robot, Care-O-Bot as part of empathetic arrangements draws attention to how the cultivation of empathy towards robots governs and regulates patient sociality.

In one condition, the robot gave advice and referred to something mentioned earlier in the conversation (i.e., to dialog history), in another condition, the robot gave advice and used empathic signals, and in the third condition, the robot gave advice only. Our results show that participants drank significantly more when the advice-giving robot also used the persuasive strategies of empathy and references to dialog history than when the robot only gave advice.

We present an online desktop virtual environment that follows the story of a male or female self-avatar from the first-person perspective, who either experiences a positive or negative workplace scenario. The negative scenario included many examples from the taxonomy of gender microaggressions. Participants who experienced negative workplace experiences with a female self-avatar had significantly decreased levels of implicit gender bias compared to those who had a male self-avatar. There was evidence of empathy and perspective taking in the negative condition for the female self-avatar. Experiences of a positive workplace scenario showed no significant decreases in implicit gender bias regardless of self-avatar gender. We discuss the implications of these findings and make recommendations for virtual environment technologies and scenarios with respect to the reduction of implicit biases.","","2022-07-15 14:59:24","2022-07-15 14:59:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA Publisher: TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC Type: Article; Early Access","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study seeks to examine the relationship between informativeness, empathy, accessibility, interactivity and chatbot user satisfaction. The research was based on an experiment and a survey conducted on a sample of 468 potential tourists who used a chatbot during their trip. Statistical tools such as exploratory factor analysis and the hierarchical regression method were used in the data analysis. The results suggest that informativeness, empathy and interactivity of destination chatbots are the attributes that influence and predict tourist satisfaction while accessibility does not. The main contribution of this study is the analysis of the attributes of STTs applied to destination chatbots, which also provides valuable information for both tourism chatbot developers and smart destination managers who wish to adopt this technology.","","2022-07-15 14:59:24","2022-07-15 14:59:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND Publisher: ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD Type: Article; Early Access","","","","accessibility; Chatbot; empathy; informativeness; interactivity; smart tourism technology; user satisfaction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, it is currently unknown how such experiences are modified by the sexual congruency between the human and the artificial agent. In two studies, heterosexual men (Experiment 1) and women (Experiment 2) embodied same-sex and opposite-sex avatars and were asked to evaluate the experience (e.g., pleasantness, erogeneity) of being touched on social or intimate areas of their virtual body by a male or female avatar. Electrocardiogram and galvanic skin response were also recorded. Moreover, participants' implicit and explicit gender biases were examined via a gender-potency implicit association test and the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory. When embodying a same-sex avatar, men and women rated caresses on intimate areas from an avatar of the opposite sex as more pleasant and erogenous. Conversely, body swap-that is, wearing an opposite-sex avatar-enhanced participants' perceptions of pleasantness and erogeneity for caresses on intimate areas from a same-sex toucher. This effect was stronger in men than in women. Furthermore, physiological correlates of enhanced processing of arousing stimuli predicted behavioural outcomes during the body swap illusion. Wearing an opposite-sex avatar affects one's own body representations and may have important implications on people's attitudes and implicit reactivity to touch-mediated interactions. Men seem more susceptible to this type of body swap illusion. Our paradigm may induce profound changes of cross-sex perspective-taking and provide novel tools for promoting empathy and comprehension of sex-related diversity.","2022-03","2022-07-15 14:59:24","2022-07-15 14:59:24","","461-474","","3","75","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND Publisher: SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD Type: Article","","","","Body ownership; body swap; embodiment; sex differences; social touch; virtual reality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, little is known about the mechanisms and boundary conditions that shape this effect. This study examines how the embodiment of both outgroup and ingroup VR avatars in different orders influences attitudes and perceived closeness toward a co-ethnic immigrant outgroup in Singapore. It also investigates the role of empathy and social identity orientation (SIO) in this relationship. An experiment with four avatar embodiment conditions (ingroup-then-outgroup, outgroup-then-ingroup, ingroup-only, and outgroup-only) was carried out with 171 participants from a public university in Singapore. Results showed that embodying an outgroup avatar alone, compared to embodying an ingroup avatar alone, significantly improves both attitudes and closeness toward an immigrant outgroup. The order of embodiment matters to an extent, suggesting the greater effectiveness of outgroup-first over ingroup-first embodiment in reducing bias. Empathy mediates the effect of all three outgroup embodiment conditions on improved attitudes and closeness toward immigrants. It was also found that the stronger one's SIO is, the more effective embodiment is in improving perceived closeness with the outgroup via empathy. Theoretical implications of these findings are discussed.","2021-10-15","2022-07-15 14:59:24","2022-07-15 14:59:24","","","","","12","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND Publisher: FRONTIERS MEDIA SA Type: Article","","","","anchoring; avatar embodiment; empathy; intergroup bias; social identity orientation; virtual reality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, medical education has not kept pace with the rapid advancements of AI. Despite several calls to action, the adoption of teaching on AI in undergraduate medical education (UME) has been limited. This scoping review aims to identify gaps and key themes in the peer-reviewed literature on AI training in UME. Method The scoping review was informed by Arksey and O'Malley's methodology. Seven electronic databases including MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched for articles discussing the inclusion of AI in UME between January 2000 and July 2020. A total of 4,299 articles were independently screened by 3 co-investigators and 22 full-text articles were included. Data were extracted using a standardized checklist. Themes were identified using iterative thematic analysis. Results The literature addressed: (1) a need for an AI curriculum in UME, (2) recommendations for AI curricular content including machine learning literacy and AI ethics, (3) suggestions for curriculum delivery, (4) an emphasis on cultivating “uniquely human skills” such as empathy in response to AI-driven changes, and (5) challenges with introducing an AI curriculum in UME. However, there was considerable heterogeneity and poor consensus across studies regarding AI curricular content and delivery. Conclusions Despite the large volume of literature, there is little consensus on what and how to teach AI in UME. Further research is needed to address these discrepancies and create a standardized framework of competencies that can facilitate greater adoption and implementation of a standardized AI curriculum in UME.","2021-11","2022-07-15 14:59:24","2022-07-15 14:59:24","","S62-S70","","11S, 60TH ANNUA","96","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA Publisher: LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS Type: Review","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Drawing on the assumption that chatbots are perceived as both technological tools and social actors, we aim to create a deep understanding of trust-building processes towards diagnostic chatbots compared to trust in medical professionals. We conducted a laboratory experiment in which participants interacted either with a diagnostic chatbot only or with an additional telemedicine professional before we interviewed them primarily on trust-building factors. We identified numerous software-related, user-related, and environment-related factors and derived a model of the initial trust-building process. The results support our assumption that it is equally essential to consider dimensions of physician and technology trust. One significant finding is that trust in a chatbot arises cognitively, while trusting a human agent is affect-based. We argue that the lack of affect-based trust inhibits the willingness to rely on diagnostic chatbots and facilitates the user's desire to keep control. Considering dimensions from doctor-patient trust, we found evidence that a chatbot's communication competencies are more important than empathic reactions as the latter may evoke incredibility feelings. To verify our findings, we applied the derived code system in a larger online survey.","2022-09","2022-07-15 14:59:24","2022-07-15 14:59:24","","","","","165","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND Publisher: ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD Type: Article","","","","Anthropomorphism; Chatbot; Conversational agent; mHealth; Telemedicine; Trust","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the potential of intergroup contact with an outgroup avatar in VR to increase empathy is less studied. Even though intergroup contact literature suggests that less threatening and more prosocial emotions are the key to understanding why intergroup contact is a powerful mean to decrease prejudice, few studies have investigated the effect of intergroup contact on empathy in VR. In this study, we developed a between-participants design to investigate how VR can be used to create a positive intergroup contact with a member of a stigmatized outgroup (ethnic minority) and present the results of the effect of intergroup contact in VR on empathy. Sixty four participants experienced either positive contact (i.e., equal intergroup status, collaborative) with a black (experimenter-controlled) avatar (experimental condition) or no intergroup contact (i.e., ingroup contact with a white avatar; control condition), with situational empathy (personal distress and empathic interest) being measured through a self-report questionnaire up to a week before and right after the VR contact experience.

Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) often exhibit low levels of social engagement with peers and adults, with clearly fewer instances of eye contact, initiation, joint attention, and empathy. Given the pivotal role of social engagement, procedures that naturally evoke higher rates of social engagement may be critical. Prior research suggests that cartoons and other animated characters are more appealing to children with ASD than traditional face-to-face interactions with adults. However, this assertion lacks consistent empirical support. In this study, five elementary age students with ASD participated in a series of interactions with adults and live animation avatars. An alternating treatments design was used to evaluate participants' social engagement comparing their interactions with avatars to those with humans. Data show all five participants were consistently more attentive to the avatar than to human interventionists. In addition, all participants and their parents indicated the procedures were socially valid (i.e., preferred, feasible, and effective).","","2022-07-15 14:59:24","2022-07-15 14:59:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 2455 ℡LER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA Publisher: SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC Type: Article; Early Access","","","","autism < exceptionalityceptionality; engagement; live animation avatars; single subject design < methodologies; small N; technology integration < technology perspectives","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Being well means being physically and mentally healthy. Additionally, feeling empowered is also a component of well-being. Recently, self-tracking has been proposed as means to achieve increased awareness, thus, giving the opportunity to identify and decrease undesired behaviours. However, inappropriately communicated self-tracking results might cause the opposite effect. To address this, a subtle self-tracking feedback by mirroring the self's state into an embodied artificial agent has been proposed. By eliciting empathy towards the artificial agent and fostering helping behaviours, users would help themselves as well. We searched the literature to find supporting or opposing evidence for the robot mirroring framework. The results showed an increasing interest in self-tracking technologies for well-being management. Current discussions disseminate what can be achieved with different levels of automation; the type and relevance of feedback; and the role that artificial agents, such as chatbots and robots, might play to support people's therapies. These findings support further development of the robot mirroring framework to improve medical, hedonic, and eudaemonic well-being.","2021","2022-07-15 14:59:24","2022-07-15 14:59:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","English","","","","","","","Type: Proceedings Paper","","","","Affective computing; chatbots; empathy; robotics; self-quantification; well-being","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such systems need to create an empathic interaction with the users; therefore, it os required to include an Emotion Recognition (ER) framework which has to run, in near real-time, together with several other intelligent services. Most of the low-cost commercial robots, however, although more accessible by users and healthcare facilities, have to balance costs and effectiveness, resulting in under-performing hardware in terms of memory and processing unit. This aspect makes the design of the systems challenging, requiring a trade-off between the accuracy and the complexity of the adopted models. This paper proposes a compact and robust service for Assistive Robotics, called Lightweight EMotion recognitiON (LEMON), which uses image processing, Computer Vision and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms to recognize facial expressions. Specifically, the proposed DL model is based on Residual Convolutional Neural Networks with the combination of Dilated and Standard Convolution Layers. The first remarkable result is the few numbers (i.e., 1.6 Million) of parameters characterizing our model. In addition, Dilated Convolutions expand receptive fields exponentially with preserving resolution, less computation and memory cost to recognize the distinction among facial expressions by capturing the displacement of the pixels. Finally, to reduce the dying ReLU problem and improve the stability of the model, we apply an Exponential Linear Unit (ELU) activation function in the initial layers of the model. We have performed training and evaluation (via one- and five-fold cross validation) of the model with five datasets available in the community and one mixed dataset created by taking samples from all of them. With respect to the other approaches, our model achieves comparable results with a significant reduction in terms of the number of parameters.","2022-05","2022-07-15 14:59:24","2022-07-15 14:59:24","","","","9","22","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND Publisher: MDPI Type: Article","","","","assistive robotics; computer vision; deep convolutional neural networks; emotion recognition; face recognition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This concept can be found in classic science fiction media such as Star Trek and Blade Runner and is also pondered on in more recent interactive media such as the video game Detroit: Become Human. In most depictions, emotions and empathy are presented as the key to being human. Misselhorn's new publication shows that these futuristic stories are becoming more and more relevant today. We must ask ourselves whether we are socially responsible enough to deal with the consequences of artificial empathy/awareness. If we create artificial life, we should be prepared to treat them accordingly as living beings with respect and no longer categorize them as objects.

Collectively, these have resulted in the modification of the physician's role as the gatekeeper for health care, increased shift-based care, and amplified interprofessional team-based care. Technological innovations present opportunities as well as challenges. Artificial intelligence, which has great potential, has already transformed some tasks, particularly those involving image interpretation. Ubiquitous access to information via the Internet by physicians and patients alike presents benefits as well as drawbacks: patients and providers have ready access to virtually all of human knowledge, but some websites are contaminated with misinformation and many people have difficulty differentiating between solid, evidence-based data and untruths. The role of the future physician will shift as complexity in health care increases and as artificial intelligence and other technologies advance. These technological advances demand new skills of physicians; memory and knowledge accumulation will diminish in importance while information management skills will become more important. In parallel, medical educators must enhance their teaching and assessment of critical human skills (e.g., clear communication, empathy) in the delivery of patient care. The authors emphasize the enduring role of critical human skills in safe and effective patient care even as medical practice is increasingly guided by artificial intelligence and related technology, and they suggest new and longitudinal ways of assessing essential noncognitive skills to meet the demands of the future. The authors envision practical and achievable benefits accruing to patients and providers if practitioners leverage technological advancements to facilitate the development of their critical human skills.","2021-01","2022-07-15 14:59:24","2022-07-15 14:59:24","","37-43","","1","96","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA Publisher: LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Can we actually use social terms and explanations in relation to these inanimate machines? In this article, I analyse the range of uses of the term empathy in the field of HRI studies and social robotics, and consider the substantial, functional and relational positions on this issue. I focus on the relational (cooperational) perspective presented by Luisa Damiano and Paul Dumouchel, who interpret emotions (together with empathy) as being the result of affective coordination.

Logstrup","AI & SOCIETY","","0951-5666","10.1007/s00146-021-01211-2","","Empirical research on human-robot interaction (HRI) has demonstrated how humans tend to react to social robots with empathic responses and moral behavior. How should we ethically evaluate such responses to robots? Are people wrong to treat non-sentient artefacts as moral patients since this rests on anthropomorphism and `over-identification' (Bryson and Kime, Proc Twenty-Second Int Jt Conf Artif Intell Barc Catalonia Spain 16-22:1641-1646, 2011)-or correct since spontaneous moral intuition and behavior toward nonhumans is indicative for moral patienthood, such that social robots become our `Others' (Gunkel, Robot rights, MIT Press, London, 2018; Coeckelbergh, Kairos J Philos Sci 20:141-158, 2018)?. In this research paper, I weave extant HRI studies that demonstrate empathic responses toward robots with the recent debate on moral status for robots, on which the ethical evaluation of moral behavior toward them is dependent. Patienthood for robots has standardly been thought to obtain on some intrinsic ground, such as being sentient, conscious, or having interest. But since these attempts neglect moral experience and are curbed by epistemic difficulties, I take inspiration from Coeckelbergh and Gunkel's `relational approach' to explore an alternative way of accounting for robot patienthood based on extrinsic premises. Based on the ethics of Danish theologian K. E. Logstrup (1905-1981) I argue that empathic responses can be interpreted as sovereign expressions of life and that these expressions benefit human subjects-even if they emerge from social interaction afforded by robots we have anthropomorphized. I ultimately develop an argument in defense of treating robots as moral patients.","2022-06","2022-07-15 14:59:24","2022-07-15 14:59:24","","535-548","","2","37","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article","","","","Empathy; Ethics; K.

Current systems do not need to be conscious to recognize patterns and classify them. However, for AI to advance to the next level, it needs to develop capabilities such as metathinking, creativity, and empathy. We contend that such a paradigm shift is possible through a fundamental change in the state of artificial intelligence toward consciousness, similar to what took place for humans through the process of natural selection and evolution. To that end, we propose that consciousness in AI is an emergent phenomenon that primordially appears when two machines cocreate their own language through which they can recall and communicate their internal state of time-varying symbol manipulation. Because, in our view, consciousness arises from the communication of inner states, it leads to empathy. We then provide a link between the empathic quality of machines and better service outcomes associated with empathic human agents that can also lead to accountability in AI services.","","2022-07-15 14:59:24","2022-07-15 14:59:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 2455 ℡LER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA Publisher: SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC Type: Article; Early Access","","","","accountable AI; artificial intelligence; conscious AI; consciousness; empathic AI","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For this reason, it is hard to demonstrate empathy in communication with humans. If frequency modification is applied to neutral emotions, or if a different emotional frequency is added to them, it is possible to develop artificial intelligence with emotions. This study proposes the emotion conversion using the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based voice frequency synthesis. The proposed method extracts a frequency from speech data of twenty-four actors and actresses. In other words, it extracts voice features of their different emotions, preserves linguistic features, and converts emotions only. After that, it generates a frequency in variational auto-encoding Wasserstein generative adversarial network (VAW-GAN) in order to make prosody and preserve linguistic information. That makes it possible to learn speech features in parallel. Finally, it corrects a frequency by employing Amplitude Scaling. With the use of the spectral conversion of logarithmic scale, it is converted into a frequency in consideration of human hearing features. Accordingly, the proposed technique provides the emotion conversion of speeches in order to express emotions in line with artificially generated voices or speeches.","2022-02-28","2022-07-15 14:59:25","2022-07-15 14:59:25","","713-725","","2","16","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: KOR SCI & TECHNOL CTR, 409 ON 4TH FLR, MAIN BLDG, 635-4 YEOKSAM 1-DONG, GANGNAM-GU, SEOUL 00000, SOUTH KOREA Publisher: KSII-KOR SOC INTERNET INFORMATION Type: Article","","","","Emotion Transformation; Generative Adversarial Network; Voice Analysis; Voice Frequency Synthesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It has been argued that empathy has a strong effect on behavior inducement. In human-human interaction, it has been verified that the influence of a nonverbal cue on empathy outweighs that of a verbal cue when those are used in a combined way. The objectives of this study are to explore if such outweighing effect of nonverbal cues is maintained in human-robot interaction (HRI) and to investigate the mechanism of communication cues' effects by analyzing the mediation structure with the following mediator variables: perceived emotion, perceived intentionality, perceived malfunction, and empathy inducement. To this end, we conducted 2 (verbal type: positive verbal cue vs. negative verbal cue) x 2 (nonverbal type: positive nonverbal cue vs. negative nonverbal cue) within-participant experiment (N = 48). The experiment created a situation in which the social robot was harshly criticized during a conversation. The analysis of experiment results showed the outweighing effect of a nonverbal cue was maintained. When a nonverbal cue conveyed a negative, situation-accordant emotion, it had a decisive effect on perceived emotion, empathy, and behavior inducement. In contrast, a verbal cue induced participants' empathy and behavior when it conveyed a positive, situation-discordant emotion. This inconsistency between verbal cue and nonverbal cue made the combination of positive verbal cue and negative nonverbal cue have the strongest effect. It implies that participants had different expectations for each of the two communication cues, just as they did in social interactions with human beings. It implies that participants might have applied normative expectations for social interaction with human beings to the social robot.","2021","2022-07-15 14:59:25","2022-07-15 14:59:25","","854-861","","","","","","","IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems","","","","IEEE","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: IEEE; RSJ ISSN: 2153-0858 Type: Proceedings Paper","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We analyzed 105+ million tweets collected between March 1 and May 15, 2020, and Weibo messages compiled between January 20 and May 15, 2020, covering six languages (English, Spanish, Arabic, French, Italian, and Chinese) and represented an estimated 2.4 billion citizens worldwide. To examine fine-grained emotions during a pandemic, we built machine learning classification models based on deep learning language models to identify emotions in social media conversations about COVID-19, including positive expressions (optimistic, thankful, and empathetic), negative expressions (pessimistic, anxious, sad, annoyed, and denial), and a complicated expression, joking, which has not been explored before. Our analysis indicates a rapid increase and a slow decline in the volume of social media conversations regarding the pandemic in all six languages. The upsurge was triggered by a combination of economic collapse and confinement measures across the regions to which all the six languages belonged except for Chinese, where only the latter drove conversations. Tweets in all analyzed languages conveyed remarkably similar emotional states as the epidemic was elevated to pandemic status, including feelings dominated by a mixture of joking with anxious/pessimistic/annoyed as the volume of conversation surged and shifted to a general increase in positive states (optimistic, thankful, and empathetic), the strongest being expressed in Arabic tweets, as the pandemic came under control.","2021-05-17","2022-07-15 14:59:25","2022-07-15 14:59:25","","","","1","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND Publisher: SPRINGERNATURE Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Given that chatbot services infused with domain knowledge are of great interest to not only global businesses but also academics, chatbots have in recent years become a popular research topic in the field of natural language processing. We therefore aim at improving current chatbots with the addition of natural emotions. In contrast to previous work, we intend to distinguish fine-grained emotion differences between words in order to better understand emotion expressions in sentences. Our approach infuses fine-grained emotion content into the response generation process to make the dialog more emotionally resonant. The experimental results demonstrate that this method can classify emotions more effectively. In addition, the proposed hybrid model, which consists of recurrent and convolutional neural networks with additional emotion specific valence-arousal features, can correctly identify five emotions with a 67.89% overall F1-score. We further evaluate the subjective quality of the responses and discover that the infusion of finegrained emotion information substantially improves the quality and fluency of automatically generated empathetic conversation. We conclude that the proposed model can greatly improve the efficiency and usability of a conversational chatbot system. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

However, the perceptions and needs of such systems remain elusive, hindering efforts to promote AI adoption in health care. Objective: This study aims to provide an overview of the perceptions and needs of AI to increase its adoption in health care. Methods: A systematic scoping review was conducted according to the 5-stage framework by Arksey and O'Malley. Articles that described the perceptions and needs of AI in health care were searched across nine databases: ACM Library, CINAHL, Cochrane Central, Embase, IEEE Xplore, PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science for studies that were published from inception until June 21, 2021. Articles that were not specific to AI, not research studies, and not written in English were omitted. Results: Of the 3666 articles retrieved, 26 (0.71%) were eligible and included in this review. The mean age of the participants ranged from 30 to 72.6 years, the proportion of men ranged from 0% to 73.4%, and the sample sizes for primary studies ranged from 11 to 2780. The perceptions and needs of various populations in the use of AI were identified for general, primary, and community health care; chronic diseases self-management and self-diagnosis; mental health; and diagnostic procedures. The use of AI was perceived to be positive because of its availability, ease of use, and potential to improve efficiency and reduce the cost of health care service delivery. However, concerns were raised regarding the lack of trust in data privacy, patient safety, technological maturity, and the possibility of full automation. Suggestions for improving the adoption of AI in health care were highlighted: enhancing personalization and customizability; enhancing empathy and personification of AI-enabled chatbots and avatars; enhancing user experience, design, and interconnectedness with other devices; and educating the public on AI capabilities. Several corresponding mitigation strategies were also identified in this study. Conclusions: The perceptions and needs of AI in its use in health care are crucial in improving its adoption by various stakeholders. Future studies and implementations should consider the points highlighted in this study to enhance the acceptability and adoption of AI in health care. This would facilitate an increase in the effectiveness and efficiency of health care service delivery to improve patient outcomes and satisfaction.","2022-01-14","2022-07-15 14:59:25","2022-07-15 14:59:25","","","","1","24","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 130 QUEENS QUAY E, STE 1102, TORONTO, ON M5A 0P6, CANADA Publisher: JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC Type: Review","","","","artificial intelligence; health care; needs; perceptions; review; scoping; service delivery","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: Using transcripts from 353 primary care office visits with 350 patients and 84 physicians (Cook, 2002 [1], Tai-Seale et al., 2015 [2]), we developed two machine learning models (a recurrent neural network with a hierarchical structure and a logistic regression classifier) to recognize the emotional valence (positive, negative, neutral) (Posner et al., 2005 [3]) of each utterance. We examined the agreement of human-generated ratings of emotional valence with machine learning model ratings of emotion. Results: The agreement of emotion ratings from the recurrent neural network model with human ratings was comparable to that of human-human inter-rater agreement. The weighted-average of the correlation coefficients for the recurrent neural network model with human raters was 0.60, and the human rater agreement was also 0.60. Conclusions: The recurrent neural network model predicted the emotional valence of patients and physicians in primary care visits with similar reliability as human raters. Practice implications: As the first machine learning-based evaluation of emotion recognition in primary care visit conversations, our work provides valuable baselines for future applications that might help monitor patient emotional signals, supporting physicians in empathic communication, or examining the role of emotion in patient-centered care.

However, social media data is unstructured and enormous in volume. Moreover, no empirical research on the use of social media data and perceived hospital quality of care based on patient online reviews has been performed in Malaysia. The purpose of this study was to investigate the determinants of positive sentiment expressed in hospital Facebook reviews in Malaysia, as well as the association between hospital accreditation and sentiments expressed in Facebook reviews. From 2017 to 2019, we retrieved comments from 48 official public hospitals' Facebook pages. We used machine learning to build a sentiment analyzer and service quality (SERVQUAL) classifier that automatically classifies the sentiment and SERVQUAL dimensions. We utilized logistic regression analysis to determine our goals. We evaluated a total of 1852 reviews and our machine learning sentiment analyzer detected 72.1% of positive reviews and 27.9% of negative reviews. We classified 240 reviews as tangible, 1257 reviews as trustworthy, 125 reviews as responsive, 356 reviews as assurance, and 1174 reviews as empathy using our machine learning SERVQUAL classifier. After adjusting for hospital characteristics, all SERVQUAL dimensions except Tangible were associated with positive sentiment. However, no significant relationship between hospital accreditation and online sentiment was discovered. Facebook reviews powered by machine learning algorithms provide valuable, real-time data that may be missed by traditional hospital quality assessments. Additionally, online patient reviews offer a hitherto untapped indication of quality that may benefit all healthcare stakeholders. Our results confirm prior studies and support the use of Facebook reviews as an adjunct method for assessing the quality of hospital services in Malaysia.","2021-09","2022-07-15 14:59:25","2022-07-15 14:59:25","","","","18","18","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND Publisher: MDPI Type: Article","","","","accreditation; Facebook; machine learning; Malaysia; patient online review; sentiment; service quality; SERVQUAL; social media","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One element of empathy is the notion of perspective-taking. This paper explores the extent to which four previously used perspective-taking game design techniques, when applied in a different context, have a similar or different impact. The four techniques are point of view, avatar, similarities, and switching avatars. These techniques are known to have an impact on how a player identifies with their in-game representation and how it may have an impact on their perspective-taking. The new context into which they are applied is a game designed to develop empathic feelings towards immigrant workers (a person who goes into another country and works there) in different office workplace engagement settings. Twenty participants played the game. Before playing the game, each participant completed a questionnaire about their perceived level of empathy and their personal attitudes towards immigrant workers. Instrumentation was used to record each player's perspective-taking choices during the game. Each player was interviewed after the game about their choices and the extent to which they felt that their perceived levels of empathy had changed. A total of 45% of the players thought that the techniques enhanced their ability to perspective-take, 25% were uncertain and 30% thought the techniques did not impact their ability to perspective-take. Switching avatars was voted upon the most as the better technique. Authenticity and perceptive reasoning were the most common referenced traits ascribed to the techniques used. Eventually the perspective-taking game techniques provided support in a broader sense showing that they are tools that can be used to help facilitate, contribute, and support some degree of perspective-taking, knowing that each technique has its own merits and should be used with such consideration. This paper discusses the implications of these findings.","2021","2022-07-15 14:59:25","2022-07-15 14:59:25","","819-826","","","","","","","Proceedings of the European Conference on Games-Based Learning","","","","ACAD CONFERENCES LTD","CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND","English","","","","","","","ISSN: 2049-0992 Type: Proceedings Paper","","","","avatar; empathy game design; Identity; immigrant workers; perspective-taking; serious games","","Fotaris, P","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Perceptions of AI are less well-known, notably amongst children and young people (CYP). This workshop investigates attitudes towards AI and its future applications in medicine and healthcare at a specialised paediatric hospital using practical design scenarios. Method Twenty-one members of a Young Persons Advisory Group for research contributed to an engagement workshop to ascertain potential opportunities, apprehensions, and priorities. Results When presented as a selection of practical design scenarios, we found that CYP were more open to some applications of AI in healthcare than others. Human-centeredness, governance and trust emerged as early themes, with empathy and safety considered as important when introducing AI to healthcare. Educational workshops with practical examples using AI to help, but not replace humans were suggested to address issues, build trust, and effectively communicate about AI. Conclusion Whilst policy guidelines acknowledge the need to include children and young people to develop AI, this requires an enabling environment for human-centred AI involving children and young people with lived experiences of healthcare. Future research should focus on building consensus on enablers for an intelligent healthcare system designed for the next generation, which fundamentally, allows co-creation. Impact Children and young people (CYP) want to be included to share their insights about the development of research on the potential role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in medicine and healthcare and are more open to some applications of AI than others. Whilst it is acknowledged that a research gap on involving and engaging CYP in developing AI policies exists, there is little in the way of pragmatic and practical guidance for healthcare staff on this topic. This requires research on enabling environments for ongoing digital cooperation to identify and prioritise unmet needs in the application and development of AI.","","2022-07-15 14:59:25","2022-07-15 14:59:25","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND Publisher: SPRINGERNATURE Type: Article; Early Access","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The present study aimed to explore the predictors of compassion fatigue among a high-risk population of psychological hotline counselors. Seven hundred and twelve psychological hotline counselors were recruited from the Mental Health Service Platform at Central China Normal University, Ministry of Education, then were asked to complete the questionnaires measuring compassion fatigue, trait empathy, social support, trait mindfulness, counselor's self-efficacy, humor, life meaning, and post-traumatic growth. A chi-square test was utilized to filter for the top-20 predictive variables. Machine learning techniques, including logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, k-nearest neighbor, support vector machine, and naive Bayes were employed to predict compassion fatigue. The results showed that the most important predictors of compassion fatigue were meaning in life, counselors' self-efficacy, mindfulness, and empathy. Except for the decision tree, the rest machine learning techniques obtained good performance. Naive Bayes presented the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.803. Random forest achieved the least classification error of 23.64, followed by Naive Bayes with a classification error of 23.85. These findings support the potential application of machine learning techniques in the prediction of compassion fatigue.","","2022-07-15 14:59:25","2022-07-15 14:59:25","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article; Early Access","","","","Compassion fatigue; COVID-19; Hotline psychological counselor; Machine learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Deciding how much weight users have in emerging motion commands is necessary to assess their condition and needs, usually from on-board sensors. Unfortunately, some relevant parameters for safe and comfortable gait assistance (i.e. balance or stress) are extremely difficult to measure using only on-board sensors. Therefore, wearable devices that offer real-time physiological data acquisition are meant to be a valuable source of relevant information of users' psychological states such stress.

Algorithmic governance clearly promises more accurate, data-driven decisions. Moreover, due to their mathematical properties, algorithms might well prove to be more faithful agents of democratic institutions. Yet even if an automated state were smarter and more accountable, it might risk being less empathic.

The experimental results show that the android offers a more valuable user experience by giving the impression of being more empathetic and engaging in the conversation due to its nonverbal information, such as facial expressions and body gestures.","2021","2022-07-15 14:59:25","2022-07-15 14:59:25","","257-260","","","","","","","","","","","ASSOC COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS","PO BOX 6090, SOMERSET, NJ 08875 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: Assoc Computat Linguist; Apple; DataBaker Beijing Technology; Google; Rasa Technologies; Furhat Robot; Toshiba Res Europe; Chinese & Oriental Languages Informat Proc Soc; Natl Univ Singapore; Teochew Doctorate Soc Singapore; COLiPS; Special Interest Grp Discourse & Dialogue Type: Proceedings Paper","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the unstructured nature of POR data derived from social media creates a number of challenges. The objectives of this research were to identify service quality (SERVQUAL) dimensions automatically from hospital Facebook reviews using a machine learning classifier, and to examine their associations with patient dissatisfaction. From January 2017 to December 2019, empirical research was conducted in which POR were gathered from the official Facebook page of Malaysian public hospitals. To find SERVQUAL dimensions in POR, a machine learning topic classification utilising supervised learning was developed, and this study's objective was established using logistic regression analysis. It was discovered that 73.5% of patients were satisfied with the public hospital service, whereas 26.5% were dissatisfied. SERVQUAL dimensions identified were 13.2% reviews of tangible, 68.9% of reliability, 6.8% of responsiveness, 19.5% of assurance, and 64.3% of empathy. After controlling for hospital variables, all SERVQUAL dimensions except tangible and assurance were shown to be significantly related with patient dissatisfaction (reliability, p < 0.001; responsiveness, p = 0.016; and empathy, p < 0.001). Rural hospitals had a higher probability of patient dissatisfaction (p < 0.001). Therefore, POR, assisted by machine learning technologies, provided a pragmatic and feasible way for capturing patient perceptions of care quality and supplementing conventional patient satisfaction surveys. The findings offer critical information that will assist healthcare authorities in capitalising on POR by monitoring and evaluating the quality of services in real time.</p>","2021-10","2022-07-15 14:59:25","2022-07-15 14:59:25","","","","10","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND Publisher: MDPI Type: Article","","","","Facebook; machine learning; Malaysia; patient online review; patient satisfaction; service quality; SERVQUAL","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, designing and developing an effective open-domain chatbot is challenging. It is unclear what qualities of such chatbots most correspond to users' expectations. Even though existing work has considered a wide range of aspects, some key components are still missing. More importantly, the consistency and validity of the combined criteria have not been tested. In this paper, we describe a large-scale survey using a consolidated model to elicit users' preferences, expectations, and concerns. We apply structural equation modeling methods to further validate the data collected from the user survey. The outcome supports the consistency, validity, and reliability of the model, which we call PEACE (Politeness, Entertainment, Attentive Curiosity, and Empathy). PEACE, therefore, defines the key determinants most predictive of user acceptance. This has allowed us to develop a set of implications useful for the development of compelling open-domain chatbots.","2021","2022-07-15 14:59:26","2022-07-15 14:59:26","","520-530","","","","","","","","","","","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: Texas A & M Univ; Google; Microsoft; MDPI, Multimodal Technologies & Interact; AAAS, Sci Robot Type: Proceedings Paper","","","","adoption; chatbots; questionnaire; SEM; user study","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The music in videos has a sensitive influence on human emotions, perception, and imaginations, which can make people feel relaxed or sad, and so on. Therefore, it is particularly important for people who make advertising videos to understand the relationship between the physical elements of music and empathy characteristics. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the music features in an advertising video and extract the music features that make people empathize. This paper combines both methods of the power spectrum of MFCC and image RGB analysis to find the audio feature vector. In spectral analysis, the eigenvectors obtained in the analysis process range from blue (low range) to green (medium range) to red (high range). The machine learning random forest classifier is used to classify the data obtained by machine learning, and the trained model is used to monitor the development of an advertisement empathy system in real time. The result is that the optimal model is obtained with the training accuracy result of 99.173% and a test accuracy of 86.171%, which can be deemed as correct by comparing the three models of audio feature value analysis. The contribution of this study can be summarized as follows: (1) the low-frequency and high-amplitude audio in the video is more likely to resonate than the high-frequency and high-amplitude audio; (2) it is found that frequency and audio amplitude are important attributes for describing waveforms by observing the characteristics of the machine learning classifier; (3) a new audio extraction method is proposed to induce human empathy. That is, the feature value extracted by the method of spectrogram image features of audio has the most ability to arouse human empathy.","2021-11","2022-07-15 14:59:26","2022-07-15 14:59:26","","","","21","21","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND Publisher: MDPI Type: Article","","","","audio processing; empathy evaluation; machine learning; MFCC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The theoretical basis of the study was the SERVQUAL theory, which is widely used in measuring and managing service quality in various industries. The results showed that the assurance and reliability of chatbots positively impact customer satisfaction for both groups. However, empathy and interactivity positively affect customer satisfaction only for chatbots with emotion words. Responsiveness did not have an impact on customer satisfaction for both groups.

Drawing on case study research in eight German organizations that have either implemented AI or are in the process of developing AI systems, we identify three pervasive changes that knowledge workers perceive: a shift from manual labor and repetitive tasks to tasks that involve reasoning and empathy, an emergence of new tasks and roles, and an emergence of new skill requirements. In addition, we identify three factors that are conducive to the development of AI systems in the context of knowledge work: leadership support, participative change management, and effective integration of domain knowledge.

We detail the development of a novel design framework for transparency integration in Decision Support Systems. We selected the design thinking approach as the baseline for our framework as this focuses on developing empathy with users and rapid design iteration. We adapted this framework by introducing the concept of empathy for both human and machine agents. In this situation, “empathy” is providing a deep understanding of the model, its purpose and the underlying data for AI. We developed a structured problem definition focused on understanding the relationships between constructs and established solution themes to guide the designer.

Drawing on Jane Bennett's notion of thing-power, the article focuses on the spaceship Aniara's artificial intelligence, Mima. Both in Martinson's text and the film adaptation, Mima is depicted as a sentient machine that does not show empathy with suffering humans but rather with the suffering of nature, epitomized in crying stones.

However, as the opportunities offered by technology and artificial intelligence increase, digital assistants can also provide emotional support, which refers to empathetic, reassuring expressions for customers who have failed or succeeded in fulfilling a task. We show across four experiments that emotional support offered by a digital assistant increases customer satisfaction (Study 1 and 2) and persistence (Study 3 and 4) in using technology-mediated services. The increase in satisfaction occurs via the perceived warmth of the digital assistant, and the increase in persistence via the serial mediation of perceived warmth and satisfaction. Further, the results of a moderated serial mediation show that the effect on persistence only occurs when a digital (but not when a human) assistant provides emotional support in technology-mediated services. Finally, the effect of emotional support on persistence occurs independently of the digital assistant's embodiment. Practitioners learn how to imbue technology-mediated services with a human touch, inducing favorable customer outcomes. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The selected narratives treat with contemporary issues such as migration, racial- discrimination and its perpetuation from history to present, and prejudice towards LGBTQIA individuals.

We used the input modalities such as relative spatial information, facial expressions, body gestures and speech information as perception input that triggers the robot's empathic response. First, we bootstrap the training through a pre-learning mechanism in which training is conducted by users who know the robotic system. This phase provides simulation-based training using a simple graphical user interface to simulate the input, rewards and correction feedback. In the second phase, we developed an online learning scheme for naive users to personalize their robot further, building on top of the bootstrapped model. here, we developed a natural user interface that enables natural human-robot interaction via the suite of sensors that allows the users to provide evaluative feedback during the interaction with the robot. We evaluated the system and our results show that bootstrapping is an efficient tool to hasten the robot's learning while online learning provided some form of personalization in the real environment with naive users.","2021","2022-07-15 14:59:26","2022-07-15 14:59:26","","989-996","","","","","","","IEEE RO-MAN","","","","IEEE","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: IEEE ISSN: 1944-9445 Type: Proceedings Paper","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the service literature, the service is usually delivered by a human to a human customer and the quality of the service is often evaluated using the SERVQUAL dimensions. An extensive review of the literature shows there is a lack of an empirical model to assess the perceived service quality provided by a social robot. Furthermore, the social robot literature highlights key differences between human service and social robots. For example, scholars have highlighted the importance of entertainment value and engagement in the adoption of social robots in the service industry. However, it is unclear whether the SERVQUAL dimensions are appropriate to measure social robot's service quality. The paper proposes the SERVBOT model to assess a social robot's service quality. It identifies, reliability, responsiveness, assurance, empathy, and entertainment as the five dimensions of SERVBOT. Further, the research will investigate how these five factors influence emotional engagement and future intentions to use the social robot in a concierge service setting. The model was tested using student sampling, and a total of 94 responses were collected for the study. The findings indicate empathy and entertainment value as key predictors of emotional engagement. Further, emotional engagement is a strong predictor of future intention to use a social robot in a service setting. This study is the first to propose the SERVBOT model to measure social robot's service quality. The model provides a theoretical underpinning on the key service quality dimensions of a social robot and gives scholars and managers a method to track the service quality of a social robot. The study also extends on the literature by exploring the key factors that influence the use of social robots (i.e., emotional engagement).","2021-12-13","2022-07-15 14:59:26","2022-07-15 14:59:26","","","","","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND Publisher: FRONTIERS MEDIA SA Type: Article","","","","concierge; human-robot interaction; retail; service quality; SERVQUAL","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There has been a lot of recent work and applications showing the promise and efficiency of AI in clinical medicine, both at the research and treatment levels. Many of the obstacles discussed in the literature are technical in character, regarding how to improve and optimize current practices in clinical medicine and also how to develop better data bases for optimal parameter adjustments and predictive algorithms. This paper argues that there are also in principle obstacles to the application of AI in clinical medicine and care where empathy is important, and that these problems cannot be solved with any of the technical and theoretical approaches that shape the current application of AI in specific areas of clinical medicine in which care for patients is fundamental. This is important, because it generates specific risks that may be overlooked otherwise, and it justifies the necessity of human monitoring and emotional intervention in clinical medicine. Consequently, difficult issues concerning moral and legal responsibility may ensue if these in principle problems are ignored.","","2022-07-15 14:59:27","2022-07-15 14:59:27","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article; Early Access","","","","Attention; Care; Clinical medicine; Consciousness; Empathy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

New product development is a creative activity that requires product designers to imagine how people will live in the near future. So, we speculated that a familiar scenario that matches designers' background (including knowledge, expertise, and experience) can spark their entrepreneurial imaginativeness by empathic simulation and conducted an experiment to research the impact of scenarios on the performance of entrepreneurial imaginativeness. Results of this study confirmed that a familiar scenario did indeed inspire entrepreneurial imaginativeness more than an unfamiliar scenario, especially for high entrepreneurial imaginativeness. This study provided a new respective for understanding the relationship between the empathy process and entrepreneurial opportunity recognition and evaluation processes and had practical implications for entrepreneurial practice, especially those that make human life better based on new digital technologies. Finally, we gave some suggestions on enhancing individuals' entrepreneurial imaginativeness through different familiar scenarios and improving the team performance on creative tasks.","2022-03-31","2022-07-15 14:59:27","2022-07-15 14:59:27","","","","","13","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND Publisher: FRONTIERS MEDIA SA Type: Article","","","","creativity; entrepreneurial imaginativeness; imagination; new venture ideas; scenario","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The qualitative data included heart rate variability (HRV), video-audio recordings, and field notes. HRV, Haar cascade classifier (HCC), and Empath API(C) were evaluated during conversations between the patient and robot. Two expert nurses and one psychiatrist evaluated facial expressions. The research hypothesis questioned whether HRV, HCC, and Empath API(C) are useful for creating future multimodal emotional data about robot-patient interactions. The HRV analysis showed persistent sympathetic dominance, matching the human-robot conversational situation. The result of HCC was in agreement with that of human observation, in the case of rough consensus. In the case of observed results disagreed upon by experts, the HCC result was also different.

Goal conflicts can arise from simple trajectory planning to complex task prioritization. For successful human-robot goal-conflict resolution, humans and robots need to negotiate their goals and priorities. For this, the robot might be equipped with effective conflict resolution strategies to be assertive and effective but similarly accepted by the user. In this paper, conflict resolution strategies for service robots (public cleaning robot, home assistant robot) are developed by transferring psychological concepts (e.g., negotiation, cooperation) to HRI. Altogether, fifteen strategies were grouped by the expected affective outcome (positive, neutral, negative). In two online experiments, the acceptability of and compliance with these conflict resolution strategies were tested with humanoid and mechanic robots in two application contexts (public: n(1) = 61; private: n(2) = 93). To obtain a comparative value, the strategies were also applied by a human. As additional outcomes trust, fear, arousal, and valence, as well as perceived politeness of the agent were assessed. The positive/neutral strategies were found to be more acceptable and effective than negative strategies. Some negative strategies (i.e., threat, command) even led to reactance and fear. Some strategies were only positively evaluated and effective for certain agents (human or robot) or only acceptable in one of the two application contexts (i.e., approach, empathy). Influences on strategy acceptance and compliance in the public context could be found: acceptance was predicted by politeness and trust. Compliance was predicted by interpersonal power. Taken together, psychological conflict resolution strategies can be applied in HRI to enhance robot task effectiveness. If applied robot-specifically and context-sensitively they are accepted by the user. The contribution of this paper is twofold: conflict resolution strategies based on Human Factors and Social Psychology are introduced and empirically evaluated in two online studies for two application contexts. Influencing factors and requirements for the acceptance and effectiveness of robot assertiveness are discussed.","2021-01-26","2022-07-15 14:59:27","2022-07-15 14:59:27","","","","","7","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND Publisher: FRONTIERS MEDIA SA Type: Article","","","","acceptance; HRI strategies; persuasive robots; robot assertiveness; trust; user compliance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this paper is to investigate whether human-beings trust a social robot-i.e. a human-like robot that embodies emotional states, empathy, and non-verbal communication-differently than other types of agents. To do so, we adapt the well-known economic trust-game proposed by Charness and Dufwenberg (2006) to assess whether receiving a promise from a robot increases human-trust in it. We find that receiving a promise from the robot increases the trust of the human in it, but only for individuals who perceive the robot very similar to a human-being. Importantly, we observe a similar pattern in choices when we replace the humanoid counterpart with a real human but not when it is replaced by a computer-box. Additionally, we investigate participants' psychophysiological reaction in terms of cardiovascular and electrodermal activity. Our results highlight an increased psychophysiological arousal when the game is played with the social robot compared to the computer-box.

In social neuroscience, many experiments have sought to first define and then locate `perspective taking', `empathy', and other psychological concepts to specific brain circuits. Seldom, bottom-up studies were conducted to first identify explanatory patterns of brain variation, which are then related to psychological concepts; perhaps due to a lack of large population datasets. In this spirit, we performed a systematic de-construction of social brain morphology into its elementary building blocks, involving similar to 10,000 UK Biobank participants. We explored coherent representations of structural co-variation at population scale within a recent social brain atlas, by translating autoencoder neural networks from deep learning. The learned subnetworks revealed essential patterns of structural relationships between social brain regions, with the nucleus accumbens, medial prefrontal cortex, and temporoparietal junction embedded at the core. Some of the uncovered subnetworks contributed to predicting examined social traits in general, while other subnetworks helped predict specific facets of social functioning, such as the experience of social isolation. As a consequence of our population-level evidence, spatially overlapping subsystems of the social brain probably relate to interindividual differences in everyday social life. Kiesow et al. use deep learning to identify partially overlapping subnetworks in the human social brain at the population level. They also demonstrate that the learned subnetwork representations can be used to predict social traits.","2021-01-14","2022-07-15 14:59:27","2022-07-15 14:59:27","","","","1","4","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY Publisher: NATURE PORTFOLIO Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent research and experience have shone further light on factors influencing the implementation and usefulness of these approaches, as well as unresolved challenges and unintended consequences. These are considered in relation to not only digital technology and infrastructure, but also wider aspects of health systems, the nature of primary care work and culture, patient characteristics and inequalities, and ethical issues around data privacy, inclusion, empowerment, empathy and trust. Implications for the future direction and sustainability of these approaches are discussed, taking account of novel paradigms, such as artificial intelligence, and the growing capture of primary care data for secondary uses. Decision makers are encouraged to think holistically about where value is most likely to be added, or risks being taken away, when judging which innovations to carry forward.

Through effective design we investigated the possible answers that could leverage the limitations and the challenges in developing storytelling applications through a robotic medium. Our preliminary findings show that the use of an embodied agent such as a robot in storytelling only has meaning when its communicative affordance (i.e. embodiment, expressiveness, and other modalities) is tapped, adding new dimension to the experience. Otherwise, traditional storytelling delivery (e.g. tablet) without the use of embodiment will suffice.

Empathy can contribute to understanding and supporting others' needs. In most cases, empathy in young children is developed through listening to sad stories, experienced first-hand by others. In the educational scenario presented in this article, the dramatic effects of climate change were conveyed to the pupils through a message said to originate from the future, delivered by an educational robot. The message was expressed by a peer living in Iran in 2050. In addition to delivering the message, the robot called on children to prevent climate change from rapidly worsening by changing their own way of thinking and attitudes. Thus, students called upon a formulated educational problem to understand and handle through their own emotional and cognitive performance through the robot's storytelling. This performance was intensely affected by empathy towards the Iranian peer's difficult personal living conditions. The research focused on measuring the evidence of empathy development. Additionally, the design and implementation aspects of the robot are presented, utilizing the implemented teaching intervention as means of demonstrating the innovative nature of the robot.","2021-10","2022-07-15 14:59:27","2022-07-15 14:59:27","","","","19","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND Publisher: MDPI Type: Article","","","","climate change; educational robot; empathy; primary education; sustainability; teaching scenario","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To foster close relationships and lasting engagements between humans and robots, empathy models can provide direct clues into how it can be done. In this study, we focus on capturing in a quantitative way indicators of early empathy realization between a human and a robot using a process that encompasses affective attachment, trust, expectations and reflecting on the other's perspective within a set of collaborative strategies. We hypothesize that an active collaboration strategy is conducive to a more meaningful and purposeful engagement of realizing empathy between a human and a robot compared to a passive one. With a deliberate design, the interaction with the robot was presented as a maze game where a human and a robot must collaborate in order to reach the goal using two strategies: one maintaining control individually taking turns (passive strategy) and the other one where both must agree on their next move based on reflection and argumentation. Quantitative and qualitative analysis of the pilot study confirmed that a general sense of closeness with the robot was perceived when applying the active strategy. Regarding the specific indicators of empathy realization: (1) affective attachment, affective emulation was equally present throughout the experiment in both conditions, and thus, no conclusion could be reached; (2) trust, quantitative analysis partially supported the hypothesis that an active collaborative strategy will promote teamwork attitudes, where the human is open to the robot's suggestions and to act as a teammate; and (3) regulating expectation, quantitative analysis confirmed that a collaborative strategy promoted a discovery process that regulates the subject's expectation toward the robot. Overall, we can conclude that an active collaborative strategy impacts favorably the process of realizing empathy compared to a passive one. The results are compelling to move the design of this experiment forward into more comprehensive studies, ultimately leading to a path where we can clearly study engagements that reduce abandonment and disillusionment with the process of realizing empathy as the core design for active collaborative strategies.","","2022-07-15 14:59:27","2022-07-15 14:59:27","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article; Early Access","","","","Attachment; Collaboration; Empathy realization process; Expectation; Human-robot interaction; Trust","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this work, we leverage advances in the field of natural language processing to create a dialogue system that can convincingly generate empathic responses to text-based messages. To improve the system's ability to converse with empathy, we train the language model on empathic conversations and inject additional emotional information in the response generation. We propose two chatbots: a benchmark bot and an empathic bot. Additionally, we implement an emotion classifier that allows us to predict the emotional state of text-based messages. We evaluate both chatbots in quantitative studies and compare them with human responses in qualitative studies involving human judges. Our evaluation shows that our empathic chatbot outperforms the benchmark bot and even the human-generated responses in terms of perceived empathy. Additionally, we achieve state-of-the-art results in terms of response quality using transformer-based language models.

Human senses have evolved to recognise sensory cues. Beyond our perception, they play an integral role in our emotional processing, learning, and interpretation. They are what help us to sculpt our everyday experiences and can be triggered by aesthetics to form the foundations of our interactions with each other and our surroundings. In terms of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), robots have the possibility to interact with both people and environments given their senses. They can offer the attributes of human characteristics, which in turn can make the interchange with technology a more appealing and admissible experience. However, for many reasons, people still do not seem to trust and accept robots. Trust is expressed as a person's ability to accept the potential risks associated with participating alongside an entity such as a robot. Whilst trust is an important factor in building relationships with robots, the presence of uncertainties can add an additional dimension to the decision to trust a robot. In order to begin to understand how to build trust with robots and reverse the negative ideology, this paper examines the influences of aesthetic design techniques on the human ability to trust robots. Method. This paper explores the potential that robots have unique opportunities to improve their facilities for empathy, emotion, and social awareness beyond their more cognitive functionalities. Through conducting an online questionnaire distributed globally, we explored participants ability and acceptance in trusting the Canbot U03 robot. Participants were presented with a range of visual questions which manipulated the robot's facial screen and asked whether or not they would trust the robot. A selection of questions aimed at putting participants in situations where they were required to establish whether or not to trust a robot's responses based solely on the visual appearance. We accomplished this by manipulating different design elements of the robots facial and chest screens, which influenced the human-robot interaction. Results. We found that certain facial aesthetics seem to be more trustworthy than others, such as a cartoon face versus a human face, and that certain visual variables (i.e., blur) afforded uncertainty more than others. Consequentially, this paper reports that participant's uncertainties of the visualisations greatly influenced their willingness to accept and trust the robot. The results of introducing certain anthropomorphic characteristics emphasised the participants embrace of the uncanny valley theory, where pushing the degree of human likeness introduced a thin line between participants accepting robots and not. By understanding what manipulation of design elements created the aesthetic effect that triggered the affective processes, this paper further enriches our knowledge of how we might design for certain emotions, feelings, and ultimately more socially acceptable and trusting robotic experiences.","2022-01-14","2022-07-15 14:59:27","2022-07-15 14:59:27","","","","","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 341-345 OLD ST, THIRD FLR, LONDON, EC1V 9LL, ENGLAND Publisher: PEERJ INC Type: Article","","","","Aesthetics; Risk; Robot; Trust","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To maintain a healthy interpersonal relationship through text messaging, our negative mental states, such as anger, have to be well-controlled. This paper discusses the use of a handheld social robot deployed as a mediator in text messaging between humans. The robot is equipped with a movable weight inside its body. By controlling the movement of the internal weight during the time when the robot speaks out messages received from a human sender, we hypothesize that the psychological state of a receiver who holds the robot can be affected (for example, he/she will listen to the messages more seriously). In a controlled study (n = 94), in which participants were manipulated to be frustrated by using a context scenario, we studied the effect of three dialogue scripts with/without weight shifts. Results showed that introducing weight shifts together with the robot speech suppressed on average 23% of the user's anger. However, only 3.5% of the anger was suppressed when the weight shifts were not applied. Additionally, in cases where the robot showed empathy to the user in words with weight shifts, the user's revenge urge was successfully reduced by 22%. There was almost no effect confirmed when the weight shifts were not applied. A similar effect was also found in avoidance motivation: 15% of the avoidance motivation was reduced if weight shifts were applied. The reductions in revenge and avoidance motivation are considered important factors for human forgiveness. Therefore, our findings provide experimental evidence that weight shifts can be an effective expression modality for mediator robots, from the perspective of not only suppressing the user's anger but also by inducing forgiveness during messaging.","2022-02-28","2022-07-15 14:59:27","2022-07-15 14:59:27","","","","","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND Publisher: FRONTIERS MEDIA SA Type: Article","","","","anger suppression; handheld device; inducing forgiveness; seriousness; social mediator robot; text messaging; weight shift","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Results revealed that, compared with the human (expert) recommendation service, the AI recommendation service increased perceived technology quality, which increased personalization quality. Technology and personalization quality had a positive influence on behavioral intentions, mediated by perceived empathy. In addition, when individuals had a high level of need for cognition, the effect of personalization quality on empathy was stronger. However, individuals with a low level of need for cognition perceived greater empathy, as technology quality increased.

Adaptivity of systems can be evaluated by considering the technical system features, user-interface-related features and the actual user experience of the adaptive system. We provide an overview of classifications for adaptive systems including the Levels of Adaptive Sensitive Responses (LASR). The levels differentiate the input that a system considers in its operations to adapt to user groups or to the individual user. Along with that, we propose User Experience (UX) design guidelines applicable to the different levels. In an online survey, we varied LASR and one of the UX design guidelines, namely transparency. The within-subjects study showed that both, the levels and the variation of transparency, influenced the perception of intelligence, transparency and intuitive design. However, a significant proportion of users did not understand the difference between the two LASR versions, indicating that users build mental models of systems that imply more personal data usage than the system actually employs. The LASR framework allowed this differentiation to be revealed in system performance and user perception. More research is necessary to elaborate the correlation between levels of adaptivity, UX design, specific UX design guidelines and user experience measures.","2022-05","2022-07-15 14:59:27","2022-07-15 14:59:27","","4866-4876","","5","23","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA Publisher: IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC Type: Article","","","","Adaptive algorithms; adaptive systems; Adaptive systems; affective computing; Automation; Automobiles; human-computer interaction; Intelligent systems; intelligent vehicles; interactive systems; road vehicles; Task analysis; User experience; user interfaces; Vehicles","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

According to behavioral economics and neuropsychology, empathy may be an inherent mechanism to elicit prosocial behaviors. Therefore, we establish a three-layer general framework of empathetic AI (eAI) with emotion, empathy, and decision-making. By introducing different sub-models, three learning structures based on eAI are proposed, including a gradient ascent (GA)-based structure, an adaptive learning structure, and a practical learning structure. The dynamics of the first two structures are analyzed theoretically, and the practical dynamics are tested in games. We prove that in the prisoner's dilemma (PD) environment, the GA-based eAI with neutral assessment can carry out adaptive cooperation and competition under the premise of self-security. In addition, although the modeling of empathy by extracting the emotional contagion and limited cognitive regulation is simplified and primitive, tests in the prisoner's dilemma, the ultimatum game, and a multi-agent dilemma game, show that the eAI structure successfully elicits prosocial behaviors including altruism, cooperation and fairness. Compared with other socialized algorithms, the eAI structure has a more comprehensive coverage in terms of convergence, fairness, security, adaptability, and structural expansibility. Therefore, we believe this work can provide novel methods and insights for regulating the behaviors of socialized agents, as well as artificial subjects in psychological and economic experiments.","2022-04","2022-07-15 14:59:28","2022-07-15 14:59:28","","6692-6722","","6, SI","52","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article","","","","Adaptive empathy; Cooperation and competition; Multi-agent reinforcement learning; Prosocial behaviors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One such approach involves asking participants to inflict `harm' on a robot. Researchers are interested in the length of time between the experimenter issuing the instruction and the participant complying, and propose that relatively long periods of hesitation might reflect empathy for the robot, and perhaps even attribution of human-like qualities, such as agency and sentience. In a recent experiment, we adapted the so-called `hesitance to hit' paradigm, in which participants were instructed to hit a humanoid robot on the head with a mallet. After standing up to do so (signaling intent to hit the robot), participants were stopped, and then took part in a semi-structured interview to probe their thoughts and feelings during the period of hesitation. Thematic analysis of the responses indicate that hesitation not only reflects perceived socialness, but also other factors including (but not limited to) concerns about cost, mallet disbelief, processing of the task instruction, and the influence of authority. The open-ended, free responses participants provided also offer rich insights into individual differences with regards to anthropomorphism, perceived power imbalances, and feelings of connection toward the robot. In addition to aiding understanding of this measurement technique and related topics regarding socialness attribution to robots, we argue that greater use of open questions can lead to exciting new research questions and interdisciplinary collaborations in the domain of social robotics.","2021-02-25","2022-07-15 14:59:28","2022-07-15 14:59:28","","","","","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND Publisher: FRONTIERS MEDIA SA Type: Article","","","","empathy; human- robot interaction; prosocial behaviour; qualitative research; social perception; social robotics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our within subjects design had two conditions: with and without emotional behaviour modifiers to the robot's behaviour. Our primary research question is whether behaviours that conveyed emotion as well as needs would lead to empathy in the participants, which would create a stronger helper's high effect than purely functional need expression behaviours. We present a long-term (4 day) remote study design that not only facilitates the kind of interactions needed for helper's high, but abides by government guidelines on Covid-19 safety (under which a laboratory study is not possible).

Practical implications: As private companies are typically more advanced in the implementation of AI technologies, the for-profit sector may provide significant contributions in the way states can leverage public services through the deployment of AI technologies. Originality/Value: This article highlights the need for states to create the necessary conditions to legislate and regulate key technological advances, which, in our opinion, has been done, but at a very slow pace.","2021","2022-07-15 14:59:28","2022-07-15 14:59:28","","","","3","18","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: AV PROF ALMEIDA PRADO 531, 1O ANDAR, SALA 102, SAO PAULO, 05508-900, BRAZIL Publisher: ASSOC BRASILEIRA ENGENHARIA PRODUCAO-ABEPRO Type: Review","","","","Artificial Intelligence; Employment; Policy; Public Services; Robotics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we surveyed United States adults (n = 1,061) on their views regarding granting 1) general legal protection, 2) legal personhood, and 3) standing to bring forth a lawsuit, with respect to sentient AI and eight other groups: humans in the jurisdiction, humans outside the jurisdiction, corporations, unions, non-human animals, the environment, humans living in the near future, and humans living in the far future. Roughly one-third of participants endorsed granting personhood and standing to sentient AI (assuming its existence) in at least some cases, the lowest of any group surveyed on, and rated the desired level of protection for sentient AI as lower than all groups other than corporations. We further investigated and observed political differences in responses; liberals were more likely to endorse legal protection and personhood for sentient AI than conservatives. Taken together, these results suggest that laypeople are not by-and-large in favor of granting legal protection to AI, and that the ordinary conception of legal status, similar to codified legal doctrine, is not based on a mere capacity to feel pleasure and pain. At the same time, the observed political differences suggest that previous literature regarding political differences in empathy and moral circle expansion apply to artificially intelligent systems and extend partially, though not entirely, to legal consideration, as well.","2021-11-26","2022-07-15 14:59:28","2022-07-15 14:59:28","","","","","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND Publisher: FRONTIERS MEDIA SA Type: Article","","","","artificial intelligence; artificial intelligence and law; legal personhood; legal standing; moral circle; moral standing; robot rights","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Two types of electronic instructors, a robot and a tablet computer, were located close to the disposal area to provide instructions on appropriate waste disposal. The comparison of the effectiveness of the two types of electronic instructors found that participants exposed to the robot sorted the waste more accurately than participants exposed to the tablet computer.

These games respectively place the player in the role of multicultural manager, racial empath, and divine avatar. These games show us the many logics, strategies, and appropriations that can occur when diversity itself is treated not as a complex process toward building social justice, but as an obtainable asset, and as the sole win condition in making and selling a game. Attending to these racial logics can open paths to new disciplinary directions in game studies by pushing beyond established domestic boundaries, liberal multiculturalist definitions of diversity, and ultimately into revealing our regional attitudes and particular ways of defining and practicing “diversity.”","","2022-07-15 14:59:28","2022-07-15 14:59:28","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND Publisher: ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD Type: Article; Early Access","","","","Asian American; diversity; Game studies; race; role-playing games","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Voice bot's voice search can interact on the same level as face-to-face communication and provide customized services optimized for users. It is most important for these new technologies to develop from a non-face-to-face social structure caused by COVID-19 to a long-term sustainable technology rather than short-term development. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to empirically verify the structural relationship between the quality, interactivity, and consumers' sustainable use intentions for voice search services called `voice bots' in Korea, an advanced country of computer science and technology. A survey was conducted on Korean consumers aged 20 or older who use voice search services, and the following main results were derived. First, the playfulness, certainty, and empathy of the `voice bot' have a positive effect on the interactivity with the `voice bot'. Second, interactivity with the `voice bot' has a positive effect on consumers' sustainable use intention. Third, the playfulness and certainty of `voice bot' have a positive effect on consumers' sustainable use intention. Fourth, the playfulness, certainty, and empathy of the `voice bot' have a positive effect on consumers' sustainable use intention through interactivity with the `voice bot'. This study is meaningful in that it empirically identified the importance of interactivity by deriving the service quality factors required for sustainable use of voice search services, one of the new innovative technologies.","2021-12","2022-07-15 14:59:28","2022-07-15 14:59:28","","","","24","13","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND Publisher: MDPI Type: Article","","","","non-face-to-face service; service quality; sustainable interaction; sustainable technological innovation; voice big data; voice bot; voice search service","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the experimental condition, the robotic object performed emphatic gestures, modeled according to the behavior of a trained therapist. In the baseline condition, the robotic object performed up-and-down gestures, without directing attention towards the participants. Findings show that the robot's empathy-related gestures significantly improved the emotional support quality provided by one participant to another, as indicated by both subjective and objective measures. The non-humanoid robot was perceived as peripheral to the natural human-human interaction and influenced participants' behavior without interfering.

Due to the open challenge in finding perfect Bayesian equilibria of such games, existing studies often decouple the belief and physical dynamics by iterating between belief update and motion planning. Importantly, the robot's reward parameters are often assumed to be known to the humans, in order to simplify the computation. We show in this paper that under this simplification, the robot performs non-empathetic belief update about the humans' parameters, which causes high safety risks in uncontrolled intersection scenarios. In contrast, we propose a model for empathetic belief update, where the agent updates the joint probabilities of all agents' parameter combinations. The update uses a neural network that approximates the Nash equilibrial action-values of agents. We compare empathetic and non-empathetic belief update methods on a two-vehicle uncontrolled intersection case with short reaction time. Results show that when both agents are unknowingly aggressive (or non-aggressive), empathy is necessary for avoiding collisions when agents have false believes about each others' parameters. This paper demonstrates the importance of acknowledging the incomplete-information nature of HRI.","2021","2022-07-15 14:59:28","2022-07-15 14:59:28","","2761-2767","","","","","","","IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation ICRA","","","","IEEE","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: IEEE; IEEE Robot & Automat Soc; So Univ Sci & Technol; Harbin Inst Technol; Xian Jiaotong Univ; Univ Toronto; Nat Sci & Engn Res Council Canada; Chinese Univ Hong Kong; DJI; Biomimet Intelligence & Robot; Toyota Res Inst; Baidu; Mech Mind Robot Technologies; Facebook AI; Nokov; Manycore; Franka Emika; Zhejiang Univ, Huzhou Inst; Jing Tian; ATI Ind Automat; Amber; Direct Drive Tech; Inceptio; Flexiv; Deeproute AI; Unitree; Waymo; Kuka; Pudu Robot; Deep Robot; Nvidia; MathWorks ISSN: 1050-4729 Type: Proceedings Paper","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, progress is not always followed by ethical reflection on its consequences or scientists' responsibility for their creations. The humanities can help health sciences students learn to critically analyse these issues; in particular, literature can aid discussions about ethical principles in biomedical research. Mary Shelley's Frankenstein; or, the modern Prometheus (1818) is an example of a classic novel presenting complex scenarios that could be used to stimulate discussion. Main text Within the framework of the 200th anniversary of the novel, we searched PubMed to identify works that explore and discuss its value in teaching health sciences. Our search yielded 56 articles, but only two of these reported empirical findings. Our analysis of these articles identified three main approaches to using Frankenstein in teaching health sciences: discussing the relationship between literature and science, analysing ethical issues in biomedical research, and examining the importance of empathy and compassion in healthcare and research. After a critical discussion of the articles, we propose using Frankenstein as a teaching tool to prompt students to critically analyse ethical aspects of scientific and technological progress, the need for compassion and empathy in medical research, and scientists' responsibility for their discoveries. Conclusion Frankenstein can help students reflect on the personal and social limits of science, the connection between curiosity and scientific progress, and scientists' responsibilities. Its potential usefulness in teaching derives from the interconnectedness of science, ethics, and compassion. Frankenstein can be a useful tool for analysing bioethical issues related to scientific and technological advances, such as artificial intelligence, genetic engineering, and cloning. Empirical studies measuring learning outcomes are necessary to confirm the usefulness of this approach.","2021-02-23","2022-07-15 14:59:28","2022-07-15 14:59:28","","","","1","22","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND Publisher: BMC Type: Article","","","","Bioethics; Frankenstein; Health sciences; responsibility; Science fiction; Scientists&#8217; Teaching","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

From an organizational perspective, AI devices have several advantages, by performing certain tasks quicker and more accurately in comparison to humans while at the same time being more cost-efficient. However, in order to maintain the high standards of a brand, they have to be accepted by consumers and deliver socially adequate performance. Therefore, it is important to determine the characteristics of AI devices which make them accepted and trusted by consumers. Based on the Computers as Social Actors (CASA) Theory, we have researched on the role of psychological anthropomorphic characteristics, perceived empathy, and interaction quality in the acceptance of AI devices in the service industry. The results show that anthropomorphic characteristics alone do not influence acceptance and trust towards AI devices. However, both perceived empathy and interaction quality mediate the relation between anthropomorphic characteristics and acceptance. A human-like AI device has higher acceptance when it has the ability to show empathy and interaction in relation to the human consumer. This result reveals the importance of developing forms of strong intelligence and empathetic behaviour in service robots and AI devices.","2021-09","2022-07-15 14:59:28","2022-07-15 14:59:28","","","","","122","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND Publisher: PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD Type: Article","","","","AI device; Anthropomorphism; Artificial intelligence; Computers as social actors; Consumer behaviour; Human-AI interaction; Human-computer interaction; Robots","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Moreover, the translation from research to a valuable and affordable product/process innovation is not formalized by the current teachings that focus on short-term rather than long-term developments, leading to inaccurate and incremental forecasting on the future of healthcare and longevity. The Stanford Biodesign approach of unmet clinical need detection would be an excellent starting methodology for health-related innovation work, although unfortunately not widely taught yet. We have developed a novel lecture titled HealthTec Innovation Design (HTID) offered in an interdisciplinary setup to medical students and biomedical engineers. It teaches a future-oriented view and the application and effects of exponential trends. We implemented a novel approach using the Purpose Launchpad meta-methodology combined with other innovation generation tools to define, experiment, and validate existing project ideas. As part of the process of defining the novel curriculum, we used experimentation methods, like a global science fiction event to create a comic book with Future Health stories and an Innovation Think Tank Certification Program of a large medical technology company that is focused on identifying future health opportunities. We conducted before and after surveys and concluded that the proposed initiatives were impactful in developing an innovative design thinking approach. Participants' awareness and enthusiasm were raised, including their willingness to implement taught skills, values, and methods in their working projects.

Digital health technologies are at the forefront of this transition in facilitating a role for the patient in the clinical dimensions of the healthcare trajectory, from diagnosis and interventions to treatment and recovery. Despite this prevalence in the clinical space, the non-clinical needs of patient mental health and wellbeing are frequently overlooked by contemporary patient-centered healthcare models. Conversational agents (or chatbots) are digital dialogue systems that are widespread and widely used in sequential information provision and information acquisition tasks. Given the intimate nature of this human-machine interaction, conversational agents can be effectively utilized to support and sustain patient mental health and wellbeing. In this paper, we propose an empathic conversational agent framework based on an ensemble of natural language processing techniques and artificial intelligence algorithms for real-time monitoring and co-facilitation of patient-centered healthcare for improved mental health and wellbeing outcomes. The technical contributions of this framework are; detection of patient emotions, prediction of patient emotion transitions, detection of group emotions, formulation of patient behavioral metrics, and resource recommendations based on patient concerns. The architectural contributions of the framework are intelligent communication channels that stream empathic conversational elements and resource recommendations for the multi-user conversations and co-facilitation updates for the human healthcare provider interface. The framework was empirically evaluated on a benchmark dataset and further validated based on a clinical protocol designed for its application in an online support group setting for cancer patients and caregivers in Canada.

Additionally, it is argued that extant HRI research often fails to recognize the complexity of empathy and sympathy, such that the two concepts are frequently treated as synonymous. The arguments for these claims occur in two steps. First, it is argued that there are at least three understandings of empathy, such that particular care is needed when researching “empathy” in human-robot interactions. The phenomenological approach to empathy-perhaps the least utilized of the three discussed understandings-is the approach with the most direct implications for moral standing. Furthermore, because “empathy” and “sympathy” are often conflated, a novel account of sympathy which makes clear the difference between the two concepts is presented, and the importance for these distinctions is argued for. In the second step, the phenomenological insights presented before regarding the nature of empathy are applied to the problem of robot moral standing to argue that empathetic and sympathetic engagement with an entity constitute an ethical engagement with it. The paper concludes by offering several potential research questions that result from the phenomenological analysis of empathy in human-robot interactions.","2022-01-03","2022-07-15 14:59:28","2022-07-15 14:59:28","","","","","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND Publisher: FRONTIERS MEDIA SA Type: Article","","","","empathy; HRI; moral status; phenomenology; social robot; sympathy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The best performing pessimism and optimism detection models are based on bidirectional long-and short-term memory networks.Experimental results on four periods of the COVID-19 pandemic show how the proposed approach can model optimism and pessimism in the context of a health crisis. There is a total of 150,503 tweets and 51,319 unique users. Conversations are characterised in terms of emotional signals and shifts to unravel empathy and support mechanisms. Conversations with stronger pessimistic signals denoted little emotional shift (i.e. 62.21% of these conversations experienced almost no change in emotion). In turn, only 10.42% of the conversations laying more on the optimistic side maintained the mood.

I present arguments in favour of the position that people actually do empathise with robots. I also consider what circumstances shape human empathy with these entities. I propose that two basic classes of such factors be distinguished: biological and socio-cognitive. In my opinion, one of the most important among them is a sense of group membership with robots, as it modulates the empathic responses to representatives of our- and other- groups. The sense of group membership with robots may be co-shaped by socio-cognitive factors such as one's experience, familiarity with the robot and its history, motivation, accepted ontology, stereotypes or language. Finally, I argue in favour of the formulation of a pragmatic and normative framework for manipulations in the level of empathy in human-robot interactions.","2022-03","2022-07-15 14:59:29","2022-07-15 14:59:29","","341-355","","2","14","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article","","","","Anthropomorphism; Empathy; Human-robot interactions; Social robots","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Social media platforms such as Google reviews and hotel review blogs/websites were used to gather 400 public reviews. A Naive Bayes machine learning Sentiment Analysis approach was used to identify critical areas to improve service delivery, customer relationship, and hospitality management in wellness resorts. Tangibility was identified as the most important dimension followed by empathy, assurance, reliability, and responsiveness. Assurance, empathy, and reliability have the most negative sentiments shared by tourists. Food quality, rooms and accommodation facilities, safety and security, attitude towards customer complaints, the behaviour of the staff, error-free services, and proper training are areas upon which Indian wellness resorts should focus. This study intends to identify additional constructs in future research and build robust models to actively rank the important factors for better customer engagement.

Similarly, assessment of human personality is highly critical in realizing natural and intelligent human-robot interaction. Numerous personality traits assessment systems have been reported in the literature; however, most of them target the big five personality traits. From only visual information, this work proposes to use pleasure, arousal, and dominance emotional space for the assessment of personality traits based on the work of Mehrabian. To validate the system, three different scenarios have been developed to assess 12 different personality traits on a social humanoid robot. Experimental results show that the system can assess human personality traits with 84% accuracy in real-time and, hence, it can adapt its behavior according to the perceived personality of the interaction partner.","2021","2022-07-15 14:59:29","2022-07-15 14:59:29","","111-118","","","","","","","","","","","SCITEPRESS","AV D MANUELL, 27A 2 ESQ, SETUBAL, 2910-595, PORTUGAL","English","","","","","","","Type: Proceedings Paper","","","","Human-Robot Interaction; PAD Emotional Space; Personality Trait Assessment; Robot Adaptivity","","Paljic, A; Peck, T; Braz, J; Bouatouch, K","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Pediatric neurological and psychological conditions can affect social cognition and require assessment and remediation of social skills. To adequately approximate the complex and dynamic nature of real-world social interactions, innovative tools are needed. The aim of this study was to document the performance of adolescents on two versions of a serious video game presenting realistic, everyday, socio-moral conflicts, and to explore whether their performance is associated with empathy or sense of presence, factors known to influence social cognition. MethodsParticipants (12-17 years, M = 14.39; SD = 1.35) first completed a pre-test measure of socio-moral reasoning based on three dilemmas from a previously validated computer task. Then, they either played an evaluative version (n = 24) or an adaptive (n = 33) version of a video game presenting nine social situations in which they made socio-moral decisions and provided justifications. In the evaluative version, participants' audio justifications were recorded verbatim and coded manually to obtain a socio-moral reasoning maturity score. In the adaptive version (AV), tailored feedback and social reinforcements were provided based on participant responses. An automatic coding algorithm developed using artificial intelligence was used to determine socio-moral maturity level in real-time and to provide a basis for the feedback and reinforcements in the game. All participants then completed a three-dilemma post-test assessment. ResultsThose who played the adaptive version showed improved SMR across the pre-test, in-game and post-test moral maturity scores, F(1.97,63.00) = 9.81, p(HF) < 0.001, epsilon(2) = 0.21, but those who played the Evaluative version did not. Socio-moral reasoning scores from both versions combined did not correlate with empathy or sense of presence during the game, though results neared significance. The study findings support preliminary validation of the game as a promising method for assessing and remediating social skills during adolescence.","2022-01-21","2022-07-15 14:59:29","2022-07-15 14:59:29","","","","","12","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND Publisher: FRONTIERS MEDIA SA Type: Article","","","","adolescence; assessment; empathy; intervention; moral reasoning; neuropsychology; presence; serious video games","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Automated, objective pain detection from physiological data in patients provides valuable information to hospital staff and caregivers to better manage pain, particularly for patients who are unable to self-report. Galvanic skin response (GSR) is one of the physiologic signals that refers to the changes in sweat gland activity, which can identify features of emotional states and anxiety induced by varying pain levels. This study used different statistical features extracted from GSR data collected from postoperative patients to detect their pain intensity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work building pain models using postoperative adult patients instead of healthy subjects. Objective: The goal of this study was to present an automatic pain assessment tool using GSR signals to predict different pain intensities in noncommunicative, postoperative patients. Methods: The study was designed to collect biomedical data from postoperative patients reporting moderate to high pain levels. We recruited 25 participants aged 23-89 years. First, a transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) unit was employed to obtain patients' baseline data. In the second part, the Empatica E4 wristband was worn by patients while they were performing low-intensity activities. Patient self-report based on the numeric rating scale (NRS) was used to record pain intensities that were correlated with objectively measured data. The labels were down-sampled from 11 pain levels to 5 different pain intensities, including the baseline. We used 2 different machine learning algorithms to construct the models. The mean decrease impurity method was used to find the top important features for pain prediction and improve the accuracy. We compared our results with a previously published research study to estimate the true performance of our models. Results: Four different binary classification models were constructed using each machine learning algorithm to classify the baseline and other pain intensities (Baseline [BL] vs Pain Level [PL] 1, BL vs PL2, BL vs PL3, and BL vs PL4). Our models achieved higher accuracy for the first 3 pain models than the BioVid paper approach despite the challenges in analyzing real patient data. For BL vs PL1, BL vs PL2, and BL vs PL4, the highest prediction accuracies were achieved when using a random forest classifier (86.0, 70.0, and 61.5, respectively). For BL vs PL3, we achieved an accuracy of 72.1 using a k-nearest-neighbor classifier. Conclusions: We are the first to propose and validate a pain assessment tool to predict different pain levels in real postoperative adult patients using GSR signals. We also exploited feature selection algorithms to find the top important features related to different pain intensities.","2021-05-05","2022-07-15 14:59:29","2022-07-15 14:59:29","","","","5","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 130 QUEENS QUAY E, STE 1102, TORONTO, ON M5A 0P6, CANADA Publisher: JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC Type: Article","","","","electrodermal activity; health monitoring; machine learning; pain assessment; post-op patients; recognition; wearable electronics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These suggestions are based on the claim that the question of robot rights should not depend on a standard set of conditions for `moral status'; but instead, the question is to be framed in a new way, by rejecting the is/ought distinction, making a relational turn, or assuming a methodological behaviourism. We try to clarify these suggestions and to show their highly problematic consequences. While we find the suggestions ultimately unmotivated, the discussion shows that our epistemic condition with respect to the moral status of others does raise problems, and that the human tendency to empathise with things that do not have moral status should be taken seriously-we suggest that it produces a “derived moral status”. Finally, it turns out that there is typically no individual in real AI that could even be said to be the bearer of moral status. Overall, there is no reason to think that robot rights are an issue now.","2021-12","2022-07-15 14:59:29","2022-07-15 14:59:29","","579-587","","4","23","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article","","","","AI; AMA; Artificial intelligence; Artificial moral agent; Ethical behaviourism; Ethics; Moral agent; Moral consideration; Moral patient; Moral status; Orchestration; Person; Relational turn; Rights; Robot","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Inspired by developmental robotics theory, EMRES has an internal state and a mood, which contribute in the evolution of the flow of emotions; at every episode, the next emotional state of the agent is affected by its internal state, mood, current emotion, and the expression read in the human partner. As a result, EMRES does not imitate, but it synchronizes to the emotion expressed by the human companion. The agent has been trained to recognize expressive faces of the FER2013 database and it is capable of achieving 78.3% performance with wild images.

Three experimental studies reveal that customers with low (vs. high) scores on anxious attachment style (AAS) measures respond more negatively to frontline service robot (compared to a frontline human agent). We investigate alternative explanations for these findings, such as robots' level of anthropomorphism and we show that human-likeness features such as voice type and level of human-like physical appearance, cannot explain our findings.

Reasons include lack of funds for specialist services, scarcity of trained mental health professionals, and the stigma attached to mental illness. In recent years there have been many studies demonstrating effective delivery of psychological interventions through a variety of non-specialists. While these interventions are cost-effective and less stigmatising, efforts to scale-up are hampered by issues of quality-control, and what has been described by implementation scientists as `voltage-drop' and `programme-drift.' Using principles of Human Centred Design in a rural setting in Pakistan, we worked with potential users to co-design a Tablet or Smartphone-based App that can assist a lay-person deliver the Thinking Healthy Programme, a World Health Organization-endorsed evidence-based intervention for perinatal depression. The active ingredients of this cognitive-therapy based intervention are delivered by a virtual `avatar' therapist incorporated into the App which is operated by a `peer' (a woman from the neighbourhood with no prior experience of healthcare delivery). Using automated cues from the App, the peer reinforces key therapeutic messages, helps with problem-solving and provides the non-specific but essential therapeutic elements of empathy and support.

The problem in question is the limited use of heart rate (HR) as the prediction feature through the use of common classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Random Forest (RF) in emotion prediction. This paper aims to investigate whether HR signals can be utilized to classify four-class emotions using the emotion model from Russell's in a virtual reality (VR) environment using machine learning. Method An experiment was conducted using the Empatica E4 wristband to acquire the participant's HR, a VR headset as the display device for participants to view the 360 degrees emotional videos, and the Empatica E4 real-time application was used during the experiment to extract and process the participant's recorded heart rate. Findings For intra-subject classification, all three classifiers SVM, KNN, and RF achieved 100% as the highest accuracy while inter-subject classification achieved 46.7% for SVM, 42.9% for KNN and 43.3% for RF. Conclusion The results demonstrate the potential of SVM, KNN and RF classifiers to classify HR as a feature to be used in emotion prediction in four distinct emotion classes in a virtual reality environment. The potential applications include interactive gaming, affective entertainment, and VR health rehabilitation.","2021-01-07","2022-07-15 14:59:29","2022-07-15 14:59:29","","","","1","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND Publisher: SPRINGERNATURE Type: Article","","","","Electrocardiography; Empatica E4; Four-class emotion classification; HR; KNN; Machine learning; RF; SVM; Virtual reality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The dataset contains data from 52 participants in total (26 women, and 26 men). The data for these participants was collected in two phases: 33 participants initially, and 19 further participants later on. Participants performed up to 5 repetitions of 24 different ADLs. Firstly, we provide an annotated description of the dataset collected by wearing a wrist-worn measurement device, Empatica E4. Secondly, we describe the methodology of the data collection and the real context in which participants performed the selected activities. Finally, we present some examples of recent and relevant target applications where our dataset can be used, namely lifelogging, behavioural analysis and measurement device evaluation.

Code-mixing and switching are linguistic behavior shown by the bilingual/multilingual population, primarily in spoken but also in written communication, especially on social media. Code-mixing involves combining lower linguistic units like words and phrases of a language into the sentences of other language (the base language) and code-switching involves switching to another language, for the length of one sentence or more. In code-mixing and switching, a bilingual person takes one or more words or phrases from one language and introduces them into another language while communicating in that language in spoken or written mode. People nowadays express their views and opinions on several issues on social media. In multilingual countries, people express their views using English as well as their native languages.

However, a considerable number of study results point in the opposite direction. There is currently no comprehensive common ground on the circumstances under which anthropomorphism promotes interaction with robots. Our meta-analysis aims to close this gap. A total of 4856 abstracts were scanned. After an extensive evaluation, 78 studies involving around 6000 participants and 187 effect sizes were included in this meta-analysis. The majority of the studies addressed effects on perceptual aspects of robots. In addition, effects on attitudinal, affective, and behavioral aspects were also investigated. Overall, a medium positive effect size was found, indicating a beneficial effect of anthropomorphic design features on human-related outcomes. However, closer scrutiny of the lowest variable level revealed no positive effect for perceived safety, empathy, and task performance. Moreover, the analysis suggests that positive effects of anthropomorphism depend heavily on various moderators. For example, anthropomorphism was in contrast to other fields of application, constantly facilitating social HRI. The results of this analysis provide insights into how design features can be used to improve the quality of HRI. Moreover, they reveal areas in which more research is needed before any clear conclusions about the effects of anthropomorphic robot design can be drawn.","2021-09-08","2022-07-15 14:59:29","2022-07-15 14:59:29","","","","58","6","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 1200 NEW YORK AVE, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20005 USA Publisher: AMER ASSOC ADVANCEMENT SCIENCE Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Best-evidence synthesis","AI & SOCIETY","","0951-5666","10.1007/s00146-021-01214-z","","Social robots are gradually entering children's lives in a period when children learn about social relationships and exercise prosocial behaviors with parents, peers, and teachers. Designed for long-term emotional engagement and to take the roles of friends, teachers, and babysitters, such robots have the potential to influence how children develop empathy. This article presents a review of the literature (2010-2020) in the fields of human-robot interaction (HRI), psychology, neuropsychology, and roboethics, discussing the potential impact of communication with social robots on children's social and emotional development. The critical analysis of evidence behind these discussions shows that, although robots theoretically have high chances of influencing the development of empathy in children, depending on their design, intensity, and context of use, there is no certainty about the kind of effect they might have. Most of the analyzed studies, which showed the ability of robots to improve empathy levels in children, were not longitudinal, while the studies observing and arguing for the negative effect of robots on children's empathy were either purely theoretical or dependent on the specific design of the robot and the situation. Therefore, there is a need for studies investigating the effects on children's social and emotional development of long-term regular and consistent communication with robots of various designs and in different situations.","2022-06","2022-07-15 14:59:29","2022-07-15 14:59:29","","579-589","","2","37","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article","","","","Children; Cognitive empathy; Communication; Early childhood; Empathy development; Social robots","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This retrospective study evaluated PES at a single university hospital between July 2016 and June 2018. Surveys were stratified by overall provider rating and self-identified provider gender. Adjectives from free-text survey comments were extracted using natural language processing techniques and applied to a statistical machine learning model to identify descriptors predictive of provider gender. 109,994 surveys were collected, 17,395 contained free-text comments describing 687 unique providers. The mean overall rating between male (8.84, n = 8558) and female (8.80, n = 8837) providers did not differ (p = 0.149). However, highly-rated male providers were more often described for their agentic qualities using adjectives such as “informative,” “forthright,” “superior,” and “utmost” (OR 1.48, p < 0.01)-whereas highly-rated female providers were more often described by their communal qualities through adjectives such as “empathetic,” “sweet,” “warm,” “attentive,” and “approachable” (OR 2.11, p < 0.0001). PES may contain gender stereotypes, raising questions about their impact on physicians and their validity as a quality metric which must be balanced with the need for unedited transparency.

We discuss an action-oriented account that emerges from a broader interpretation of the concept of sensorimotor contingencies. We suggest that dynamic informational and sensorimotor coupling across agents can mediate the deployment of action-effect contingencies in social contexts. We propose this concept of socializing sensorimotor contingencies (socSMCs) as a shared framework of analysis for processes within and across brains and bodies, and their physical and social environments. In doing so, we integrate insights from different fields, including neuroscience, psychology, and research on human-robot interaction. We review studies on dynamic embodied interaction and highlight empirical findings that suggest an important role of sensorimotor and informational entrainment in social contexts. Furthermore, we discuss links to closely related concepts, such as enactivism, models of coordination dynamics and others, and clarify differences to approaches that focus on mentalizing and high-level cognitive representations. Moreover, we consider conceptual implications of rethinking cognition as social sensorimotor coupling. The insight that social cognitive phenomena like joint attention, mutual trust or empathy rely heavily on the informational and sensorimotor coupling between agents may provide novel remedies for people with disturbed social cognition and for situations of disturbed social interaction. Furthermore, our proposal has potential applications in the field of human-robot interaction where socSMCs principles might lead to more natural and intuitive interfaces for human users.","2021-09-15","2022-07-15 14:59:30","2022-07-15 14:59:30","","","","","15","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND Publisher: FRONTIERS MEDIA SA Type: Article","","","","autism spectrum disorder; coordination dynamics; coupling; human-robot interaction; joint action; prediction; sensorimotor contingencies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design/methodology/approach Data collected from an electronic questionnaire include 433 responses from Spanish visitors. The authors subjected the variables proposed by De Kervenoael et al. (2020) adapted to museums. The initial descriptive analysis only showed significant differences by age (under or over 30 years old). Based on these previous results, an exploratory factor analysis was carried out to test the applicability of the questionnaire to museums. After identifying the factors, the authors applied an ANOVA test to determine whether there are age-related differences between the factors related to robot acceptance in museums. Findings The authors developed a multidimensional instrument for measuring willingness to accept social robots in museum contexts. Willingness is determined by three factors: museum visitor experience (which is a factor specific to museums), empathy and personal engagement (which are both usually relevant in other tourist sectors as well). The younger individuals (under 30 years old) have a higher degree of acceptance than do visitors over 30. Originality/value Social robot use in museums is still very low, so the key factors for their acceptance have yet to be ascertained. The specific skills of social robots could prove to be a major draw for young people and contribute significantly to the future of museums.","","2022-07-15 14:59:30","2022-07-15 14:59:30","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND Publisher: EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD Type: Article; Early Access","","","","Empathy; Experience; Human-robot interaction; Museums; Personal engagement; Social robot acceptance; Visitor profile","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the specific elements of patient-clinician communication that may support brain-to-brain concordance and therapeutic alliance are unknown. Here, we investigated how pain-related, directional facial communication between patients and clinicians is associated with brain-to-brain concordance. Patient-clinician dyads interacted in a pain-treatment context, during synchronous assessment of brain activity (fMRI hyperscanning) and online video transfer, enabling face-to-face social interaction. In-scanner videos were used for automated individual facial action unit (AU) time-series extraction. First, an interpretable machine-learning classifier of patients' facial expressions, from an independent fMRI experiment, significantly distinguished moderately painful leg pressure from innocuous pressure stimuli. Next, we estimated neural-network causality of patient-to-clinician directional information flow of facial expressions during clinician-initiated treatment of patients' evoked pain. We identified a leader-follower relationship in which patients predominantly led the facial communication while clinicians responded to patients' expressions. Finally, analyses of dynamic brain-to-brain concordance showed that patients' mid/posterior insular concordance with the clinicians' anterior insula cortex, a region identified in previously published data from this study(1), was associated with therapeutic alliance, and self-reported and objective (patient-to-clinician-directed causal influence) markers of negative-affect expressivity. These results suggest a role of patient-clinician concordance of the insula, a social-mirroring and salience-processing brain node, in mediating directional dynamics of pain-directed facial communication during therapeutic encounters.","2022-01-28","2022-07-15 14:59:30","2022-07-15 14:59:30","","","","1","12","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND Publisher: SPRINGERNATURE Type: Article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This article uses two methods for comparison accuracy. The first method is about using eye-tracking data to derive areas of interest in the video and to evaluate empathy with the image properties in the advertisement. The physical elements of the advertising pictures, such as characteristics of color, saturation, and value have been analyzed by comparing between advertising videos with and without consideration of gaze tracking for the region of interest of the video. Then the empathy in advertising has been determined by using the method of machine learning classification. The results showed that the accuracy rate was 1.8% higher than the other kinds of videos in feature value of considering the region of interest extraction by gaze tracking. Contribution: (1). The physical elements in the advertisement contribute to increase the viewer's empathy; (2).

What kinds of at canwe expect of early post-secondary computing students? In particular, can they meaningfully analyze computing systems that are well beyond their technical ken? Is their analysis limited to only a social or only a technical space? Method. In an introductory post-secondary course, we study student responses to questions designed to exercise at, broadly defined. To do this we develop a rubric that provides insight into desirable content. Results. We find that these students are fairly strong at at. They are regularly able to adopt an adversarial or empathetic viewpoint and analyze quite sophisticated systems. Most of all, they can meaningfully do so (a) outside an explicit cybersecurity context, (b) even from an introductory level, and (c) well before they understand well the key technologies under evaluation. On the other hand, we also find several instances where students do not explore systems as much as they could, and fail to reference other material they know, which could be evidence of lack of transfer. In addition, our rubric would benefit from refinement that would enable a more sophisticated analysis of student responses. Discussion. Our work provides a baseline evaluation of what we can expect from students. It suggests that at can be introduced early in the curriculum, and in contexts outside computer security.","2021","2022-07-15 14:59:30","2022-07-15 14:59:30","","213-224","","","","","","","","","","","ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY","1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: Assoc Comp Machinery; ACM Special Interest Grp Comp Sci Educ Type: Proceedings Paper","","","","adversarial thinking; creativity; functional fixedness; security","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous neuroimaging studies have indicated that neural responses of empathy for others' pain are modulated by an early automatic emotional sharing and a late controlled cognitive evaluation process. Recent studies about pain empathy for robots found humans present similar empathy process towards humanoid robots under painful stimuli as well as to humans. However, the whole-brain functional connectivity and the spatial dynamics of neural activities underlying empathic processes are still unknown. In the present study, the functional connectivity was investigated for ERPs recorded from 18 healthy adults who were presented with pictures of human hand and robot hand under painful and non-painful situations. Functional brain networks for both early and late empathy responses were constructed and a new parameter, empathy index (EI), was proposed to represent the empathy ability of humans quantitatively. We found that the mutual dependences between early ERP components was significantly decreased, but for the late components, there were no significant changes. The mutual dependences for human hand stimuli were larger than to robot hand stimuli for early components, but not for late components. The connectivity weights for early components were larger than late components. EI value shows significant difference between painful and non-painful stimuli, indicating it is a good indicator to represent the empathy of humans. This study enriches our understanding of the neurological mechanisms implicated in human empathy, and provides evidence of functional connectivity for both early and late responses of pain empathy towards humans and robots.","2021-01-22","2022-07-15 14:59:30","2022-07-15 14:59:30","","","","","151","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND Publisher: PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD Type: Article","","","","EEG; Empathy; Empathy index; Functional connectivity; Human-robot interaction; Mutual information","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using routine activity theory, this research examines whether increasing the perceived humanness of service robots reduces customer intentions to commit deviant consumer behaviour and whether this negative relationship is mediated by perceived empathy and perceived risk of being caught. Design/methodology/approach Five hundred and fifty-three US residents responded to a hypothetical scenario that manipulated the humanness of a service agent (from self-service technology, to robot, to human employee) across seven conditions and measured the likelihood of deviant consumer behaviour, empathy towards the service robot, perceived risk of being caught and punished and negative attitudes towards robots. Findings The results indicate that replacing human service agents with different types of service robots does inadvertently reduce customer perceptions of capable guardianship (i.e. the human element that deters potential offenders from committing crimes) in the servicescape and creates conditions that allow customers to perpetrate more deviant consumer behaviour. Practical implications When investing in technology such as service robots, service providers need to consider the unintended cost of customer misbehaviour (specifically deviant consumer behaviour) in their return-on-investment assessments to optimise their asset investment decisions. Originality/value Moving beyond research on customer adoption and use, this research examines the unintended consequences that might arise when deploying service robots in a technology-infused service environment. Humanised service robots offer more guardianship than self-service technology but do not replace human employees in preventing deviant consumer behaviour, as they remain more capable of deterring customer misbehaviour.","","2022-07-15 14:59:30","2022-07-15 14:59:30","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND Publisher: EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD Type: Article; Early Access","","","","Consumer deviance; Robotics; Service innovation; Servicescape","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Then we elaborate on the review from typical architectures, applications (e.g., industry, telemedicine, architecture, teleducation and others), and empathic computing. Next, we made an in-depth review of the papers from seven aspects: (1) collection and classification research, (2) using 3D scene reconstruction environments and live panorama, (3) periodicals and conducting research, (4) local and remote user interfaces, (5) features of user interfaces commonly used, (6) architecture and sharing non-verbal cues, (7) applications and toolkits. We find that most papers (160 articles, 74.4%) are published in conferences, using co-located collaboration to emulate remote collaboration is adopted by more than half (126, 58.6%) of the reviewed papers, the shared non-verbal cues can be mainly classified into five types (Virtual Replicas or Physical Proxy(VRP), AR Annotations or a Cursor Pointer (ARACP), avatar, gesture, and gaze), the local/remote interface is mainly divided into four categories (Head Mounted Displays(HMD), Spatial Augmented Reality(SAR), Windows-Icon-Menu-Pointer(WIMP) and Hand-Held Displays(HHD)). From this, we can draw ten conclusions. Following this we report on issues for future works. The paper also provides an overall academic roadmap and useful insight into the state-of-the-art of AR/MR remote collaboration on physical tasks. This work will be useful for current and future researchers who are interested in collaborative AR/MR systems.","2021-12","2022-07-15 14:59:30","2022-07-15 14:59:30","","","","","72","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND Publisher: PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD Type: Review","","","","Augmented Reality; Computer-supported collaborative work; Human-computer interaction; Mixed Reality; Physical tasks; Remote collaboration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Six male participants with professional driving experience were recruited and asked to complete daily trips in urban roadways of Chennai. The participants completed their trips in a sedan-type four-wheeler vehicle mounted with two cameras (near the rearview mirror) to record the traffic data and driver's in-vehicle behavior. An android phone mounted on the dashboard collected GPS and accelerometer data. The drivers wore an Empatica E4 device to record their physiological data, such as electrodermal activity, a key indicator of physiological stress. A holistic database assembled by linking different kinds of information was used to identify traffic events and road characteristics that can potentially impact the driver's physiological stress levels. This data was analyzed using a mixed-effects model. It was observed that U-turns and Protected Right turns in an intersection significantly increased the driver's stress. Additionally, slow-moving traffic in such scenarios further increased the effect. Merge Points serve as undesignated spaces for vehicle and pedestrian crossing and were identified as a contributor to the driver's stress. Alternatively, the presence of a median and a greater number of lanes significantly decreased the driver's stress. This paper reports a first-of-its-kind study conducted in India to assess the factors impacting driver's stress. Adopting measures and initiatives to modify the identified factors can help create a stress-free traffic environment for Indian drivers.","2022-10","2022-07-15 14:59:30","2022-07-15 14:59:30","","","","2","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND Publisher: SPRINGER INT PUBL AG Type: Article","","","","Electrodermal activity; Heterogeneous traffic; Mixed-effects model; Naturalistic driving study; Physiological stress","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In Mexico, the National Survey of Demographic Dynamics 2018, known by its Spanish acronym ENADID, collected information about breastfeeding practices. The ENADID survey is probabilistic and allows results to be generalized to the entire population in Mexico. Methods Information from a public database featuring 26,587 mother-baby pairs was analyzed by proportions, means and associations, as well as machine learning methods, to conduct a comparison among the pairs according to immediate skin-to-skin contact after delivery status. Results Skin-to-skin contact was described by 78.7% of the mothers and was associated with receiving an explanation regarding how to give breastmilk or the breast to the baby immediately following birth [Odds ratio (OR) 6.46; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 6.02, 6.97], initiating breastfeeding in the first hour of life (OR 2.01; 95% CI (1.84, 2.18) and a breastfeeding duration of >= 6 months (OR 1.16; 95% CI 1.08, 1.25). The breastfeeding duration, in days, was greater in the group with skin-to-skin contact than in the group without skin contact. Conclusions In Mexico, immediate and uninterrupted skin-to-skin contact between newborns and their mothers should be facilitated. Support should be provided to mothers to favor skin-to-skin contact and breasting initiation during the first hour of life, ideally through an empathic explanation by trained health personnel. Future research should focus on the evaluation of strategies to modify maternity services to facilitate immediate skin-to-skin contact after delivery and develop training programs for health personnel to support the initiation of breastfeeding during the first hour of life.","2022-07-07","2022-07-15 14:59:30","2022-07-15 14:59:30","","","","1","17","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND Publisher: BMC Type: Article","","","","Breastfeeding; Mexico; Mother-baby pair; Skin-to-skin contact","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The paper considers four dimensions of this issue: what, why, which, and how. The main thesis is that we need to build not just emotional intelligence, but also ersatz emotions, in autonomous social robots. Moral sentimentalism and moral functionalism are employed as the theoretical models. However, this paper argues that the popularly endorsed moral sentiment empathy is the wrong model to implement in social robots. In its stead, I propose the four moral sentiments (commiseration, shame/disgust, respect and deference, and the sense of right and wrong) in Confucian moral sentimentalism as our starting point for the top-down affective structure of robot design.","2021","2022-07-15 14:59:30","2022-07-15 14:59:30","","229-246","","","13086","","","","Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence","","","","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: AI Shell; DataBaker; Kriston AI; Magic Data; Arcadia; SpeechOcean ISSN: 0302-9743 Type: Proceedings Paper","","","","Confucian moral sentimentalism; Emotional intelligence; Empathy; Moral functionalism; Social robot","","Li, H; Ge, SS; Wu, Y; Wykowska, A; He, H; Liu, X; Li, D; PerezOsorio, J","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The framework enables the robot to react to external stimuli through a repertoire of expressive routines. The behavioral response framework is inspired by the simple reactive behaviors of organisms (e.g. reflexes) based on a bottom-up attention model. First, a participatory study for behavior elicitation was conducted. We explored the possible expressive behaviors of the robot and the possible stimuli trigger. These stimuli-response (S-R) pairs are designed befitting the robot's characteristics. Then, we developed a perception and a reactive behavior module that automatically translates any perceived stimulus into expressive behavioral responses. We evaluated the proposed S-R framework using Haru in an interaction setting and our results show an increase in human attention activity indicative of its positive impact to conveying the robot's sense of agency.","2021","2022-07-15 14:59:30","2022-07-15 14:59:30","","85-95","","","13086","","","","Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence","","","","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: AI Shell; DataBaker; Kriston AI; Magic Data; Arcadia; SpeechOcean ISSN: 0302-9743 Type: Proceedings Paper","","","","Human robot interaction; Social robot; Telepresence","","Li, H; Ge, SS; Wu, Y; Wykowska, A; He, H; Liu, X; Li, D; PerezOsorio, J","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design characteristics that influence the look and feel of the virtual assistant, such as visual appearance or language features, may significantly influence users' experience and engagement with the assistant. Objective: This scoping review aims to provide an overview of the experimental research examining how design characteristics of virtual health assistants affect user experience, summarize research findings of experimental research examining how design characteristics of virtual health assistants affect user experience, and provide recommendations for the design of virtual health assistants if sufficient evidence exists. Methods: We searched 5 electronic databases (Web of Science, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and ACM Digital Library) to identify the studies that used an experimental design to compare the effects of design characteristics between 2 or more versions of an interactive virtual health assistant on user experience among adults. Data were synthesized descriptively. Health domains, design characteristics, and outcomes were categorized, and descriptive statistics were used to summarize the body of research. Results for each study were categorized as positive, negative, or no effect, and a matrix of the design characteristics and outcome categories was constructed to summarize the findings. Results: The database searches identified 6879 articles after the removal of duplicates. We included 48 articles representing 45 unique studies in the review. The most common health domains were mental health and physical activity. Studies most commonly examined design characteristics in the categories of visual design or conversational style and relational behavior and assessed outcomes in the categories of personality, satisfaction, relationship, or use intention. Over half of the design characteristics were examined by only 1 study. Results suggest that empathy and relational behavior and self-disclosure are related to more positive user experience. Results also suggest that if a human-like avatar is used, realistic rendering and medical attire may potentially be related to more positive user experience; however, more research is needed to confirm this. Conclusions: There is a growing body of scientific evidence examining the impact of virtual health assistants' design characteristics on user experience. Taken together, data suggest that the look and feel of a virtual health assistant does affect user experience. Virtual health assistants that show empathy, display nonverbal relational behaviors, and disclose personal information about themselves achieve better user experience. At present, the evidence base is broad, and the studies are typically small in scale and highly heterogeneous. Further research, particularly using longitudinal research designs with repeated user interactions, is needed to inform the optimal design of virtual health assistants.","2021-12-21","2022-07-15 14:59:30","2022-07-15 14:59:30","","","","12","23","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 130 QUEENS QUAY E, STE 1102, TORONTO, ON M5A 0P6, CANADA Publisher: JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC Type: Review","","","","chatbot; conversational agent; design; digital health; eHealth; mobile phone; user experience; virtual assistant","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Communication, in this human-centric approach, is often understood as a process of successfully transmitting information in the form of predefined messages and gestures. This article introduces an alternative arts-led, movement-centric approach, which embraces the differences of machinelike robotic artefacts and, instead, investigates how meaning is dynamically enacted in the encounter of humans and machines. Our design approach revolves around a novel embodied mapping methodology, which serves to bridge between human-machine asymmetries and socioculturally situate abstract robotic artefacts. Building on concepts from performativity, material agency, enactive sense-making and kinaesthetic empathy, our Machine Movement Lab project opens up a performative-relational model of human-machine communication, where meaning is generated through relational dynamics in the interaction itself.","2022-06","2022-07-15 14:59:30","2022-07-15 14:59:30","","549-563","","2","37","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES Publisher: SPRINGER Type: Article","","","","Agency; Embodiment; Human-robot interaction; Meaning-making; Movement; Performance; Performativity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, sensor data from commercial wearables are prone to noise, missing, or artifacts. Even with the recent interest in deploying commercial wearables for long-term studies, there does not exist a standardized way to process the raw sensor data and researchers often use highly specific functions to preprocess, clean, normalize, and compute features. This leads to a lack of uniformity and reproducibility across different studies, making it difficult to compare results. To overcome these issues, we present FLIRT: A Feature Generation Toolkit for Wearable Data ; it is an open-source Python package that focuses on processing physiological data specifically from commercial wearables with all its challenges from data cleaning to feature extraction. Methods: FLIRT leverages a variety of state-of-the-art algorithms (e.g., particle filters, ML-based artifact detection) to ensure a robust preprocessing of physiological data from wearables. In a subsequent step, FLIRT utilizes a sliding-window approach and calculates a feature vector of more than 100 dimensions - a basis for a wide variety of ML algorithms. Results: We evaluated FLIRT on the publicly available WESAD dataset, which focuses on stress detection with an Empatica E4 wearable. Preprocessing the data with FLIRT ensures that unintended noise and artifacts are appropriately filtered. In the classification task, FLIRT outperforms the preprocessing baseline of the original WESAD paper. Conclusion: FLIRT provides functionalities beyond existing packages that can address unmet needs in physiological data processing and feature generation: (a) integrated handling of common wearable file formats (e.g., Empatica E4 archives), (b) robust preprocessing, and (c) standardized feature generation that ensures reproducibility of results. Nevertheless, while FLIRT comes with a default configuration to accommodate most situations, it offers a highly configurable interface for all of its implemented algorithms to account for specific needs.

Currently, this is mainly done by clinicians in a clinical setting, which is dependent on subjective self-reported input from patients. Existing classification apps also rely on self-reported information and lack validation. Therefore, the exploratory mBrain study investigates moving to continuous, semi-autonomous and objective follow-up and classification based on both self-reported and objective physiological and contextual data. Methods: The data collection set-up of the observational, longitudinal mBrain study involved physiological data from the Empatica E4 wearable, data-driven machine learning (ML) algorithms detecting activity, stress and sleep events from the wearables' data modalities, and a custom-made application to interact with these events and keep a diary of contextual and headache-specific data. A knowledge-based classification system for individual headache attacks was designed, focusing on migraine, cluster headache (CH) and tension-type headache (TTH) attacks, by using the classification criteria of ICHD-3. To show how headache and physiological data can be linked, a basic knowledge-based system for headache trigger detection is presented. Results: In two waves, 14 migraine and 4 CH patients participated (mean duration 22.3 days). 133 headache attacks were registered (98 by migraine, 35 by CH patients). Strictly applying ICHD-3 criteria leads to 8/98 migraine without aura and 0/35 CH classifications. Adapted versions yield 28/98 migraine without aura and 17/35 CH classifications, with 12/18 participants having mostly diagnosis classifications when episodic TTH classifications (57/98 and 32/35) are ignored. Conclusions: Strictly applying the ICHD-3 criteria on individual attacks does not yield good classification results. Adapted versions yield better results, with the mostly classified phenotype (migraine without aura vs. CH) matching the diagnosis for 12/18 patients. The absolute number of migraine without aura and CH classifications is, however, rather low. Example cases can be identified where activity and stress events explain patient-reported headache triggers. Continuous improvement of the data collection protocol, ML algorithms, and headache classification criteria (including the investigation of integrating physiological data), will further improve future headache follow-up, classification and trigger detection.","2022-03-31","2022-07-15 14:59:30","2022-07-15 14:59:30","","","","1","22","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND Publisher: BMC Type: Article","","","","Context-aware; Continuous headache follow-up; Headache classification; Headache trigger detection; Knowledge-based; Machine learning; Mobile application; Physiological wearable data; Primary headache disorder; Semantics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Aim: To obtain the perceptions of participants on project-based learning in the subject of Pharmacology during COVID-19 lockdown. Materials and Methods: This was an online questionnaire-based descriptive study done on the Google platform. A series of integrated lectures were conducted in the Department of Pharmacology and Internal Medicine on diabetes, lipid dysfunction and thyroid disorder for second year MBBS students. The study was conducted from August to November 2020 in a medical college in Kerala, India. Google-based project submission was done after identifying a patient at home or neighbourhood with the disease covered after each integrated lecture. A validated questionnaire was used to obtain feedback about the project-based learning on a Likert scale. Statistical analysis was done using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) Version 16 software for Windows. Results: The response rate was 76.9% (100 out of 130). The majority of the participants agreed/totally agreed to statements on professional attributes attained during project-based learning session like the ability to think creatively (60%), make observations (71%), compile information (80%), assess and make a decision (59%), analyse situations of professional practice (65%), develop oral communication skills (57%), develop Self-Directed Learning (SDL) (70%), develop skills needed for professional practice (54%), develop empathy towards patients with disease (79%) and develop self-confidence in learning the subject (63%) with a median score of 4. The majority of participants agreed/totally agreed to the effectiveness of the project-based learning in helping acquire various clinical and theoretical competencies during COVID-19 lockdown. The majority of the participants and the patient identified at home were happy to be part of the project-based learning.

As a result, realistic life size artificial companions are becoming more affordable to purchase and more feasible to patronize on a service basis. Sexual relations may be without equal when it comes to emotional intimacy. Yet, the increasingly vocal and interactive robotic versions of these dolls, feel nothing. They may nevertheless induce emotions in users that potentially surpass the pleasure of human-human sexual experiences. The most technologically advanced love and sex robots are forecast to sense human emotions and gear their performances of empathy, conversation, and sexual activity accordingly. I offer a model of how this might be done to provide a better service experience. I compare the nature of resulting “artificial emotions” by robots to natural emotions by humans. I explore the ethical issues entailed in offering love and sex robot services with artificial emotions and offer a conclusion and recommendations for service management and for further research.","","2022-07-15 14:59:30","2022-07-15 14:59:30","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 2455 ℡LER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA Publisher: SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC Type: Article; Early Access","","","","dolls; ethics; individual service optimization; intimacy; robots; sex; social acceptance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Moreover, equipping an artificial agent to infer beliefs may improve the collaboration between humans and machines in several ways. In this article, we propose a hybrid cognitive architecture, called Thrive, with the purpose of unifying in a computational model recent discoveries regarding the underlying mechanism involved in trust. The model is based on biological observations that confirmed the role of the midbrain in trial-and-error learning, and on developmental studies that indicate how essential is a theory of mind in order to build empathetic trust. Thrive is build on top of an actor-critic framework that is used to stabilize the weights of two self-organizing maps. A Bayesian network embeds prior knowledge into an intrinsic environment, providing a measure of cost that is used to boostrap learning without an external reward signal. Following a developmental robotics approach, we embodied the model in the iCub humanoid robot and we replicated two psychological experiments. The results are in line with real data, and shed some light on the mechanisms involved in trust-based learning in children and robots.","2022-03","2022-07-15 14:59:30","2022-07-15 14:59:30","","1947-1959","","3","52","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA Publisher: IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC Type: Article","","","","Actor-critic; Bayesian networks (BNs); cognitive architecture; intrinsically motivated reinforcement learning (IMRL); theory of mind (ToM); trust","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It was also the application that led to the creation of FAtiMA, an affective agent architecture for creating autonomous characters that can evoke empathic responses. In this article, we describe the FAtiMA Toolkit, a collection of open-source tools that is designed to help researchers, game developers, and roboticists incorporate a computational model of emotion and decision-making in their work. The toolkit was developed with the goal of making FAtiMA more accessible, easier to incorporate into different projects, and more flexible in its capabilities for human-agent interaction, based upon the experience gathered over the years across different virtual environments and human-robot interaction scenarios. As a result, this work makes several different contributions to the field of Agent-Based Architectures. More precisely, the FAtiMA Toolkit's library-based design allows developers to easily integrate it with other frameworks, its meta-cognitive model affords different internal reasoners and affective components, and its explicit dialogue structure gives control to the author even within highly complex scenarios. To demonstrate the use of the FAtiMA Toolkit, several different use cases where the toolkit was successfully applied are described and discussed.","2022-03","2022-07-15 14:59:30","2022-07-15 14:59:30","","","","1","12","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY USA Publisher: ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY Type: Article","","","","affective computing; cognitive architecture; Embodied agents; emotions; social robots","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For this study, we used a new approach with project-based learning to go beyond the typical environment in higher education and bring solutions to real-life scenarios. The project was developed with undergraduate engineering students in collaboration with a rehabilitation institute in Mexico City to design a physical therapy routine using the NAO robot. It allowed interaction between young patients in real time and fostered empathy while developing a final usable product. The study measured the usability of the robotic platform during the rehabilitation sessions and the reproducibility of the project through Cronbach's alpha evaluation. The usability results show a higher interest in the project from both the patients and the medical staff involved while constructing the material needed to develop a product that matches the standards given by the rehabilitation institute. Implications for practice or policy: center dot Therapists could change traditional approaches to caregiving while adopting new technological methodologies using robots. center dot Higher education students could supplement their school curricula with real-case scenarios such as creating innovative therapy sessions for people with physical disabilities. center dot Schools might need to collaborate with a wide range of institutions to provide technological solutions to real problems.","2021","2022-07-15 14:59:31","2022-07-15 14:59:31","","32-42","","5","37","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: UNIT 5, 202 COODE ST, PO BOX 350, TUGUN, 4224, AUSTRALIA Publisher: AUSTRALASIAN SOC COMPUTERS LEARNING TERTIARY EDUCATION-ASCILITE Type: Article","","","","educational innovation; higher education; physical therapy; project-based learning; social robotics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An agent could leverage an understanding of such implicit human feedback to improve its task performance at no cost to the human. This approach contrasts with common agent teaching methods based on demonstrations, critiques, or other guidance that need to be attentively and intentionally provided. In this work, we demonstrate a novel data-driven framework for learning from implicit human feedback, EMPATHIC. This two-stage method consists of (1) mapping implicit human feedback to relevant task statistics such as rewards, optimality, and advantage; and (2) using such a mapping to learn a task. We instantiate the first stage and three second-stage evaluations of the learned mapping. To do so, we collect a dataset of human facial reactions while participants observe an agent execute a sub-optimal policy for a prescribed training task. We train a deep neural network on this data and demonstrate its ability to (1) infer relative reward ranking of events in the training task from prerecorded human facial reactions; (2) improve the policy of an agent in the training task using live human facial reactions; and (3) transfer to a novel domain in which it evaluates robot manipulation trajectories.

The emerging challenge now is the selection of most discriminative information from high-dimensional data collected from multiple sources. The available fusion algorithms with their complex structure are poorly adopted to the computationally constrained environment which requires integrating information directly at the source. As a result, more simple low-level fusion methods are needed. Objective: In the absence of a data combining process, the cost of directly applying high-dimensional raw data to a deep classifier would be computationally expensive with regard to the response time, energy consumption, and memory requirement. Taking this into account, we aimed to develop a data fusion technique in a computationally efficient way to achieve a more comprehensive insight of human activity dynamics in a lower dimension. The major objective was considering statistical dependency of multisensory data and exploring intermodality correlation patterns for different activities. Methods: In this technique, the information in time (regardless of the number of sources) is transformed into a 2D space that facilitates classification of eating episodes from others. This is based on a hypothesis that data captured by various sensors are statistically associated with each other and the covariance matrix of all these signals has a unique distribution correlated with each activity which can be encoded on a contour representation. These representations are then used as input of a deep model to learn specific patterns associated with specific activity. Results: In order to show the generalizability of the proposed fusion algorithm, 2 different scenarios were taken into account. These scenarios were different in terms of temporal segment size, type of activity, wearable device, subjects, and deep learning architecture. The first scenario used a data set in which a single participant performed a limited number of activities while wearing the Empatica E4 wristband. In the second scenario, a data set related to the activities of daily living was used where 10 different participants wore inertial measurement units while performing a more complex set of activities. The precision metric obtained from leave-one-subject-out cross-validation for the second scenario reached 0.803. The impact of missing data on performance degradation was also evaluated. Conclusions: To conclude, the proposed fusion technique provides the possibility of embedding joint variability information over different modalities in just a single 2D representation which results in obtaining a more global view of different aspects of daily human activities at hand, and yet preserving the desired performance level in activity recognition.","2021-01-28","2022-07-15 14:59:31","2022-07-15 14:59:31","","","","1","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Place: 130 QUEENS QUAY E, STE 1102, TORONTO, ON M5A 0P6, CANADA Publisher: JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC Type: Article","","","","covariance distribution; data fusion; deep learning; food intake episode; image processing; wearable sensors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For this reason, designers in industrialised countries are required to create more innovative products/services whose novelty does not depend on their own original technology alone but on flexible resource integration among diverse actors. In order to design innovative products/services, empathy must be developed among diverse actors around the premise of the design. However, the ways to understand rationalities of each other is still unclear in extant research. As a result, diverse actors with heterogeneous rationalities fail to empathise to others, and designing innovative products/services as intended is difficult. To address this issue, this study aims to develop a practical method that achieve to understand the rationality of other actor in design innovative products/services. To achieve this, a context analysis method is proposed that captures the other actor's context in formalised procedure. The proposed method includes four steps: conducting an interview to extract information of context, modelling the context, understanding the context and carrying out the depth interview to understand a target actor's rationality completely based on the context modelling result. The proposed method was applied to therapy robot development, which is in its early stage of innovative service design. Moreover, the application result can encourage an actor to understand the other actor's rationality by utilising the proposed method.","2021","2022-07-15 14:59:31","2022-07-15 14:59:31","","","","2","15","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Backup Publisher: Japan Soc Mech Engineers, Design & Syst Div; Japan Soc Mech Engineers, Mfg Syst Div; Japan Soc Mech Engineers Place: KDX Iidabashi Square Bldg, 2nd Floor, 4-1 Shin-ogawamachi, Shinjuku-ku, TOKYO, 162-0814, JAPAN Publisher: JAPAN SOC MECHANICAL ENGINEERS Type: Article; Proceedings Paper","","","","Co-creation; Co-creative innovation; Context analysis; Context modelling; Design rationale; Empathy; Synthesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Prior research in computational empathy has focused on designing empathic agents that use verbal and nonverbal behaviors to simulate empathy and attempt to elicit empathic responses from humans. The challenge of developing agents with the ability to automatically perceive elicited empathy in humans remains largely unexplored. Our paper presents the first approach to modeling user empathy elicited during interactions with a robotic agent. We collected a new dataset from the novel interaction context of participants listening to a robot storyteller (46 participants, 6.9 hours of video). After each storytelling interaction, participants answered a questionnaire that assessed their level of elicited empathy during the interaction with the robot. We conducted experiments with 8 classical machine learning models and 2 deep learning models (long short-term memory networks and temporal convolutional networks) to detect empathy by leveraging patterns in participants’ visual behaviors while they were listening to the robot storyteller. Our highest-performing approach, based on XGBoost, achieved an accuracy of 69% and AUC of 72% when detecting empathy in videos. We contribute insights regarding modeling approaches and visual features for automated empathy detection. Our research informs and motivates future development of empathy perception models that can be leveraged by virtual and robotic agents during human-machine interactions.","2021-09","2022-07-15 15:05:55","2022-07-15 15:05:55","","1-8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ISSN: 2156-8111","","","","affective computing; Affective computing; computational empathy; Computational modeling; Deep learning; Feature extraction; human-robot interaction; Man-machine systems; Robots; Visualization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It has been argued that empathy has a strong effect on behavior inducement. In human-human interaction, it has been verified that the influence of a nonverbal cue on empathy outweighs that of a verbal cue when those are used in a combined way. The objectives of this study are to explore if such outweighing effect of nonverbal cues is maintained in human-robot interaction (HRI) and to investigate the mechanism of communication cues’ effects by analyzing the mediation structure with the following mediator variables: perceived emotion, perceived intentionality, perceived malfunction, and empathy inducement. To this end, we conducted 2 (verbal type: positive verbal cue vs. negative verbal cue) × 2 (nonverbal type: positive nonverbal cue vs. negative nonverbal cue) within-participant experiment (N = 48). The experiment created a situation in which the social robot was harshly criticized during a conversation. The analysis of experiment results showed the outweighing effect of a nonverbal cue was maintained. When a nonverbal cue conveyed a negative, situation-accordant emotion, it had a decisive effect on perceived emotion, empathy, and behavior inducement. In contrast, a verbal cue induced participants’ empathy and behavior when it conveyed a positive, situation-discordant emotion. This inconsistency between verbal cue and nonverbal cue made the combination of positive verbal cue and negative nonverbal cue have the strongest effect. It implies that participants had different expectations for each of the two communication cues, just as they did in social interactions with human beings. It implies that participants might have applied normative expectations for social interaction with human beings to the social robot.","2021-09","2022-07-15 15:05:55","2022-07-15 15:05:55","","854-861","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ISSN: 2153-0866","","","","Copper; Human-robot interaction; Intelligent robots; Mediation; Robots","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Due to the open challenge in finding perfect Bayesian equilibria of such games, existing studies often decouple the belief and physical dynamics by iterating between belief update and motion planning. Importantly, the robot’s reward parameters are often assumed to be known to the humans, in order to simplify the computation. We show in this paper that under this simplification, the robot performs non-empathetic belief update about the humans’ parameters, which causes high safety risks in uncontrolled intersection scenarios. In contrast, we propose a model for empathetic belief update, where the agent updates the joint probabilities of all agents’ parameter combinations. The update uses a neural network that approximates the Nash equilibrial action-values of agents. We compare empathetic and non-empathetic belief update methods on a two-vehicle uncontrolled intersection case with short reaction time. Results show that when both agents are unknowingly aggressive (or non-aggressive), empathy is necessary for avoiding collisions when agents have false believes about each others’ parameters.

Previous research has established that anthropomorphism can significantly affect subjective perceptions of, and interactions with, machines. Furthermore, the ability to customize digital tools has been shown to affect user preferences, video game enjoyment, and the efficacy of digital mental health interventions. This study examined whether the customization of a machine teammate could influence the performance of the human-machine team and generate an affective response on the part of the human teammate. To evaluate this premise, we developed a bomb-defusing task simulation using the Unity game engine wherein participants were randomly assigned to one of two (humanlike or machinelike) robot avatars or were given the ability to customize one. The customizable robot avatar allows the participant to select either a humanlike or machinelike robot and customize the color of the wheels and casing. The customization is aesthetic in nature and has no effect on the functionality of the robot. The game design incorporates a high-risk environment and uncertainty with respect to the bomb-defusing distance and required button presses to encourage cautious guidance of the robot. We predicted that the ability to customize the robot will increase performance and subjective measures of trust, affect, attachment, identification, immersion, and control. We also predicted that the humanlikeness of the robot would increase performance and our subjective measures. Finally, we expected to see a significant effect of customization and humanlikeness such that the customization and humanlikeness have an additive effect on performance and our subjective measures. The results of all analyses were nonsignificant. These results may help inform the design of such systems and address fears that customization could lead to over-empathizing with a machine teammate in a way that would reduce use in high-risk environments.","2022-04","2022-07-15 15:05:55","2022-07-15 15:05:55","","403-408","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","affect; Avatars; customisation; Games; humanlikeness; Mobile robots; Power measurement; Presses; trust; Uncertainty; Wheels","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the second phase, we developed an online learning scheme for naive users to personalize their robot further, building on top of the bootstrapped model. Here, we developed a natural user interface that enables natural human-robot interaction via the suite of sensors that allows the users to provide evaluative feedback during the interaction with the robot. We evaluated the system and our results show that bootstrapping is an efficient tool to hasten the robot’s learning while online learning provided some form of personalization in the real environment with naive users.","2021-08","2022-07-15 15:05:56","2022-07-15 15:05:56","","989-996","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ISSN: 1944-9437","","","","Buildings; Graphical user interfaces; Human-robot interaction; Robot sensing systems; Sensors; Tools; Training","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Inspired by developmental robotics theory, EMRES has an internal state and a mood, which contribute in the evolution of the flow of emotions; at every episode, the next emotional state of the agent is affected by its internal state, mood, current emotion, and the expression read in the human partner. As a result, EMRES does not imitate, but it synchronizes to the emotion expressed by the human companion. The agent has been trained to recognize expressive faces of the FER2013 database and it is capable of achieving 78.3% performance with wild images.

The neurotransmitter dopamine is produced by nerve cells in the complicated body part, and it is responsible for conveying messages that plan and govern bodily action. In certain people, the dopamine-producing nerve cells in the nucleus niger begin to migrate away. PD symptoms such as trembling, weak muscles, stiffness, and balance issues appear after 80% of dopamine is eliminated. Detection of PD from rapidly given cues, like as speech and handwriting, is crucial to various social behaviors, including as fast imitation and empathy. With technological improvements and, as a result, the prominence of audio collecting devices in everyday life, dependable models that transform audio data into a screening aid for healthcare providers might possibly deliver diagnoses that are both cheaper and more accurate. This experiment uses two modalities to identify Parkinson's disease. Voice and handwriting are the two modalities. Audio processing and machine learning methods in Matlab are used to identify PD via speech. The characteristics are derived from the audio of people with Parkinson's disease who have a local binary pattern. For classification, machine learning techniques are utilized. Machine learning classifiers are used in the classification process using neural networks, and embedded systems are used to identify PD via handwriting. The microcontroller is used to see the disease with the help of a gyroscope sensor. The principle of angle measurement is determined by calculating the angle of free vibration of the hanging mass with respect to the gyroscope casing. As a result, if the vibration passed the edge, the person is suffering from this disease.","2022-03","2022-07-15 15:05:56","2022-07-15 15:05:56","","1-4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","audio processing; disorder; Feature extraction; gyroscope; Gyroscopes; hand tremor; Machine learning; machine learning classifier; Neurons; Parkinson's disease; Real-time systems; vibration; Vibrations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The complete presentation was not made available for publicationWith the dawn of digital technologies, we are in the early stages of significant changes leading us into the age of “Systems.” The machine age, which has the industrial revolution as its counterpart, is now giving way to the “Systems Age,” having automation and AI as its technological counterparts. “The Rise of the Robots” and Machine Learning technologies are causing unemployment so much so in about thirty years, half of the world population will be out of jobs. As one computer scientist put it, “We are approaching a time when machines will be able to outperform humans at almost any task. I believe that society needs to confront this question before it is upon us: if machines are capable of doing almost any work humans can do, what will humans do?” In the years to come, life could be absolute leisure with no work, and this could be the death knell for human survival, particularly if the developing technology is not kept as a good servant. These sentiments were echoed when Stephan Hawking had said that AI, if left unchecked, “could spell the end of the human race”. Elon Musk also sounded that future advancement in AI could be akin to “we are summoning the demon”. In order to understand the revolution, we are experiencing; we need to look more closely at the concepts, ideas, and philosophies that are shaping the evolving worldview. This needs a shift in our thinking that is required as the world unfolds around us in a system's age. As we move into the system's age, we need to supplement our high-tech abilities with thinking abilities that are high concept (systemic ideas, detecting patterns, creativity) and high touch (empathize, purpose and meaning). This talk highlights such thinking approaches that will make us understand the world in front of us, shape it, and thrive as it unfolds.","2021-11","2022-07-15 15:05:56","2022-07-15 15:05:56","","xv-xvi","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Shape; Sociology; Software quality; Statistics; Task analysis; Telecommunications; Unemployment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Also, negative emotions such as anger, shame, and anxiety usually arise from stress, and it is referring to destructive and threatening to show a relationship between them. Therefore, research on recognizing emotions is still an important issue currently. Fifteen males university students have participated in this study. A fingertip photoplethysmograph (PPG) was used to record the heart rate variable. This study used The International Affective Picture System (IAPS) to induce particular emotions. As a subjective evaluation, we employed Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM) to evaluate the subject's emotions. Then, we compared the SAM evaluation to their heart rate properties for further investigation. The FIR Band Pass Filter was established as a pre-processing method, and a single feature was extracted from a PPG recording called Heart Rate Changes (HCR). Instead of utilizing artificial intelligence or other machine learning classification techniques, we performed if-else classification to recognize negative and positive emotions as basic emotions. We found that the HCR was significantly different between the positive and negative emotions (p<0.0001). We achieved ± 50% of accuracy while classifying the two basic emotions. We validated the results by implementing a real-time scheme detection based on a low-cost device and display it on a user-built application. Current results need improvement in future studies. We concluded that a single feature without any advanced methods is still a promising approach for real-time detection. The system was also reliable in future applications on low-cost device development.","2021-11","2022-07-15 15:05:56","2022-07-15 15:05:56","","224-229","","","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ISSN: 2189-8723","","","","Education; Emotion recognition; Emotions; Feature extraction; Finite impulse response filters; Heart rate; Heart rate changes; Low-cost device; Machine learning; Real-time systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

First, humans do not consistently agree on what is or is not ethical. Second, contemporary AI and machine learning methods tend to be blunt instruments which either search for solutions within the bounds of predefined rules or mimic behavior. An ethical AI must be capable of inferring unspoken rules, interpreting nuance and context, possess and be able to infer intent, and explain not just its actions but its intent. Using enactivism, semiotics, perceptual symbol systems, and symbol emergence, we specify an agent that learns not just arbitrary relations between signs but their meaning in terms of the perceptual states of its sensorimotor system. Subsequently it can learn what is meant by a sentence and infer the intent of others in terms of its own experiences. It has malleable intent because the meaning of symbols changes as it learns, and its intent is represented symbolically as a goal. As such it may learn a concept of what is most likely to be considered ethical by the majority within a population of humans, which may then be used as a goal. The meaning of abstract symbols is expressed using perceptual symbols of raw, multimodal sensorimotor stimuli as the weakest (consistent with Ockham’s Razor) necessary and sufficient concept, an intensional definition learned from an ostensive definition, from which the extensional definition or category of all ethical decisions may be obtained. Because these abstract symbols are the same for both situation and response, the same symbol is used when either performing or observing an action. This is akin to mirror neurons in the human brain. Mirror symbols may allow the agent to empathize, because its own experiences are associated with the symbol, which is also associated with the observation of another agent experiencing something that symbol represents.","2022-06","2022-07-15 15:05:56","2022-07-15 15:05:56","","292-300","","2","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Artificial intelligence; Artificial intelligence (AI) robotics; empathetic AI; enactivism; ethical AI; Ethics; Mirrors; Monitoring; Sociology; Statistics; symbol emergence; Vehicles","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Being well means being physically and mentally healthy. Additionally, feeling empowered is also a component of well-being. Recently, self-tracking has been proposed as means to achieve increased awareness, thus, giving the opportunity to identify and decrease undesired behaviours. However, inappropriately communicated self-tracking results might cause the opposite effect. To address this, a subtle self-tracking feedback by mirroring the self's state into an embodied artificial agent has been proposed. By eliciting empathy towards the artificial agent and fostering helping behaviours, users would help themselves as well. We searched the literature to find supporting or opposing evidence for the robot mirroring framework. The results showed an increasing interest in self-tracking technologies for well-being management. Current discussions disseminate what can be achieved with different levels of automation; the type and relevance of feedback; and the role that artificial agents, such as chatbots and robots, might play to support people's therapies. These findings support further development of the robot mirroring framework to improve medical, hedonic, and eudaemonic well-being.","2021-09","2022-07-15 15:05:56","2022-07-15 15:05:56","","1-7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Affective computing; Automation; chatbots; Chatbots; Conferences; empathy; Medical treatment; robotics; Robots; self-quantification; well-being","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In fact, several activities during social interaction, such as appropriate feedback, turn-taking, coordination with peers, and even empathy and engagement exhibition directly depend on it. One of the aspects of cognitive malfunctioning in children with Autistic Spectrum Disorders is time perception deficit. Learning to pay attention to and correctly assess timing is thus a critical first step to improve social skills for children with Autism. In this paper, we present a novel sensing system and algorithm for estimating a subject's rhythmic motion timing from visual information using Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) coupled with FFT. This system will enable a robot saxophonist to estimate the rhythmic period from a child's motion during a robot-based music therapy session. Fast-Fourier- Transform (FFT) is an algorithm widely applied in rhythmic body movement detection, due to advantages such low computation and easy integration. However, long transient time delay is a critical limitation, reducing the correct motion timing estimation during period transitions. The novel system presented in this article is shown to significantly reduce transient time delay. The results of both a simulation and an evaluation experiment show that, compared with FFT processing alone, this algorithm gives a better performance due to its smaller average offset error and shorter transient time delay, allowing a more precise assessment of the child's synchronization response.","2021-07","2022-07-15 15:05:56","2022-07-15 15:05:56","","72-77","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ISSN: 2162-7576","","","","Autism Spectrum Disorder; Delay effects; Human-robot-interaction; Long Short-Term Memory; Medical treatment; Music therapy; Recurrent Neural Network; Recurrent neural networks; Robot kinematics; Robot sensing systems; Transforms; Visualization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Games that use virtual agents/characters don't consider these inherent defects of mirroring dysfunction of children with ASD and hence are not effective for training autistic children's social communication skills. In this paper, an intervention tool based on serious games is designed for children with ASD to train their social communication skills. By avatarizing the autistic child who is undergoing intervention in the game scenarios, they can intuitively see themselves participating in the virtual social communication situations created by the game and produce psychological hints of “I should do or say this under this situation”. We hope that this avatar-based intervention tool helps children with ASD overcome the dysfunction of the mirror neuron system and improve their social communication skills.","2021-12","2022-07-15 15:05:56","2022-07-15 15:05:56","","299-303","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ISSN: 2166-0549","","","","Autism; autism spectrum disorder; avatar; Games; intervention; Neurons; Psychology; serious game; Serious games; social communication skills; Technological innovation; Training","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Current works in this domain do not explicitly consider the influence of contextual information fusion based on correlation coefficient and memory network with branch structure for sentiment analysis. Unlike present works, this article presents a hierarchical self-attention fusion (H-SATF) model for capturing contextual information better among utterances, a contextual self-attention temporal convolutional network (CSAT-TCN) for sentiment recognition in the social Internet of Things, and a multibranch memory (MBM) network that stores self-speaker and interspeaker sentimental states into global memories.

Intelligence and adaptivity in the vehicle context address the three main goals: Increasing safety, usability and empathy in vehicle systems. Adaptivity of systems can be evaluated by considering the technical system features, user-interface-related features and the actual user experience of the adaptive system. We provide an overview of classifications for adaptive systems including the Levels of Adaptive Sensitive Responses (LASR). The levels differentiate the input that a system considers in its operations to adapt to user groups or to the individual user. Along with that, we propose User Experience (UX) design guidelines applicable to the different levels. In an online survey, we varied LASR and one of the UX design guidelines, namely transparency. The within-subjects study showed that both, the levels and the variation of transparency, influenced the perception of intelligence, transparency and intuitive design. However, a significant proportion of users did not understand the difference between the two LASR versions, indicating that users build mental models of systems that imply more personal data usage than the system actually employs. The LASR framework allowed this differentiation to be revealed in system performance and user perception. More research is necessary to elaborate the correlation between levels of adaptivity, UX design, specific UX design guidelines and user experience measures.","2022-05","2022-07-15 15:05:56","2022-07-15 15:05:56","","4866-4876","","5","23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Adaptive algorithms; adaptive systems; Adaptive systems; affective computing; Automation; Automobiles; human–computer interaction; Intelligent systems; intelligent vehicles; interactive systems; road vehicles; Task analysis; User experience; user interfaces; Vehicles","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Telecommuting has positive effects not only on expenses but also on productivity, work flexibility and quality of work. The adoption rate of telecommuting has gone exponentially high especially due to government policies such as social distancing and country-wide lockdown measures. Human resource managers over the globe have reported higher empathy, increased co-ordination, retention and engagement during the lockdown. Provided that, very minimal percentage of workforce operated from their home prior to the coronavirus, it is difficult for employees to adopt the proposed model without any prior training and guidance. This research paper aims to shed light on how the pandemic has impacted the way we work, concerns related to human resource management with main focus on training and development function of HR department. The paper also proposes a framework for training employees to adapt to telecommuting as well as back to office conduct through technological interventions such as Virtual Reality, Artificial Intelligence etc. The overall theoretical framework provides a basic training and development process to reskill and upskill the employees to combat the perennial skill shortages post pandemic.","2021-04","2022-07-15 15:05:56","2022-07-15 15:05:56","","171-176","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Artificial Intelligence; COVID-19; Organizations; Pandemic; Pandemics; Reskill and upskill; Solid modeling; Telecommuting; Teleworking; Training; Training and development; Virtual reality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While a lot of research is being carried out to push such technical endeavour, we notice a considerable gap in human centred features more specifically empathetic and emotive skills and the consideration of such soft skills in incoming new generation of industry. Such soft skills are revised by trans-disciplinary fields i.e., Feeling economy and can be applied and harmonised with the current Smart industry conception.

The results of experiments are encouraging but show that significant research and development efforts are necessary to reach the practical usefulness of AI. We discuss that chaining multiple LMs might be needed to filter or post-process the results.

Moreover, equipping an artificial agent to infer beliefs may improve the collaboration between humans and machines in several ways. In this article, we propose a hybrid cognitive architecture, called Thrive, with the purpose of unifying in a computational model recent discoveries regarding the underlying mechanism involved in trust. The model is based on biological observations that confirmed the role of the midbrain in trial-and-error learning, and on developmental studies that indicate how essential is a theory of mind in order to build empathetic trust. Thrive is build on top of an actor–critic framework that is used to stabilize the weights of two self-organizing maps. A Bayesian network embeds prior knowledge into an intrinsic environment, providing a measure of cost that is used to boostrap learning without an external reward signal. Following a developmental robotics approach, we embodied the model in the iCub humanoid robot and we replicated two psychological experiments. The results are in line with real data, and shed some light on the mechanisms involved in trust-based learning in children and robots.","2022-03","2022-07-15 15:05:56","2022-07-15 15:05:56","","1947-1959","","3","52","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Actor-critic; Bayesian networks (BNs); Biological system modeling; Brain modeling; cognitive architecture; Computational modeling; Games; Humanoid robots; intrinsically motivated reinforcement learning (IMRL); theory of mind (ToM); trust","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this study is to detect stress resulted from these factors in a way that causes the least discomfort to the person. It is quite common to use physiological data such as heart rate, electromyography (EMG), electrocardiography (ECG), electroencephalography (EEG), respiration and skin conductivity to detect when a person is exposed to stress. In this study, stress estimation was made using blood volume pulse (BVP) and electrodermal activity (EDA) sensor data obtained from the Empatica E4 device in the open source WESAD dataset. With the use of BVP and EDA sensors, the intervention to the person has been tried to be minimized. Thus, the model ans sensor method proposed in this study can be easily adapted to daily life. For stress detection, a feed forward deep learning artificial neural network (ANN) technique is proposed by using the baseline and stress labeled data in the dataset. With ANN model, %96.26 accuracy was obtained and a fairly smooth loss curve was observed. This model was compared with the ANN methods in previous studies.","2022-06","2022-07-15 15:05:56","2022-07-15 15:05:56","","1-7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Adaptation models; Anxiety disorders; artificial neural network; Artificial neural networks; Brain modeling; BVP; Deep learning; EDA; Electrocardiography; physiological signal; Robot sensing systems; Stress detection; WESAD","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To this end, with reference to the Theory of Implicit Interaction, this paper rethinks the application and experience effect of active interactive feedback in community settings. Based on the differences in experience arising from the non-verbal feedback of intelligent devices, this paper studies the differences in user experience as a result of different active interaction behaviors such as head movements and body movements in the course of unified and coordinated work between intelligent devices and people. By probing into the differences of user experience from three points of view, i.e., the attraction of movements, empathy of movements, and communication of the sense of trust, we analyzed and summarized the key factors that affect user experience. Furthermore, we verified that the association tightness of interaction behaviors is essential to user experience during human-intelligent robot interaction.","2021-05","2022-07-15 15:05:56","2022-07-15 15:05:56","","43-50","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Active Interaction; Collaboration; Human-machine Interaction Human-intelligence Coordination; Implicit Interaction; Intelligent vehicles; Magnetic heads; Media; Robot kinematics; Robot sensing systems; User experience; User Experience","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
