(considering our need for more empathy in and around the design and planning of the street ecology, we need to recognize that autonomous robotic vehicles are by definition, lacking empathy. or to put it another way, the act of caring will need to be programmed into our streets if we are to achieve our goals for empathy, equity, and justice. if you think about a driver getting into a car now—the protection the steel frame—the power and strength the car offers the driver, it literally makes the driver less empathetic. so applying that concept to avs who have no ability to empathize to begin with, we need to start programming empathy into the avs or else it will function like a robot—taking over the street with indifference. so we have to ask, how do we program empathy? if you needed to make an object empathetic, what is the first thing you would tell it? probably you would tell it to feel. how do you tell a robot to feel? feelings cannot be programmed. can you legitimately create rules, and then prioritize one rule over another. and do you prioritize the safety of the pedestrian over the safety of the passenger? it seems to almost all rules have to should prioritize the humanity of the street ecology first, and then the driver/passenger. would the car companies let this happen? we have our work cut out) much depends on what and how we value and prioritize how we measure things, how we understand these measures, and then how we act in response to realize the sustainability, livability, and equity promises of our streets, communities and regions. for this, we need to examine and understand our guiding principles and goals, and this other dimension of performance (speed, volume, access, place) before engaging in processes to develop plans and designs to create livable and complete streets and communities, as discussed in the following chapters of part iii—realizing the promise of our streets.",2021,2021-05-19T13:19:57Z,2021-05-19T13:19:57Z,NA,307-333,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Elsevier,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,DOI: 10.1016/B978-0-12-816028-2.00018-6,NA,NA,NA,Empathy; Agents; Actors; Bicycling; Equity; Ethical livability; Human rights to the street; Humanity; Justice; Livability ethics; Stewards; Walking,NA,"Bruce; Appleyard, Donald",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

phénomène psychique, l’« auto-empathie », tel qu’il est mis en œuvre dans le contexte des espaces numériques et singulièrement dans la situation du joueur qui incarne un avatar (une figure de pixel) dans un jeu vidéo. méthode dans la perspective d’une ouverture théorique à la fois phénoménologique et psychanalytique, l’auto-empathie est le processus au cours duquel, en prenant la position de l’« autrui-en-soi », nous nous représentons notre monde subjectif – soit l’ensemble de nos états de subjectivité (actions, émotions, pensées) –, par relation empathique avec nous-mêmes. cette relation d’auto-empathie correspond à une opération de distanciation, et d’appropriation symbolique, au cours de laquelle nous nous dédoublons, en mettant en œuvre notre faculté innée d’être à la fois sujet et objet pour nous-mêmes. résultats la médiatisation de l’auto-empathie dans les mondes numériques permet de nous mettre à la place d’une figure qui nous représente – notre avatar –, de sorte que notre empathie est tournée vers nous-mêmes indirectement. ce second temps d’empathie pour une figure virtuelle de soi, nommé « auto-empathie médiatisée » ou « auto-empathie virtuelle », favoriserait dans un troisième temps le développement d’une empathie pour soi. enfin, le développement d’une empathie pour autrui serait soutenu dans un quatrième temps, par l’attention que les joueurs se portent les uns aux autres dans les jeux en réseau. discussion ces quatre hypothèses, illustrées par des cas cliniques, ouvrent une interrogation portant sur le cadre en psychanalyse. à l’adolescence, le travail de virtualisation, qui consiste en l’anticipation créatrice de ses possibilités subjectives, apparaît régulièrement contrarié. la duplicité psychique n’est plus à même d’opérer une distance symbolisante entre le soi réel et le soi virtuel, entre le soi subjectif et le soi subjectivant. l’autrui-en-soi est inefficace à proposer à l’adolescence un dialogue empathique avec soi-même. en conséquence, l’autoreprésentation flirte avec l’effondrement, en particulier dans les états de cassures subjectives. or, les espaces numériques pourraient bien être pour l’adolescent des supports indirects d’appropriation d’expériences subjectives. conclusion nos réflexions ont conduit à penser l’auto-empathie comme la réalisation de l’autrui-en-soi qui permet de nous représenter notre propre monde subjectif. l’auto-empathie médiatisée par un avatar peut donc être décrite comme une représentation par empathie de notre part subjective contenue par ce personnage. dès lors, l’espace du jeu vidéo se présente comme un espace de subjectivation. objectives the authors propose to explore a psychic phenomenon, the “auto-empathy”, as implemented in the context of digital spaces and particularly in the situation of the player who embodies an avatar (a pixel figure) in a video game. method from the perspective of a theoretical opening both phenomenological and psychoanalytic, auto-empathy is the process in which, taking the position of the “other-in-oneself”, we represent our subjective world – or the all states of our subjectivity (actions, emotions, thoughts) – by an empathic relationship with ourselves. the auto-empathy relationship is a process of distancing, and symbolic appropriation, in which we are divided into halves, implementing our innate ability to be both subject and object for ourselves. results the mediatization of auto-empathy in digital worlds can put ourselves instead of a figure that represents us – our avatar – so that our empathy is turned towards ourselves indirectly. this second time of empathy for a virtual figure of the self, called “mediatized auto-empathy” or “virtual auto-empathy”, would contribute thirdly to the development of empathy for oneself. finally, the development of empathy for others would be supported in a fourth time, by the attention the players are paying to each other in network games. discussion these four hypotheses, illustrated by clinical cases, open an interrogation concerning the frame of the psychoanalytical work. in the adolescent, the work of virtualisation, which consists in the creative anticipation of its subjective possibilities, seems regularly impeded. the mental duplicity is no longer in a position to operate a symbolizing distance between the real self and the virtual self, between the subjective self and the subjectivising self. the other-in-oneself is ineffective in proposing to the adolescent an empathic dialogue with oneself. consequently, the autorepresentation flirts with the seizure, in particular in the subjective states of breaks. nevertheless, the digital spaces could be indirect media of appropriation of subjective experiences for the teenager. conclusion our reflections led us to think of auto-empathy as the realization of the other-in-oneself which allows us to represent our own subjective world. the auto-empathy mediatized by an avatar can thus be described as a representation by empathy of our subjective part that contains this character. from then on, the space of the video game appears as a space of subjectivation.",2016,2021-05-19T13:19:58Z,2021-05-19T13:19:58Z,NA,293-308,NA,2,81,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Empathy; Phenomenology; Auto-empathy; MMORPG; Video

(considering our need for more empathy in and around the design and planning of the street ecology, we need to recognize that autonomous robotic vehicles are by definition, lacking empathy. or to put it another way, the act of caring will need to be programmed into our streets if we are to achieve our goals for empathy, equity, and justice. if you think about a driver getting into a car now—the protection the steel frame—the power and strength the car offers the driver, it literally makes the driver less empathetic. so applying that concept to avs who have no ability to empathize to begin with, we need to start programming empathy into the avs or else it will function like a robot—taking over the street with indifference. so we have to ask, how do we program empathy? if you needed to make an object empathetic, what is the first thing you would tell it? probably you would tell it to feel. how do you tell a robot to feel? feelings cannot be programmed. can you legitimately create rules, and then prioritize one rule over another. and do you prioritize the safety of the pedestrian over the safety of the passenger? it seems to almost all rules have to should prioritize the humanity of the street ecology first, and then the driver/passenger. would the car companies let this happen? we have our work cut out) much depends on what and how we value and prioritize how we measure things, how we understand these measures, and then how we act in response to realize the sustainability, livability, and equity promises of our streets, communities and regions. for this, we need to examine and understand our guiding principles and goals, and this other dimension of performance (speed, volume, access, place) before engaging in processes to develop plans and designs to create livable and complete streets and communities, as discussed in the following chapters of part iii—realizing the promise of our streets.",2021,2021-05-19T13:21:48Z,2021-05-19T13:21:48Z,NA,307-333,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Elsevier,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,DOI: 10.1016/B978-0-12-816028-2.00018-6,NA,NA,NA,Empathy; Agents; Actors; Bicycling; Equity; Ethical livability; Human rights to the street; Humanity; Justice; Livability ethics; Stewards; Walking,NA,"Bruce; Appleyard, Donald",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

phénomène psychique, l’« auto-empathie », tel qu’il est mis en œuvre dans le contexte des espaces numériques et singulièrement dans la situation du joueur qui incarne un avatar (une figure de pixel) dans un jeu vidéo. méthode dans la perspective d’une ouverture théorique à la fois phénoménologique et psychanalytique, l’auto-empathie est le processus au cours duquel, en prenant la position de l’« autrui-en-soi », nous nous représentons notre monde subjectif – soit l’ensemble de nos états de subjectivité (actions, émotions, pensées) –, par relation empathique avec nous-mêmes. cette relation d’auto-empathie correspond à une opération de distanciation, et d’appropriation symbolique, au cours de laquelle nous nous dédoublons, en mettant en œuvre notre faculté innée d’être à la fois sujet et objet pour nous-mêmes. résultats la médiatisation de l’auto-empathie dans les mondes numériques permet de nous mettre à la place d’une figure qui nous représente – notre avatar –, de sorte que notre empathie est tournée vers nous-mêmes indirectement. ce second temps d’empathie pour une figure virtuelle de soi, nommé « auto-empathie médiatisée » ou « auto-empathie virtuelle », favoriserait dans un troisième temps le développement d’une empathie pour soi. enfin, le développement d’une empathie pour autrui serait soutenu dans un quatrième temps, par l’attention que les joueurs se portent les uns aux autres dans les jeux en réseau. discussion ces quatre hypothèses, illustrées par des cas cliniques, ouvrent une interrogation portant sur le cadre en psychanalyse. à l’adolescence, le travail de virtualisation, qui consiste en l’anticipation créatrice de ses possibilités subjectives, apparaît régulièrement contrarié. la duplicité psychique n’est plus à même d’opérer une distance symbolisante entre le soi réel et le soi virtuel, entre le soi subjectif et le soi subjectivant. l’autrui-en-soi est inefficace à proposer à l’adolescence un dialogue empathique avec soi-même. en conséquence, l’autoreprésentation flirte avec l’effondrement, en particulier dans les états de cassures subjectives. or, les espaces numériques pourraient bien être pour l’adolescent des supports indirects d’appropriation d’expériences subjectives. conclusion nos réflexions ont conduit à penser l’auto-empathie comme la réalisation de l’autrui-en-soi qui permet de nous représenter notre propre monde subjectif. l’auto-empathie médiatisée par un avatar peut donc être décrite comme une représentation par empathie de notre part subjective contenue par ce personnage. dès lors, l’espace du jeu vidéo se présente comme un espace de subjectivation. objectives the authors propose to explore a psychic phenomenon, the “auto-empathy”, as implemented in the context of digital spaces and particularly in the situation of the player who embodies an avatar (a pixel figure) in a video game. method from the perspective of a theoretical opening both phenomenological and psychoanalytic, auto-empathy is the process in which, taking the position of the “other-in-oneself”, we represent our subjective world – or the all states of our subjectivity (actions, emotions, thoughts) – by an empathic relationship with ourselves. the auto-empathy relationship is a process of distancing, and symbolic appropriation, in which we are divided into halves, implementing our innate ability to be both subject and object for ourselves. results the mediatization of auto-empathy in digital worlds can put ourselves instead of a figure that represents us – our avatar – so that our empathy is turned towards ourselves indirectly. this second time of empathy for a virtual figure of the self, called “mediatized auto-empathy” or “virtual auto-empathy”, would contribute thirdly to the development of empathy for oneself. finally, the development of empathy for others would be supported in a fourth time, by the attention the players are paying to each other in network games. discussion these four hypotheses, illustrated by clinical cases, open an interrogation concerning the frame of the psychoanalytical work. in the adolescent, the work of virtualisation, which consists in the creative anticipation of its subjective possibilities, seems regularly impeded. the mental duplicity is no longer in a position to operate a symbolizing distance between the real self and the virtual self, between the subjective self and the subjectivising self. the other-in-oneself is ineffective in proposing to the adolescent an empathic dialogue with oneself. consequently, the autorepresentation flirts with the seizure, in particular in the subjective states of breaks. nevertheless, the digital spaces could be indirect media of appropriation of subjective experiences for the teenager. conclusion our reflections led us to think of auto-empathy as the realization of the other-in-oneself which allows us to represent our own subjective world. the auto-empathy mediatized by an avatar can thus be described as a representation by empathy of our subjective part that contains this character. from then on, the space of the video game appears as a space of subjectivation.",2016,2021-05-19T13:21:49Z,2021-05-19T13:21:49Z,NA,293-308,NA,2,81,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Empathy; Phenomenology; Auto-empathy; MMORPG; Video
