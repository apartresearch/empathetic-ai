Major depression is associated with impaired psychosocial functioning and reduced quality of life. Challenges such as shortage of mental health personnel, long waiting times, perceived stigma, and lower government spends pose barriers to the alleviation of mental health problems. Face-to-face psychotherapy alone provides only point-in-time support and cannot scale quickly enough to address this growing global public health challenge. Artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled, empathetic, and evidence-driven conversational mobile app technologies could play an active role in filling this gap by increasing adoption and enabling reach. Although such a technology can help manage these barriers, they should never replace time with a health care professional for more severe mental health problems. However, app technologies could act as a supplementary or intermediate support system. Mobile mental well-being apps need to uphold privacy and foster both short- and long-term positive outcomes. Objective: This study aimed to present a preliminary real-world data evaluation of the effectiveness and engagement levels of an AI-enabled, empathetic, text-based conversational mobile mental well-being app, Wysa, on users with self-reported symptoms of depression. Methods: In the study, a group of anonymous global users were observed who voluntarily installed the Wysa app, engaged in text-based messaging, and self-reported symptoms of depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. On the basis of the extent of app usage on and between 2 consecutive screening time points, 2 distinct groups of users (high users and low users) emerged. The study used mixed-methods approach to evaluate the impact and engagement levels among these users. The quantitative analysis measured the app impact by comparing the average improvement in symptoms of depression between high and low users. The qualitative analysis measured the app engagement and experience by analyzing in-app user feedback and evaluated the performance of a machine learning classifier to detect user objections during conversations. Results: The average mood improvement (ie, difference in pre- and post-self-reported depression scores) between the groups (ie, high vs low users; n=108 and n=21, respectively) revealed that the high users group had significantly higher average improvement (mean 5.84 [SD 6.66]) compared with the low users group (mean 3.52 [SD 6.15]); Mann-Whitney P=.03 and with a moderate effect size of 0.63. Moreover, 67.7% of user-provided feedback responses found the app experience helpful and encouraging. Conclusions: The real-world data evaluation findings on the effectiveness and engagement levels of Wysa app on users with self-reported symptoms of depression show promise. However, further work is required to validate these initial findings in much larger samples and across longer periods.","2018-11-23","2021-02-11 01:07:42","2021-02-11 01:07:42","2021-02-11 01:07:42","e12106","","11","6","","","An Empathy-Driven, Conversational Artificial Intelligence Agent (Wysa) for Digital Mental Well-Being","","","","","","","EN","Unless stated otherwise, all articles are open-access distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work (""first published in JMIR mHealth and uHealth..."") is properly cited with original URL and bibliographic citation information.

We assume that generalised states of the world are valuable – not rewards themselves, and propose an extension of AIXI, in which rewards are used only to bootstrap hierarchical value learning. The modified AIXI agent is considered in the multi-agent environment, where other agents can be either humans or other ‘mature’ agents, the values of which should be revealed and adopted by the ‘infant’ AGI agent. A general framework for designing such empathic agent with ethical bias is proposed as an extension of the universal intelligence model as well.

It provides a way to increase our understanding of the link between affective and cognitive processes and enhance our interaction with artificial agents. However, the variety of fields contributing to empathy research has resulted in isolated approaches to modeling empathy, and this has led to various definitions of empathy and an absence of common ground regarding underlying empathic processes. Although this diversity may be useful in that it allows for an in-depth examination of various processes linked to empathy, it also may not yet provide a coherent theoretical picture of empathy. We argue that a clear theoretical positioning is required for collective progress. The aim of this article is, therefore, to call for a holistic and multilayered view of a model of empathy, taken from the rich background research from various disciplines. To achieve this, we present a comprehensive background on the theoretical foundations, followed by the working definitions, components, and models of empathy that are proposed by various fields. Following this introduction, we provide a detailed review of the existing techniques used in AI research to model empathy in interactive agents, focusing on the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. We conclude with a discussion of future directions in this emerging field.","2020-04-01","2021-02-11 01:07:45","2021-02-11 01:07:45","2021-02-11 01:07:45","2983-3006","","4","53","","Artif Intell Rev","Modeling empathy","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\esben\Zotero\storage\V73B9B4I\Yalçın and DiPaola - 2020 - Modeling empathy building a link between affectiv.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In our work, emotional alignment is realized by endowing a virtual human with the ability to empathize. Recent research shows that humans empathize with each other to different degrees depending on several factors including, among others, their mood, their personality, and their social relationships. Although providing virtual humans with features like affect, personality, and the ability to build social relationships, little attention has been devoted to the role of such features as factors modulating their empathic behavior. Supported by psychological models of empathy, we propose an approach to model empathy for the virtual human EMMA—an Empathic MultiModal Agent—consisting of three processing steps: First, the Empathy Mechanism by which an empathic emotion is produced. Second, the Empathy Modulation by which the empathic emotion is modulated. Third, the Expression of Empathy by which EMMA’s multiple modalities are triggered through the modulated empathic emotion. The proposed model of empathy is illustrated in a conversational agent scenario involving the virtual humans MAX and EMMA.","2011-05-19","2021-02-11 01:07:46","2021-02-11 01:07:46","2021-02-11 01:07:46","195","","3","25","","Künstl Intell","Empathy-Based Emotional Alignment for a Virtual Human","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\esben\Zotero\storage\FBHIZ23Q\Boukricha and Wachsmuth - 2011 - Empathy-Based Emotional Alignment for a Virtual Hu.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The human vulnerabilities experienced in the healthcare context raise the stakes of new technologies such as AI, and the human dimensions of AI in healthcare have particular significance for research in the humanities. This article explains four key areas of concern relating to AI and the role that medical/health humanities research can play in addressing them: definition and regulation of “medical” versus “health” data and apps; social determinants of health; narrative medicine; and technological mediation of care. Issues include data privacy and trust, flawed datasets and algorithmic bias, racial discrimination, and the rhetoric of humanism and disability.

Although this promises to deliver increased speed and accuracy, the future role of AI in relation to radiotherapy should be thought through carefully. There is currently a gap between published developments and widespread adoption, which provides some space to prepare the workforce and to consider the implications on practice. It is rare to find philosophical input into a medical journal, but the advent of AI makes this perspective increasingly important. Philosophical insight can help explore the potential impact of AI, in particular, on human creativity and oversight. Without this perspective, we run the risk of focusing solely on the immediate logistical impact on patients and departments. This commentary identifies three key aspects of radiotherapy that the authors feel would suffer most under AI control: creativity, innovation, and patient safety, which all demand uniquely human attributes. The article also provides insight from a philosophical perspective with regard to human consciousness, ethics, and empathy. Philosophically we should, perhaps, retain ethical concerns about the widening role of AI in radiotherapy beyond simple quantitative interpretation and image processing. As developments continue, we have time to determine how our roles will evolve and to establish a framework for ensuring appropriate human input into patient care. Most importantly, we must start to embed a philosophical approach to adoption of AI technology from the outset if we are to prepare ourselves for the challenge that lies ahead.</p>","2019-12-01","2021-02-11 01:16:07","2021-02-11 01:16:07","2021-02-11 01:16:07","S27-S31","","4","50","","Journal of Medical Imaging and Radiation Sciences","Artificial Intelligence in Radiotherapy","","","","","","","English","","","","","www.jmirs.org","","Publisher: Elsevier PMID: 31591033","","C:\Users\esben\Zotero\storage\UYVKS8MC\Bridge and Bridge - 2019 - Artificial Intelligence in Radiotherapy A Philoso.pdf; ; C:\Users\esben\Zotero\storage\UQ54MAEI\fulltext.html","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31591033","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since then, technology has changed society so dramatically that the focus of study has shifted toward society’s ability to adapt to technological change. Technology and rapid communications weaken the capacity of society to integrate into the broader social structure those people who have had little or no access to education. (Most of the recent use of communications by the excluded has been disruptive, not integrative.) Interweaving of socioeconomic activity and large-scale systems had a dehumanizing effect on people excluded from social participation by these trends. Jobs vanish at an accelerating rate. Marketing creates demand for goods which stress the global environment, even while the global environment no longer yields readily accessible resources. Mining and petroleum firms push into ever more challenging environments (e.g., deep mines and seabed mining) to meet resource demands. These activities are expensive, and resource prices rise rapidly, further excluding groups that cannot pay for these resources. The impact of large-scale systems on society leads to mass idleness, with the accompanying threat of violent reaction as unemployed masses seek to blame both people in power as well as the broader social structure for their plight. Perhaps, the impact of large-scale systems on society has already eroded essential qualities of humanness. Humans, when they feel “socially useless,” are dehumanized. (At the same time, machines (at any scale) seem incapable of emotion or empathy.) Has the cost of technological progress been too high to pay? These issues are addressed in this paper.","2013-02-01","2021-02-11 01:16:09","2021-02-11 01:16:09","2021-02-11 01:16:09","107-115","","1","28","","AI & Soc","Artificial intelligence and society","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\esben\Zotero\storage\Z3JD5QGA\Kile - 2013 - Artificial intelligence and society a furtive tra.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The process of producing new design ideas is explained by a transparent analysis of designers’ language and behaviors. Three strategies to organize cognitive activities in design ideation are summarized: develop structured consideration, relate to a scenario, and stick-to designing. These strategies suggest AI could act as (1) representation creation, (2) empathy trigger and (3) engagement, in principles of “knowledge-driven” and “decompose-and-integrate”. The design support with AI provides new perspectives on computer-based design tools that limit to well-defined design variables. The framework is built on a generic notion of design activity and “mimic” human design rationales, expected to benefit research of domain-independent computational design supports and cognitive supports.","2020-11-01","2021-02-11 01:16:11","2021-02-11 01:16:11","2021-02-11 01:16:11","511-544","","5-6","35","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Taylor & Francis _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/07370024.2020.1733576","","C:\Users\esben\Zotero\storage\QWSZZGYI\07370024.2020.html","","","artificial intelligence; design supports; Human computer interaction theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The pace of change is expected to accelerate as tools improve and as demands for analyzing a rapidly growing body of knowledge and array of data increase. The medical students of today will practice in a world where information technology is sophisticated and omnipresent. In this world, the tasks of memorization and analysis will be less important to them as practicing physicians. On the other hand, the nonanalytical, humanistic aspects of medicine—most importantly, the art of caring—will remain a critical function of the physician, and facility with improving systems of care will be required. Communication, empathy, shared decision making, leadership, team building, and creativity are all skills that will continue to gain importance for physicians.

A useful thought experiment is the application of the Turing test to user-facing artificial intelligence systems in health care (such as chatbots or conversational agents). In this paper I argue that many medical decisions require value judgements and the doctor-patient relationship requires empathy and understanding to arrive at a shared decision, often handling large areas of uncertainty and balancing competing risks. Arguably, medicine requires wisdom more than intelligence, artificial or otherwise. Artificial intelligence therefore needs to supplement rather than replace medical professionals, and identifying the complementary positioning of artificial intelligence in medical consultation is a key challenge for the future. In health care, artificial intelligence needs to pass the implementation game, not the imitation game.

Objective: This study aimed to explore general practitioners’ (GPs’) opinions about the potential impact of future technology on key tasks in primary care. Methods: In June 2018, we conducted a Web-based survey of 720 UK GPs’ opinions about the likelihood of future technology to fully replace GPs in performing 6 key primary care tasks, and, if respondents considered replacement for a particular task likely, to estimate how soon the technological capacity might emerge. This study involved qualitative descriptive analysis of written responses (“comments”) to an open-ended question in the survey. Results: Comments were classified into 3 major categories in relation to primary care: (1) limitations of future technology, (2) potential benefits of future technology, and (3) social and ethical concerns. Perceived limitations included the beliefs that communication and empathy are exclusively human competencies; many GPs also considered clinical reasoning and the ability to provide value-based care as necessitating physicians’ judgments. Perceived benefits of technology included expectations about improved efficiencies, in particular with respect to the reduction of administrative burdens on physicians. Social and ethical concerns encompassed multiple, divergent themes including the need to train more doctors to overcome workforce shortfalls and misgivings about the acceptability of future technology to patients. However, some GPs believed that the failure to adopt technological innovations could incur harms to both patients and physicians. Conclusions: This study presents timely information on physicians’ views about the scope of artificial intelligence (AI) in primary care. Overwhelmingly, GPs considered the potential of AI to be limited. These views differ from the predictions of biomedical informaticians. More extensive, stand-alone qualitative work would provide a more in-depth understanding of GPs’ views.

The workshops focused on (1) understanding the current consultation context and identifying existing problems, (2) ideating future solutions to these problems, and (3) discussing future roles for AI in primary care. The workshop activities included affinity diagramming, brainwriting, and video prototyping methods. The workshops were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Inductive thematic analysis of the transcripts of conversations was performed.Two researchers facilitated 3 co-design workshops with 16 general practitioners. Three main themes emerged: professional autonomy, human-AI collaboration, and new models of care. Major implications identified within these themes included (1) concerns with medico-legal aspects arising from constant recording and accessibility of full consultation records, (2) future consultations taking place out of the exam rooms in a distributed system involving empowered patients, (3) human conversation and empathy remaining the core tasks of doctors in any future AI-enabled consultations, and (4) questioning the current focus of AI initiatives on improved efficiency as opposed to patient care.AI documentation assistants will likely to be integral to the future primary care consultations. However, these technologies will still need to be supervised by a human until strong evidence for reliable autonomous performance is available. Therefore, different human-AI collaboration models will need to be designed and evaluated to ensure patient safety, quality of care, doctor safety, and doctor autonomy.","2020-11-01","2021-02-11 01:16:29","2021-02-11 01:16:29","2021-02-11 01:16:29","1695-1704","","11","27","","Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association","Envisioning an artificial intelligence documentation assistant for future primary care consultations","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","","C:\Users\esben\Zotero\storage\2L3PMJEQ\Kocaballi et al. - 2020 - Envisioning an artificial intelligence documentati.pdf; C:\Users\esben\Zotero\storage\HIFT8YNW\5897463.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This research attempts to model specific forms of intelligence through brute-force search heuristics and also reproduce features of human perception and cognition, including emotions. Such goals have implications for artificial consciousness, with some arguing that it will be achievable once we overcome short-term engineering challenges. We believe, however, that phenomenal consciousness cannot be implemented in machines. This becomes clear when considering emotions and examining the dissociation between consciousness and attention in humans. While we may be able to program ethical behavior based on rules and machine learning, we will never be able to reproduce emotions or empathy by programming such control systems—these will be merely simulations. Arguments in favor of this claim include considerations about evolution, the neuropsychological aspects of emotions, and the dissociation between attention and consciousness found in humans.

Google promotes a new form of “infrastructural intelligence,” which excels by constantly reassessing its cognitive architecture in exchange with a cloud of data that surrounds it, and exhibits putatively human capacities such as intuition. I argue that such (re)alignments of biological and artificial intelligence have been enabled by a paradigmatic infrastructuralization of the brain in contemporary neuroscience. This infrastructuralization is based in methodologies that epistemically liken the brain to complex systems of an entirely different scale (i.e., global logistics) and has given rise to diverse research efforts that target the neuronal infrastructures of higher cognitive functions such as empathy and creativity. What is at stake in this process is no less than the shape of brains to come and a revised understanding of the intelligent and creative social subject.","2017-01-01","2021-02-11 01:16:33","2021-02-11 01:16:33","2021-02-11 01:16:33","101-128","","","233","","","Chapter 5 - Infrastructural intelligence","Vital Models","","","","Elsevier","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","DOI: 10.1016/bs.pbr.2017.06.004","","C:\Users\esben\Zotero\storage\BH9A7XHX\S0079612317300547.html","","","Artificial intelligence; Brain imaging; Computational neuroscience; Default mode network; Google DeepMind technologies","Mahfoud, Tara; McLean, Sam; Rose, Nikolas","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Facing challenges wrought by science and technology as well as societal change, the curriculum is increasingly out of synch with new needs in teaching content and medical practice. The path to significant curricular reform is difficult because of a variety of factors, including deeply entrenched values, the natural resistance to change, and the accreditation process. Indeed, even the very definition of what it means to be a professional is changing with profound implications for the future role of the physician and the sacrosanct doctor–patient relationship.         In this Invited Commentary, the author enumerates challenges facing medical education in the current era. To address these challenges, the author recommends specific curricular emphases for 21st-century medical education: knowledge capture and curation, collaboration with and management of artificial intelligence applications, a deep understanding of probabilistic reasoning, and the cultivation of empathy and compassion in accordance with ethical standards. Given these needs, it is imperative that schools act today to undertake significant curricular reform and, in so doing, strive to make the hard changes necessary to produce optimal practitioners in a rapidly transforming 21st century. The author provides first steps an institution can take to begin to address these challenges.","2019-10","2021-02-11 01:18:15","2021-02-11 01:18:15","2021-02-11 01:18:15","1412–1415","","10","94","","","","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","journals.lww.com","","","","C:\Users\esben\Zotero\storage\I2SEBSKU\The_Empirical_Challenge_of_21st_Century_Medical.9.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper presents the experience of one aspect of artificial intelligence, machine learning, coupled with patient empathy to improve utilization of assisted reproductive technology (ART), which is an important aspect of care that is under-recognized. Although ART provides very effective options for infertile patients to build families, patients often discontinue ART when further treatment is likely to be beneficial and most of these patients do not achieve pregnancy without medical aid. Use of ART is only in part dependent on financial considerations; stress and other factors play a major role, as shown by high discontinuation rates despite reimbursement.

BACKGROUND          Meaningful recognition positively impacts nursing and organizational outcomes. The use of AI techniques such as natural language processing and machine learning to identify and describe behaviors impacting patient experiences is an emerging science.         METHODS          Nurse recognition comments were collected from a convenience sample of 3 organizations via an IPC inpatient platform and analyzed using the AI techniques of natural language processing, machine learning, sentiment analytics, and corollary dictionaries based on rules of linguistics.         RESULTS          The top theme of nursing recognition comments was courtesy and respect with the behaviors of empathy/compassion, helpfulness, kindness, attentiveness, and emotional comfort. The theme of skills/knowledge was the 2nd most common, with the behaviors of being professional, knowledgeable, keeping track, competence, dedication, and being thorough.         CONCLUSIONS          AI techniques for qualitative analysis of comments collected through IPC reveal nurse themes and behaviors most meaningful to patients and their family members. Nurses can advance the science of AI and guide its evolution so that nurse caring behaviors associated with establishing human connections that positively influence patient and family experience are accurately represented.","2019-06","2021-02-11 01:18:21","2021-02-11 01:18:21","2021-02-11 01:18:21","303–309","","6","49","","","Leveraging Technology to Sustain Extraordinary Care","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","journals.lww.com","","","","C:\Users\esben\Zotero\storage\W2NDVXST\Leveraging_Technology_to_Sustain_Extraordinary.6.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Collectively, these have resulted in the modification of the physician’s role as the gatekeeper for health care, increased shift-based care, and amplified interprofessional team-based care. Technological innovations present opportunities as well as challenges. Artificial intelligence, which has great potential, has already transformed some tasks, particularly those involving image interpretation. Ubiquitous access to information via the Internet by physicians and patients alike presents benefits as well as drawbacks: patients and providers have ready access to virtually all of human knowledge, but some websites are contaminated with misinformation and many people have difficulty differentiating between solid, evidence-based data and untruths. The role of the future physician will shift as complexity in health care increases and as artificial intelligence and other technologies advance. These technological advances demand new skills of physicians; memory and knowledge accumulation will diminish in importance while information management skills will become more important. In parallel, medical educators must enhance their teaching and assessment of critical human skills (e.g., clear communication, empathy) in the delivery of patient care. The authors emphasize the enduring role of critical human skills in safe and effective patient care even as medical practice is increasingly guided by artificial intelligence and related technology, and they suggest new and longitudinal ways of assessing essential noncognitive skills to meet the demands of the future. The authors envision practical and achievable benefits accruing to patients and providers if practitioners leverage technological advancements to facilitate the development of their critical human skills.","2021-01","2021-02-11 01:18:22","2021-02-11 01:18:22","2021-02-11 01:18:22","37–43","","1","96","","","","","","","","","","en-US","","","","","journals.lww.com","","","","C:\Users\esben\Zotero\storage\FPN3CQUW\Technology_Can_Augment,_but_Not_Replace,_Critical.33.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the past few years, there has been a surge of research into various newer areas. The present article looks at the non-neurobiological and non-cognitive theories regarding this complex phenomenon, especially ones that self-psychology, self-theory, artificial intelligence, quantum physics, visual cognitive science and philosophy have to offer. Self-psychology has proposed the need to understand the self and its development, and the ramifications of the self for morality and empathy, which will help us understand consciousness better. There have been inroads made from the fields of computer science, machine technology and artificial intelligence, including robotics, into understanding the consciousness of these machines and their implications for human consciousness. These areas are explored. Visual cortex and emotional theories along with their implications are discussed. The phylogeny and evolution of the phenomenon of consciousness is also highlighted, with theories on the emergence of consciousness in fetal and neonatal life. Quantum physics and its insights into the mind, along with the implications of consciousness and physics and their interface are debated. The role of neurophilosophy to understand human consciousness, the functions of such a concept, embodiment, the dark side of consciousness, future research needs and limitations of a scientific theory of consciousness complete the review. The importance and salient features of each theory are discussed along with certain pitfalls, if present. A need for the integration of various theories to understand consciousness from a holistic perspective is stressed.","2013-01-01","2021-02-11 01:18:25","2021-02-11 01:18:25","2021-02-11 01:18:25","151","","1","11","","","Towards an integrative theory of consciousness","","","","","","","en","","","","","www.msmonographs.org","","Company: Medknow Publications and Media Pvt.

This paper suggests that users' help is a practical approach to improve accuracy and it considers four factors that trigger users' willingness to help for an imperfect AI system. The two factors covered in Study 1 are utilitarian benefit based on egoistic motivation, and empathy based on altruistic motivation. In Study 2, utilitarian benefit is divided into explainable AI and monetary reward. The results indicate that two variables, namely empathy and monetary reward, have significant positive effects on willingness to help, and monetary reward is the strongest stimulus. In addition, explainable AI is shown to be positively associated with trust in AI. This study applies social studies of help motivation to the HCI field in order to induce users' willingness to help for an imperfect AI. The triggers of help motivation, empathy and monetary reward, can be utilized to induce the users’ voluntary engagement in the loop with an imperfect AI.","2019-12-01","2021-02-11 01:18:30","2021-02-11 01:18:30","2021-02-11 01:18:30","180-196","","","101","","Computers in Human Behavior","Egoistic and altruistic motivation","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\esben\Zotero\storage\UKNFMWFE\Lee et al. - 2019 - Egoistic and altruistic motivation How to induce .pdf; C:\Users\esben\Zotero\storage\VC5I6E8H\S0747563219302274.html","","","AI (Artificial Intelligence); Explainable AI; Food image recognition; Human in the loop (HITL); Trust; Willingness to help","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Life experience and imagination are as essential to narrative as narrative is to mankind. The phylogenic perspective of literature suggests an inborn capacity for empathy, intelligence and inventiveness, whereas the ontological example is variable. Western knowledge, politics and ethics have evolved from their narrative of Greek myth, epic and drama, the few medieval writers, singularly by the Elizabethan theater, importantly the Arthurian legend and romance stories, English and Russian novels, and uniquely the American short story. This heritage progressively demarcated such life themes as the hero, maiden and adversary; love, hate and indifference; loyalty, deception and betrayal; desire, achievement and loss. These characterizations of self and other remain relevant to the contemporary novel, cinema/TV, and theater, as well as the news, commentary, and real life. Conversely, postmodern assumptions challenge that individual subjectivity determines what is real, valid or authentic, consequently the relativism of traditional, institutional and historical precedents of the truth. Further, the computer, gaming, smart device, and artificial intelligence have changed the content and function of customary narrative. Nonetheless, narrative — real and imagined, ancient and new — retains the meaning of a story about connected events which variously transcends the boundaries of difference.","2019-10-03","2021-02-11 01:19:59","2021-02-11 01:19:59","2021-02-11 01:19:59","476-484","","7","39","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Routledge _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/07351690.2019.1659025","","C:\Users\esben\Zotero\storage\CJI9EMC3\07351690.2019.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To achieve this, robots must interact with people in natural ways, employing social mechanisms that people use while interacting with each other. One such mechanism is empathy, often seen as the basis of social cooperation and prosocial behaviour. We argue that artificial companions capable of behaving in an empathic manner, which involves the capacity to recognise another's affect and respond appropriately, are more successful at establishing and maintaining a positive relationship with users. This paper presents a study where an autonomous robot with empathic capabilities acts as a social companion to two players in a chess game. The robot reacts to the moves played on the chessboard by displaying several facial expressions and verbal utterances, showing empathic behaviours towards one player and behaving neutrally towards the other. Quantitative and qualitative results of 31 participants indicate that users towards whom the robot behaved empathically perceived the robot as friendlier, which supports our hypothesis that empathy plays a key role in human-robot interaction.<br>Highlights: ► We have developed an empathic robot that comments a chess match between two players. ► The robot displays empathic behaviours towards one of the players and behaves neutrally towards the other player. ► The empathic model is based on the idea that to obtain empathy one has to put himself/herself on the other's shoes. ► The results of a trial with 40 participants are described and discussed. ► Participants towards whom the robot behaved empathically perceived the robot as friendlier.","2013","2021-02-15 22:17:28","2021-02-15 22:17:28","","250-260","","3","71","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 5902447489","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Series B, Biological sciences","","0962-8436","","","To what extent can humans form social relationships with robots? In the present study, we combined functional neuroimaging with a robot socializing intervention to probe the flexibility of empathy, a core component of social relationships, towards robots. Twenty-six individuals underwent identical fMRI sessions before and after being issued a social robot to take home and interact with over the course of a week. While undergoing fMRI, participants observed videos of a human actor or a robot experiencing pain or pleasure in response to electrical stimulation. Repetition suppression of activity in the pain network, a collection of brain regions associated with empathy and emotional responding, was measured to test whether socializing with a social robot leads to greater overlap in neural mechanisms when observing human and robotic agents experiencing pain or pleasure. In contrast to our hypothesis, functional region-of-interest analyses revealed no change in neural overlap for agents after the socializing intervention. Similarly, no increase in activation when observing a robot experiencing pain emerged post-socializing. Whole-brain analysis showed that, before the socializing intervention, superior parietal and early visual regions are sensitive to novel agents, while after socializing, medial temporal regions show agent sensitivity. A region of the inferior parietal lobule was sensitive to novel emotions, but only during the pre-socializing scan session. Together, these findings suggest that a short socialization intervention with a social robot does not lead to discernible differences in empathy towards the robot, as measured by behavioural or brain responses. We discuss the extent to which long-term socialization with robots might shape social cognitive processes and ultimately our relationships with these machines.

In this situation, robots will require sophisticated capabilities, such as the ability to recognize human pain in advance and generate counter-responses as follow up emphatic action. Hence, it is important for robots to acquire an appropriate pain concept that allows them to develop these capabilities. This paper conceptualizes empathy generation through the realization of synthetic pain classes integrated into a robot's self-awareness framework, and the implementation of fault detection on the robot body serves as a primary source of pain activation. Projection of human shoulder motion into the robot arm motion acts as a fusion process, which is used as a medium to gather information for analyses then to generate corresponding synthetic pain and emphatic responses. An experiment is designed to mirror a human peer's shoulder motion into an observer robot. The results demonstrate that the fusion takes place accurately whenever unified internal states are achieved, allowing accurate classification of synthetic pain categories and generation of empathy responses in a timely fashion. Future works will consider a pain activation mechanism development.","2018","2021-02-15 22:17:28","2021-02-15 22:17:28","","56-73","","1","5","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8583916455","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the speaker-listener scenario, the speaker is always a child, the listener is a human or a toy robot.

Revealing potential similarities in communicative exchanges in both groups when in contact with a human or a toy robot, the results might signify that emotional empathy requires the implication of an automatic identification. In this sense, emotional empathy might be considered a broad idiosyncrasy, a kind of synchronisation, offering the mind a peculiar form of communication. Our findings seem to be consistent with the assumption that children’s brains would be constructed to simulate the feelings of others in order to ensure interpersonal synchronisation.","2018","2021-02-15 22:17:28","2021-02-15 22:17:28","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 7891657455","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For the purpose of these arguments, I make a distinction between empathy-as-cognition and empathy-as-feeling, connecting the latter to the moral sentiment tradition and its concept of “fellow feeling.” Furthermore, I sympathise with the intuition that vulnerability mirroring raises the ethical issue of deception. However, given the importance of appearance in social relations, problems with the concept of deception, and contemporary technologies that question the artificial-natural distinction, we cannot easily justify the underlying assumptions of the deception objection.

To test our hypothesis, we implemented a robot called MEI (multimodal emotional intelligence) with these functions, and allowed it to interact with human caregivers using comfort and approval motherese, the first kinds of vocalizations heard by infants at 3 and 6 months of age. The robot synchronized in real-time to the humans through voice and movement dynamics, while training statistical models associated with its low level gut feeling (“flourishing” or “distress”, based on battery or temperature). Experiments show that the post-interaction robot associates novel happy voices with physical flourishing 90 % of the time, sad voices with distress 84 % of the time. Our results also show that a robot trained with infant-directed “attention bids” can recognize adult fear voices. Importantly, this is the first emotion system to recognize adult emotional voices after training only with motherese, suggesting that this specific parental behavior may help build emotional intelligence.","2015","2021-02-15 22:17:28","2021-02-15 22:17:28","","35-49","","1","7","","","A Recipe for Empathy","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 5778623320","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The empirical understanding of the drivers of visitors' intentions to use robots in such services has become an urgent necessity for their sustainable deployment.

In this paper, via structural equation modelling (SEM) and semi-structured interviews with managers, we conceptualise and empirically test visitors' intentions to use social robots in hospitality services. With data collected in Singapore's hospitality settings, we found visitors' intentions to use social robots stem from the effects of technology acceptance variables, service quality dimensions leading to perceived value, and two further dimensions from human robot interaction (HRI): empathy and information sharing. Analysis of these dimensions' importance provides a deeper understanding of novel opportunities managers may take advantage of to position social robot-delivered services in tourism and hospitality strategies.","2020","2021-02-15 22:17:42","2021-02-15 22:17:42","","","","","78","","","Leveraging human-robot interaction in hospitality services","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8524221774","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A fundamental requirement in all social interactions is the ability to engage, maintain, and demonstrate attention. Attentional behaviors include leaning forward, self-disclosure, and changes in voice pitch. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the effect of robot attentional behaviors on user perceptions and behaviors in a simulated health care interaction. METHODS: A parallel randomized controlled trial with a 1:1:1:1 allocation ratio was conducted. We randomized participants to 1 of 4 experimental conditions before engaging in a scripted face-to-face interaction with a fully automated medical receptionist robot. Experimental conditions included a self-disclosure condition, voice pitch change condition, forward lean condition, and neutral condition. Participants completed paper-based postinteraction measures relating to engagement, perceived robot attention, and perceived robot empathy. We video recorded interactions and coded for participant attentional behaviors. RESULTS: A total of 181 participants were recruited from the University of Auckland. Participants who interacted with the robot in the forward lean and self-disclosure conditions found the robot to be significantly more stimulating than those who interacted with the robot in the voice pitch or neutral conditions (P=.03). Participants in the forward lean, self-disclosure, and neutral conditions found the robot to be significantly more interesting than those in the voice pitch condition (P<.001). Participants in the forward lean and self-disclosure conditions spent significantly more time looking at the robot than participants in the neutral condition (P<.001). Significantly, more participants in the self-disclosure condition laughed during the interaction (P=.01), whereas significantly more participants in the forward lean condition leant toward the robot during the interaction (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: The use of self-disclosure and forward lean by a health care robot can increase human engagement and attentional behaviors. Voice pitch changes did not increase attention or engagement. The small effects with regard to participant perceptions are potentially because of the limitations in self-report measures or a lack of comparison for most participants who had never interacted with a robot before. Further research could explore the use of self-disclosure and forward lean using a within-subjects design and in real health care settings.","2019","2021-02-15 22:17:42","2021-02-15 22:17:42","","","","10","21","","","The Effect of Robot Attentional Behaviors on User Perceptions and Behaviors in a Simulated Health Care Interaction","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8270511494","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we use a simple neuroscience-inspired procedure to beam our human subjects into one of two distinct robots and demonstrate how this can readily increase acceptability and social closeness to that robot. Participants wore a Head Mounted Display tracking their head movements and displaying the 3D visual scene taken from the eyes of a robot which was positioned in front of a mirror and piloted by the subjects’ head movements. As a result, participants saw themselves as a robot. When participant’ and robot’s head movements were correlated, participants felt that they were incorporated into the robot with a sense of agency.

Its first dimension is auto-empathy and refers to an empathetic relationship with oneself: how can a human directing a robot expand the various components of empathy he feels for himself to this robot? The second is direct empathy: what does a human attribute to a robot in terms of thoughts, emotions, action potentials or even altruism, on the model of what he imagines and attributes to himself? The third dimension is reciprocal empathy that consists of thinking that a robot is able to identify with me, feel or guess my emotions and thoughts, anticipate my actions and wear me assistance if necessary. Finally, the fourth dimension, intersubjective empathy, is about thinking and imagining that a robot can inform me of things - emotions, thoughts that I am likely to experience- that I do not know about myself. Each of these four dimensions includes four different components: (1) Action (empathy of action), (2) Emotion (emotional empathy), (3) Cognition (cognitive empathy) and (4) Assistance (empathy of assistance). This theoretical model of empathy in four dimensions and four components defines sixteen items whose relevance will be tested in the near future through comparative experimental research involving human-human and human-robot interaction.","2015","2021-02-15 22:17:42","2021-02-15 22:17:42","","97-102","","1","7","","","Testing Empathy with Robots","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 5778625970","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper we describe how such an affective reasoning has been implemented in the NAO robot for simulating empathic behaviors in the context of AAL. In particular, the robot is able to recognize the emotion of the user by analyzing communicative signals extracted from speech and facial expressions. The recognized emotion allows triggering the robot’s affective state and, consequently, the most appropriate empathic behavior. The robot’s empathic behaviors have been evaluated both by experts in communication and through a user study aimed at assessing the perception and interpretation of empathy by elderly users.

However, RAT using humanoid robots is still a novel practice for which the adhesion mechanisms, indications and benefits remain unclear. Also, little is known about how the robot's behavioral and affective style might promote engagement of persons with dementia (PwD) in RAT. The present study sought to investigate the use of a humanoid robot in a psychomotor therapy for PwD. We examined the robot's potential to engage participants in the intervention and its effect on their emotional state. A brief psychomotor therapy program involving the robot as the therapist's assistant was created. For this purpose, a corpus of social and physical behaviors for the robot and a ""control software"" for customizing the program and operating the robot were also designed. Particular attention was given to components of the RAT that could promote participant's engagement (robot's interaction style, personalization of contents). In the pilot assessment of the intervention nine PwD (7 women and 2 men, M age = 86 y/o) hospitalized in a geriatrics unit participated in four individual therapy sessions: one classic therapy (CT) session (patient- therapist) and three RAT sessions (patient-therapist-robot). Outcome criteria for the evaluation of the intervention included: participant's engagement, emotional state and well-being; satisfaction of the intervention, appreciation of the robot, and empathy-related behaviors in human-robot interaction (HRI). Results showed a high constructive engagement in both CT and RAT sessions. More positive emotional responses in participants were observed in RAT compared to CT. RAT sessions were better appreciated than CT sessions. The use of a social robot as a mediating tool appeared to promote the involvement of PwD in the therapeutic intervention increasing their immediate wellbeing and satisfaction.","2017","2021-02-15 22:17:42","2021-02-15 22:17:42","","","","","8","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 7088352818","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Patients who perceive empathic treatment have increased satisfaction and improved outcomes. We sought to determine if an empathic SAR could be developed and used to decrease pain and fear associated with peripheral IV placement in children. Methods: We conducted a pilot study of children receiving IV placement. Participating children were randomized to interact with (1) no robot, or a commercially available 3D printed humanoid SAR robot programmed with (2) empathy or (3) distraction conditions. Children and parents completed demographic surveys, and children used an adapted validated questionnaire to rate the robot's empathy on an 8-point Likert scale. Survey scores were compared by the t-test or chi-square test. Pain and fear were measured by self-report using the FACES and FEAR scales, and video tapes were coded using the CHEOPS and FLACC. Scores were compared using repeated measures 2-way ANOVA. This trial is registered with NCT02840942. Results: Thirty-one children with an average age of 9.6 years completed the study. For all measures, mean pain and fear scores were lowest in the empathy group immediately before and after IV placement. Children were more likely to attribute characteristics of empathy to the empathic condition (Likert score 7.24 v. 4.70; p=0.012) and to report that having the empathic vs. distraction robot made the IV hurt less (7.45 vs. 4.88; p=0.026). Conclusions: Children were able to identify SAR designed to display empathic characteristics and reported it helped with IV insertion pain and fear. Mean scores of self-reported or objective pain and fear scales were the lowest in the empathy group and the highest in the distraction condition before and after IV insertion. This result suggests empathy improves SAR functionality when used for painful medical procedures and informs future research into SAR for pain management.","2020","2021-02-15 22:17:42","2021-02-15 22:17:42","","","","","2020","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8585130163","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This article works with a twofold purpose: firstly, to consider the impact of artificial empathy in nursing and, secondly, to describe the influence of Affective Developmental Robotics (ADR) in anticipation of the empathic behaviour presented by artificial humanoid robots. The ADR has demonstrated that it can be one means by which humanoid nurse robots can achieve expressions of more relatable artificial empathy. This will be one of the vital models for intelligent humanoid robots currently in nurse robot development for the healthcare industry.

Based on social-psychological predictions of human behavior, the approach aims at inducing empathy, paired with a feeling of similarity in human users towards the robot. This is achieved by two differently expressed emotional control variables: by an explicit statement of similarity before task-related interaction, and implicitly expressed by adapting the emotional state of the robot to the mood of the human user, such that the current values of the human mood in the dimensions of pleasure, arousal, and dominance (PAD) are matched. The thereby shifted emotional state of the robot serves as a basis for the generation of task-driven emotional facial- and verbal expressions, employed to induce and sustain high empathy towards the robot throughout the interaction. The approach is evaluated in a user study utilizing an expressive robot head. The effectiveness of the approach is confirmed by significant experimental results. An analysis of the individual components of the approach reveals significant effects of explicit emotional adaption on helpfulness, as well as on the HRI-key concepts anthropomorphism and animacy.","2013","2021-02-15 22:17:55","2021-02-15 22:17:55","","457-476","","4","5","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 5660019419","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous neuroimaging studies have indicated that neural responses of empathy for others' pain are modulated by an early automatic emotional sharing and a late controlled cognitive evaluation process. Recent studies about pain empathy for robots found humans present similar empathy process towards humanoid robots under painful stimuli as well as to humans. However, the whole-brain functional connectivity and the spatial dynamics of neural activities underlying empathic processes are still unknown. In the present study, the functional connectivity was investigated for ERPs recorded from 18 healthy adults who were presented with pictures of human hand and robot hand under painful and non-painful situations. Functional brain networks for both early and late empathy responses were constructed and a new parameter, empathy index (EI), was proposed to represent the empathy ability of humans quantitatively. We found that the mutual dependences between early ERP components was significantly decreased, but for the late components, there were no significant changes. The mutual dependences for human hand stimuli were larger than to robot hand stimuli for early components, but not for late components. The connectivity weights for early components were larger than late components. EI value shows significant difference between painful and non-painful stimuli, indicating it is a good indicator to represent the empathy of humans. This study enriches our understanding of the neurological mechanisms implicated in human empathy, and provides evidence of functional connectivity for both early and late responses of pain empathy towards humans and robots.","2021","2021-02-15 22:17:55","2021-02-15 22:17:55","","","","","151","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8738882970","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"UMSC35IE","journalArticle","2013","","EEG Theta and Mu Oscillations during Perception of Human and Robot Actions","Frontiers in Neurorobotics","","1662-5218","","","Perception of others’ actions supports important social skills, such as communication, intention understanding, and empathy. Are mechanisms of action processing in human brain specifically tuned to process biological agents? Humanoid robots can perform recognizable actions, but can look and move differently from humans so they can be used as stimuli to address such questions. Here, we recorded EEG during the observation of human and robot actions. Sensorimotor mu (8-13 Hz) rhythm has been linked to the motor simulation aspect of action processing (and to human mirror neuron system, MNS) and frontal theta (4-8 Hz) rhythm to semantic and memory-related aspects. We explored whether these measures exhibit selectivity for biological entities: for whether the motion and/or the visual appearance of the observed agent is biological. Participants watched videos of three agents performing the same actions. The first was a Human, and had biological motion and appearance. The other two were a state-of-the-art robot in two different appearances: Android, which had biological appearance but mechanical motion, and Robot, which had mechanical motion and appearance. Observation of all agents induced significant attenuation in the power of mu oscillations that was equivalent for all agents. Thus, mu suppression, considered an index of the activity of the MNS, did not appear to be selective for biological agents.

Are mechanisms of action processing in the human brain specifically tuned to process biological agents? Humanoid robots can perform recognizable actions, but can look and move differently from humans, and as such, can be used in experiments to address such questions. Here, we recorded EEG as participants viewed actions performed by three agents. In the Human condition, the agent had biological appearance and motion. The other two conditions featured a state-of-the-art robot in two different appearances: Android, which had biological appearance but mechanical motion, and Robot, which had mechanical appearance and motion. We explored whether sensorimotor mu (8-13 Hz) and frontal theta (4-8 Hz) activity exhibited selectivity for biological entities, in particular for whether the visual appearance and/or the motion of the observed agent was biological. Sensorimotor mu suppression has been linked to the motor simulation aspect of action processing (and the human mirror neuron system, MNS), and frontal theta to semantic and memory-related aspects. For all three agents, action observation induced significant attenuation in the power of mu oscillations, with no difference between agents. Thus, mu suppression, considered an index of MNS activity, does not appear to be selective for biological agents. Observation of the Robot resulted in greater frontal theta activity compared to the Android and the Human, whereas the latter two did not differ from each other. Frontal theta thus appears to be sensitive to visual appearance, suggesting agents that are not sufficiently biological in appearance may result in greater memory processing demands for the observer.

Socially-assistive robots (SAR) have been used to reduce pain and distress in children in medical settings. Patients who perceive empathic treatment have increased satisfaction and improved outcomes. We sought to determine if an empathic SAR could be developed and used to decrease pain and fear associated with peripheral IV placement in children. Methods. We conducted a pilot study of children receiving IV placement. Participating children were randomized to interact with (1) no robot, or a commercially available 3D printed humanoid SAR robot programmed with (2) empathy or (3) distraction conditions. Children and parents completed demographic surveys, and children used an adapted validated questionnaire to rate the robot’s empathy on an 8-point Likert scale. Survey scores were compared by the t-test or chi-square test. Pain and fear were measured by self-report using the FACES and FEAR scales, and video tapes were coded using the CHEOPS and FLACC. Scores were compared using repeated measures 2-way ANOVA. This trial is registered with NCT02840942. Results. Thirty-one children with an average age of 9.6 years completed the study. For all measures, mean pain and fear scores were lowest in the empathy group immediately before and after IV placement. Children were more likely to attribute characteristics of empathy to the empathic condition (Likert score 7.24 v. 4.70; p=0.012) and to report that having the empathic vs. distraction robot made the IV hurt less (7.45 vs. 4.88; p=0.026). Conclusions. Children were able to identify SAR designed to display empathic characteristics and reported it helped with IV insertion pain and fear. Mean scores of self-reported or objective pain and fear scales were the lowest in the empathy group and the highest in the distraction condition before and after IV insertion. This result suggests empathy improves SAR functionality when used for painful medical procedures and informs future research into SAR for pain management.","2020","2021-02-15 22:18:05","2021-02-15 22:18:05","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8580272503","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A fundamental aspect of a companion robot is a cross-communication system that enables natural interactions between humans and the robot. This paper focuses on three points in the development of our proposed framework: (1) the organization of the behavior including inside-state emotion regarding the phylogenetic consciousness-based architecture; (2) a method whereby the robot can have empathy toward its human user’s expressions of emotion; and (3) a method that enables the robot to select a facial expression in response to the human user, providing instant human-like ‘emotion’ and based on emotional intelligence (EI) that uses a biologically inspired topological online method to express, for example, encouragement or being delighted.

Mind perception also modulates the attitudes we have toward others, and determines the degree of empathy, prosociality, and morality invested in social interactions. Seeing mind in others is not exclusive to human agents, but mind can also be ascribed to non-human agents like robots, as long as their appearance and/or behavior allows them to be perceived as intentional beings. Previous studies have shown that human appearance and reliable behavior induce mind perception to robot agents, and positively affect attitudes and performance in human-robot interaction. What has not been investigated so far is whether different triggers of mind perception have an independent or interactive effect on attitudes and performance in human-robot interaction. We examine this question by manipulating agent appearance (human vs. robot) and behavior (reliable vs. random) within the same paradigm and examine how congruent (human/reliable vs. robot/random) versus incongruent (human/random vs. robot/reliable) combinations of these triggers affect performance (i.e., gaze following) and attitudes (i.e., agent ratings) in human-robot interaction. The results show that both appearance and behavior affect human-robot interaction but that the two triggers seem to operate in isolation, with appearance more strongly impacting attitudes, and behavior more strongly affecting performance.

However, while considerable progress has been made in recent years in terms of their technological realization, the ability of robots to interact with humans in an intuitive and social way is still quite limited. An important challenge for social robotics is to determine how to design robots that can perceive the user's needs, feelings, and intentions, and adapt to users over a broad range of cognitive abilities. It is conceivable that if robots were able to adequately demonstrate these skills, humans would eventually accept them as social companions. We argue that the best way to achieve this is using a systematic experimental approach based on behavioral and physiological neuroscience methods such as motion/eye-tracking, electroencephalography, or functional near-infrared spectroscopy embedded in interactive human-robot paradigms. This approach requires understanding how humans interact with each other, how they perform tasks together and how they develop feelings of social connection over time, and using these insights to formulate design principles that make social robots attuned to the workings of the human brain. In this review, we put forward the argument that the likelihood of artificial agents being perceived as social companions can be increased by designing them in a way that they are perceived as intentional agents that activate areas in the human brain involved in social-cognitive processing. We first review literature related to social-cognitive processes and mechanisms involved in human-human interactions, and highlight the importance of perceiving others as intentional agents to activate these social brain areas. We then discuss how attribution of intentionality can positively affect human-robot interaction by (a) fostering feelings of social connection, empathy and prosociality, and by (b) enhancing performance on joint human-robot tasks. Lastly, we describe circumstances under which attribution of intentionality to robot agents might be disadvantageous, and discuss challenges associated with designing social robots that are inspired by neuroscientific principles.","2017","2021-02-15 22:18:05","2021-02-15 22:18:05","","","","","8","","","Robots As Intentional Agents","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 7162799280","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, we conducted an exploratory study to empirically examine children's perceptions toward the computer- and robot-mediated AR systems designed to make dramatic play activities interactive and participatory. A multi-disciplinary expert group consisting of early childhood education experts, preschool teachers, AR specialists, and robot engineers collaborated to develop a learning scenario and technological systems for dramatic play. The experiment was conducted in a kindergarten setting in Korea, with 81 children (aged 5-6 years old). The participants were placed either in the computer-mediated AR condition (n = 40) or the robot-mediated AR condition (n = 41). We administered an instrument to measure children's perceived levels of the following variables: (a) satisfaction (i.e., interest in dramatic play & user-friendliness), (b) sensory immersion (i.e., self-engagement, environment-engagement & interaction-engagement), and (c) media recognition (i.e., collaboration with media, media function & empathy with media). Data analysis indicates that children in the robot-mediated condition showed significantly higher perceptions than those in the computer-mediated condition regarding the following aspects: interest in dramatic play (satisfaction), interactive engagement (sensory immersion), and empathy with media (media recognition). Furthermore, it was found that the younger-aged children and girls, in particular, perceived AR-infused dramatic play more positively than the olderaged children and boys, respectively. The contribution of this study is to provide empirical evidence about the affordances of robots and AR-based learning systems for young children. This remains a relatively unexplored area of research in the field of learning technologies.

Atypical responsiveness to social rewards, which reinforce socially appropriate behavior in children, can potentially lead to a cascade of deficits in social behavior. Individuals with ASC often show diminished spontaneous mimicry of social stimuli in a natural setting. In the general population, mimicry is modulated both by the reward value and the sociality of the stimulus (i.e., whether the stimulus is perceived to belong to a conspecific or an inanimate object). Since empathy and autistic traits are distributed continuously in the general population, this study aimed to test if and how these traits modulated automatic mimicry of rewarded social and nonsocial stimuli. High and low rewards were associated with human and robot hands using a conditioned learning paradigm. Thirty-six participants from the general population then completed a mimicry task involving performing a prespecified hand movement which was either compatible or incompatible with a hand movement presented to the participant. High autistic traits (measured using the Autism Spectrum Quotient, AQ) predicted lesser mimicry of high-reward than low-reward conditioned human hands, whereas trait empathy showed an opposite pattern of correlations. No such relations were observed for high-reward vs. low-reward conditioned robot hands. These results demonstrate how autistic traits and empathy modulate the effects of reward on mimicry of social compared to nonsocial stimuli. This evidence suggests a potential role for the reward system in underlying the atypical social behavior in individuals with ASC, who constitute the extreme end of the spectrum of autistic traits. <i><b>Autism Res</b> 2013, 6: 614-620.</i> © 2013 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","2013","2021-02-15 22:18:21","2021-02-15 22:18:21","","614-620","","6","6","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 5496210755","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our approach is motivated by the notion that in many cultures, trust-building can be boosted by small body gestures. We discuss the integration of a robot capable of such movements within CRECA, our context-respectful counseling agent. The frequent nodding called “unazuki” in Japan, often accompanying the “un-un” sound (meaning “I agree”) of Japanese onomatopoeia, underlines empathy and embodies unconditioned approval. We argue that “unazuki” creates more empathy and promotes longer conversation between the robotic counsellor and people. We set up an experiment involving ten subjects to verify these effects. Our quantitative evaluation is based on the classic metrics of utterance, adapted to support the Japanese language. Interactions featuring “unazuki” showed higher value of this metrics. Moreover, subjects assessed the counselling robot’s trustworthiness and kindness as “very high” (Likert scale: 5.5 versus 3—4.5) showing the effect of social gestures in promoting empathetic dialogue to general people including the younger generation. Our findings support the importance of social movements when using robotized agents as a therapeutic tool aimed at improving emotional state and social interactions, with unambiguous evidence that embodiment can have a positive impact that warrants further exploration.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to find technological solutions that meet the needs of mothers during the year following childbirth. METHODS: Two co-creation workshops were undertaken with parents and professionals. The aim of the first workshop was to create a list of all the criteria the proposed solution would have to address to meet the needs of mothers after childbirth. The aim of the second workshop was to create solutions in response to the criteria selected during the first workshop. RESULTS: Parents and health professionals want solutions that include empathy (ie, to help fight against the feelings of abnormality and loneliness), that help mothers in daily life, that are personalized and adapted to different situations, that are educational, and that assures some continuity in their contact with health professionals. In practice, we found that parents and professionals think the solution should be accessible to everyone and available at all times. To address these criteria, technology experts proposed different solutions, such as a forum dedicated to the postpartum period that is supervised by professionals, a centralized website, a system of videoconferencing, an online exchange group, a ""gift voucher"" system, a virtual reality app, or a companion robot. CONCLUSIONS: The human component seems to be very important during the postnatal period. Nevertheless, technology could be a great ally in helping mothers during the postpartum period.

Robotic interventions have been explored for use with ASD children worldwide revealing that robots encourage one-to-one social and emotional interactions. However, associations between interpersonal synchronisation and emotional empathy have not yet been directly explored in French and Japanese ASD children when they interact with a human or a robot under analogous experimental conditions.

According to the Roboethics Roadmap (Gianmarco Veruggio), it is the human ethics of robot designers, manufacturers, and users. And ifroboethics roots deeply in society, artificial ethics (ethics of robots) might be put on the agenda some day. At the 1st International Symposium on Roboethics in San Remo, Ronald C. Arkin gave the presentation ""Bombs, Bonding, and Bondage: Human-Robot Interaction and Related Ethical Issues"" (2004). ""Bondage"" is the issue of enslavement and possible rebellion of robots. ""Bombs"" is the issue of military use of robots. And ""bonding"" is the issue of affective, emotional attachment of humans to robots. I contrast two extreme attitudes towards the issue of ""bonding"" and propose a middle ground. ""Anthropomorphism"" has two meanings. First, it means ""human-shaped-ness."" Second, it means ""attribution of human characteristics or feelings to a nonhuman being (god, animal, or object)"" (personification, empathy). Some say that Japanese (or East Asians) hold ""animism,"" which makes it easy for them to treat robots like animated beings (to anthropomorphize robots); hence ""Robot Kingdom Japan."" Cosima Wagner criticizes such exaggeration and oversimplification as ""invented tradition"". I reinforce her argument with neuroscientific findings and argue that such ""animism"" is neither Shintoistic nor Buddhistic, but a universal tendency. Roboticists, especially Japanese roboticists emphasize that robotics is ""anthropology."" It is true that through the construction of humanoid robots we can better understand human beings (so-called ""constructive approach""). But at the same time, we must not forget that robotic technology, like any other technology, changes our way of living and being--deeply: it can bring about our ontological transformation. In this sense, the governance of robotic technology is ""governed governance."" The interdisciplinary research area of technology assessment studies (TAS) will gain much importance. And we should always be ready to rethink the direction of the research and development of robotic technology, bearing the desirable future of human society in mind.","2013","2021-02-15 22:18:35","2021-02-15 22:18:35","","17-26","","4","24","","","Ethica ex machina","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 5537702789","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

How people react to these agents is telling about the perceived empathy of such agents. Mistreatment of robots (or computers) by co-workers might provoke such telling reactions. This study examines perceived mistreatment directed towards a robot in comparison to a computer. This will provide some understanding of how people feel about robots in collaborative social settings. We conducted a two by two between-subjects study with 80 participants. Participants worked cooperatively with either a robot or a computer agent. An experiment confederate would either act aggressively or neutrally towards the agent. We hypothesized that people would not perceive aggressive speech as mistreatment when an agent was capable of emotional feelings and similar to themselves; that participants would perceive the robot as more similar in appearance and emotionally capable to themselves than a computer; and so would observe more mistreatment with a robot. The final results supported our hypotheses; the participants observed greater mistreatment for the robot, but not the computer. Also participants felt significantly more sympathetic towards the robot and believed that it was much more emotionally capable.","2019","2021-02-15 22:18:35","2021-02-15 22:18:35","","727-739","","5","11","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8545090891","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this article in order to analyze human behaviors in social context, we propose a new approach which explores interrelations between body part motions in scenarios with people doing a conversation. The novelty of this method is that we analyze body motion-based features in frequency domain to estimate different human social patterns: Interpersonal Behaviors (IBs) and a Social Role (SR). To analyze the dynamics and interrelations of people's body motions, a human movement descriptor is used to extract discriminative features, and a multi-layer Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) technique is proposed to model the existent dependencies. Laban Movement Analysis (LMA) is a well-known human movement descriptor, which provides efficient mid-level information of human body motions. The mid-level information is useful to extract the complex interdependencies. The DBN technique is tested in different scenarios to model the mentioned complex dependencies. The study is applied for obtaining four IBs (Interest, Indicator, Empathy and Emphasis) to estimate one SR (Leading).The obtained results give a good indication of the capabilities of the proposed approach for people interaction analysis with potential applications in human-robot interaction.","2016","2021-02-15 22:18:35","2021-02-15 22:18:35","","1679-91","","8","38","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 6389012015","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

On the one hand, we performed this study to assess the quality of the current facial expressions of two robot heads. On the other hand, we aimed at developing a simple, easy-to-use methodological variation to evaluate facial expressions of robotic heads. Short movie clips of two different robot heads showing a happy, sad, surprised, and neutral facial expression were compiled into an online survey, to examine how people interpret these expressions. Additionally, we added a control condition with a human face showing the same four emotions. The results showed that the facial expressions could be recognized well for both heads. Even the blender emotion surprised was recognized, although it resulted in positive and negative connotations. These results underline the importance of the situational context to correctly interpret emotional facial expressions. Besides the expected finding that the human is perceived significantly more anthropomorphic and animate than both robot heads, the more human-like designed robot head was rated significantly higher with respect to anthropomorphism than the robot head using animal-like features. In terms of the validation procedure, we could provide evidence for a feasible two-step procedure. By assessing the participants’ dispositional empathy with a questionnaire it can be ensured that they are in general able to decode facial expressions into the corresponding emotion.

The behavior that would induce human-like feelings after long exposures is difficult to determine, and it often depends on the cultural background of the observers. Therefore, in this study, we generate an acting performance system for the android, in which an android and a human interact in a stage play in the real world. We adopt the theatrical theory called Contemporary Colloquial Theatre Theory to give the android natural behaviors so that audiences can comfortably observe it even after long-minute exposure. A stage play is created and shown in various locations, and the audiences are requested to report their impressions of the stage and their cultural and psychological backgrounds in a self-evaluating questionnaire. Overall analysis indicates that the audience had positive feelings, in terms of attractiveness, towards the android on the stage even after 20 min of exposure. The singularly high acceptance of the android by Japanese audiences seems to be correlated with a high animism tendency, rather than to empathy. We also discuss how the stage play approach is limited and could be extended to contribute to realization of human-robot interaction in the real world.","2017","2021-02-15 22:18:35","2021-02-15 22:18:35","","","","4","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8081433483","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Twenty-one individuals were asked to play the ultimatum game, playing the role of a responder against another person, a computer, an avatar and a robot for a total of 32 games (8 per condition). We hypothesize that affective expressions by avatars and robots influence the emotional state of the users, leading them to irrational behavior by rejecting unfair proposals. We monitored galvanic skin response and heart rate of the players in the period when the offer was made by the proposer until the decision was announced by the responder. Our results show that most fair offers were accepted while most unfair offers were rejected.

To program EM-2 the author re-purposes code and architectural ideas from collaborative multi-agent systems and affective common sense reasoning with new concepts and philosophies from the human arts and sciences relating to compassion. EM-2 has predicates and an agent architecture based on a meta-cognition mental process that was used on India's worst prisoners to cultivate compassion for others, Vipassana or mindfulness. She describes and presents code snippets for common sense based affective inference and the I-TMS, an Irrational Truth Maintenance System, that maintains consistency in agent memory as feelings change over time, and provides a machine theoretic description of the consistency issues of combining affect and logic.

However, the traditional use of didactic lectures for communication skills training is ineffective, and the use of standardized patients is not time- or cost-effective. Given the abilities of virtual patients (VPs) to simulate interactive and authentic clinical scenarios in secured environments with unlimited training attempts, a virtual counseling application is an ideal platform for nursing students to hone their communication skills before their clinical postings. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop and test the use of VPs to better prepare nursing undergraduates for communicating with real-life patients, their family members, and other health care professionals during their clinical postings. METHODS: The stages of the creation of VPs included preparation, design, and development, followed by a testing phase before the official implementation. An initial voice chatbot was trained using a natural language processing engine, Google Cloud's Dialogflow, and was later visualized into a three-dimensional (3D) avatar form using Unity 3D. RESULTS: The VPs included four case scenarios that were congruent with the nursing undergraduates' semesters' learning objectives: (1) assessing the pain experienced by a pregnant woman, (2) taking the history of a depressed patient, (3) escalating a bleeding episode of a postoperative patient to a physician, and (4) showing empathy to a stressed-out fellow final-year nursing student. Challenges arose in terms of content development, technological limitations, and expectations management, which can be resolved by contingency planning, open communication, constant program updates, refinement, and training. CONCLUSIONS: The creation of VPs to assist in nursing students' communication skills training may provide authentic learning environments that enhance students' perceived self-efficacy and confidence in effective communication skills. However, given the infancy stage of this project, further refinement and constant enhancements are needed to train the VPs to simulate real-life conversations before the official implementation.","2019","2021-02-15 22:20:17","2021-02-15 22:20:17","","","","10","21","","","A Virtual Counseling Application Using Artificial Intelligence for Communication Skills Training in Nursing Education","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8293773349","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recently, a new HIP has been designed aiming at higher security: the Civil Rights Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart (CAPTCHA). It employs the empathy capacity of humans to further strengthen Securimage, a well-known text CAPTCHA. In this paper, we analyze it from a security perspective, finding fundamental design flaws. Using several well-known machine learning (ML) algorithms, we analyze to what extent these flaws affect its security. We discover that thanks to them, we can create a successful side-channel attack. This attack is able to correctly solve the HIP on 20.7<i>%</i> of occasions, much more than enough to consider it broken. Thus, we show that there is no need to solve the problem of optical character recognition nor empathy analysis for computers to break this particular HIP. ML can be successfully used to break a HIP that uses both with a side-channel attack. This security analysis can be applied to other HIPs.

An untested implication of this hypothesis is that these stable patterns of connectivity should be visible even in the absence of empathy tasks. Using machine learning, we demonstrate that patterns of resting state fMRI connectivity (i.e. the degree of synchronous BOLD activity across multiple cortical areas in the absence of explicit task demands) of resonance and control networks predict trait empathic concern (n = 58). Empathic concern was also predicted by connectivity patterns within the somatomotor network. These findings further support the role of resonance-control network interactions and of somatomotor function in our vicariously driven concern for others. Furthermore, a practical implication of these results is that it is possible to assess empathic predispositions in individuals without needing to perform conventional empathy assessments.","2020","2021-02-15 22:21:09","2021-02-15 22:21:09","","","","","14","","","Predicting Empathy From Resting State Brain Connectivity","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8542389208","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We believe, however, that phenomenal consciousness cannot be implemented in machines. This becomes clear when considering emotions and examining the dissociation between consciousness and attention in humans. While we may be able to program ethical behavior based on rules and machine learning, we will never be able to reproduce emotions or empathy by programming such control systems-these will be merely simulations.

Importantly, this neural mirroring is not constant; rather, it is modulated by our beliefs about their intentions, circumstances, and group allegiances. We investigated if the neural empathic response is modulated by minimally-differentiating information (e.g., a simple text label indicating another's religious belief), and if neural activity changes predict ingroups and outgroups across independent paradigms. We found that the empathic response was larger when participants viewed a painful event occurring to a hand labeled with their own religion (ingroup) than to a hand labeled with a different religion (outgroup). Counterintuitively, the magnitude of this bias correlated positively with the magnitude of participants' self-reported empathy. A multivariate classifier, using mean activity in empathy-related brain regions as features, discriminated ingroup from outgroup with 72% accuracy; the classifier's confidence correlated with belief certainty. This classifier generalized successfully to validation experiments in which the ingroup condition was based on an arbitrary group assignment. Empathy networks thus allow for the classification of long-held, newly-modified and arbitrarily-formed ingroups and outgroups. This is the first report of a single machine learning model on neural activation that generalizes to multiple representations of ingroup and outgroup. The current findings may prove useful as an objective diagnostic tool to measure the magnitude of one's group affiliations, and the effectiveness of interventions to reduce ingroup biases.","2018","2021-02-15 22:21:20","2021-02-15 22:21:20","","","","","12","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 7808493438","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, it is not known whether real-world altruists’ heightened empathy reflects true self-other mapping of multi-voxel neural response patterns. We investigated this relationship in adults who had engaged in extraordinarily costly real-world altruism: donating a kidney to a stranger. Altruists and controls completed fMRI testing while anticipating and experiencing pain, and watching as a stranger anticipated and experienced pain. Machine learning classifiers tested for shared representation between experienced and observed distress. Altruists exhibited more similar representations of experienced and observed fearful anticipation spontaneously and following an empathy prompt in anterior insula and anterior/middle cingulate cortex, respectively, suggesting heightened empathic proclivities and abilities for fear. During pain epochs, altruists were distinguished by spontaneous empathic responses in anterior insula, anterior/mid-cingulate cortex and supplementary motor area, but showed no difference from controls after the empathy prompt. These findings (1) link shared multi-voxel representations of the distress of self and others to real-world costly altruism, (2) reinforce distinctions between empathy for sensory states like pain and anticipatory affective states like fear, and (3) highlight the importance of differentiating between the proclivity and ability to empathize.","2019","2021-02-15 22:21:20","2021-02-15 22:21:20","","1-11","","1","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8207465742","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The survey measured opinions about the likelihood future technology would fully replace physicians in performing ten key psychiatric tasks. This study involved qualitative descriptive analysis of written responses (""comments"") to three open-ended questions in the survey. Results: Comments were classified into four major categories in relation to the impact of future technology on: (1) patient-psychiatrist interactions; (2) the quality of patient medical care; (3) the profession of psychiatry; and (4) health systems. Overwhelmingly, psychiatrists were skeptical that technology could replace human empathy. Many predicted that 'man and machine' would increasingly collaborate in undertaking clinical decisions, with mixed opinions about the benefits and harms of such an arrangement. Participants were optimistic that technology might improve efficiencies and access to care, and reduce costs. Ethical and regulatory considerations received limited attention.

However, only few studies have investigated how functional network changes are related to social anhedonia. The aim of this fMRI study was to classify subjects according to their degree of social anhedonia using supervised machine learning. More specifically, we extracted both spatial and temporal network features during a social cognition task from 70 subjects, and used support vector machines for classification. Since impairment in social cognition is well established in schizophrenia-spectrum disorders, the subjects performed a comic strip task designed to specifically probe theory of mind (ToM) and empathy processing. Features representing both temporal (time series) and network dynamics were extracted using task activation maps, seed region analysis, independent component analysis (ICA), and a newly developed multi-subject archetypal analysis (MSAA), which here aimed to further bridge aspects of both seed region analysis and decomposition by incorporating a spotlight approach.We found significant classification of subjects with elevated levels of social anhedonia when using the times series extracted using MSAA, indicating that temporal dynamics carry important information for classification of social anhedonia. Interestingly, we found that the same time series yielded the highest classification performance in a task classification of the ToM condition. Finally, the spatial network corresponding to that time series included both prefrontal and temporal-parietal regions as well as insula activity, which previously have been related schizotypy and the development of schizophrenia.","2019","2021-02-15 22:21:32","2021-02-15 22:21:32","","4965-4981","","17","40","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8199458307","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The survey measured opinions about the likelihood future technology would fully replace physicians in performing ten key psychiatric tasks. This study involved qualitative descriptive analysis of written responses (“comments”) to three open-ended questions in the survey. Results Comments were classified into four major categories in relation to the impact of future technology on: (1) patient-psychiatrist interactions; (2) the quality of patient medical care; (3) the profession of psychiatry; and (4) health systems. Overwhelmingly, psychiatrists were skeptical that technology could replace human empathy. Many predicted that ‘man and machine’ would increasingly collaborate in undertaking clinical decisions, with mixed opinions about the benefits and harms of such an arrangement. Participants were optimistic that technology might improve efficiencies and access to care, and reduce costs. Ethical and regulatory considerations received limited attention.

However, these computer-delivered interventions rely on mouse, keyboard, or touchscreen responses for interactions between the users and the computer-delivered intervention. The principles of motivational interviewing suggest that in-person interventions may be effective, in part, because they encourage individuals to think through and speak aloud their motivations for changing a health behavior, which current computer-delivered interventions do not allow. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to take the initial steps toward development of a voice-based computer-delivered intervention that can ask open-ended questions and respond appropriately to users' verbal responses, more closely mirroring a human-delivered motivational intervention. METHODS: We developed (1) a voice-based computer-delivered intervention that was run by a human controller and that allowed participants to speak their responses to scripted prompts delivered by speech generation software and (2) a text-based computer-delivered intervention that relied on the mouse, keyboard, and computer screen for all interactions. We randomized 60 heavy drinking college students to interact with the voice-based computer-delivered intervention and 30 to interact with the text-based computer-delivered intervention and compared their ratings of the systems as well as their motivation to change drinking and their drinking behavior at 1-month follow-up. RESULTS: Participants reported that the voice-based computer-delivered intervention engaged positively with them in the session and delivered content in a manner consistent with motivational interviewing principles. At 1-month follow-up, participants in the voice-based computer-delivered intervention condition reported significant decreases in quantity, frequency, and problems associated with drinking, and increased perceived importance of changing drinking behaviors. In comparison to the text-based computer-delivered intervention condition, those assigned to voice-based computer-delivered intervention reported significantly fewer alcohol-related problems at the 1-month follow-up (incident rate ratio 0.60, 95% CI 0.44-0.83, P=.002). The conditions did not differ significantly on perceived importance of changing drinking or on measures of drinking quantity and frequency of heavy drinking. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that it is feasible to construct a series of open-ended questions and a bank of responses and follow-up prompts that can be used in a future fully automated voice-based computer-delivered intervention that may mirror more closely human-delivered motivational interventions to reduce drinking. Such efforts will require using advanced speech recognition capabilities and machine-learning approaches to train a program to mirror the decisions made by human controllers in the voice-based computer-delivered intervention used in this study. In addition, future studies should examine enhancements that can increase the perceived warmth and empathy of voice-based computer-delivered intervention, possibly through greater personalization, improvements in the speech generation software, and embodying the computer-delivered intervention in a physical form.","2017","2021-02-15 22:21:32","2021-02-15 22:21:32","","","","2","4","","","Initial Progress Toward Development of a Voice-Based Computer-Delivered Motivational Intervention for Heavy Drinking College Students","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 7088227141","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) measured the self-regulatory components of personality critical for health (i.e., the character traits of self-directedness, cooperativeness, and self-transcendence). In a discovery sample of 2149 healthy Finns, we identified sets of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that cluster within particular individuals (i.e., SNP sets) regardless of phenotype. Second, we identified five clusters of people with distinct profiles of character traits regardless of genotype. Third, we found 42 SNP sets that identified 727 gene loci and were significantly associated with one or more of the character profiles. Each character profile was related to different SNP sets with distinct molecular processes and neuronal functions. Environmental influences measured in childhood and adulthood had small but significant effects. We confirmed the replicability of 95% of the 42 SNP sets in healthy Korean and German samples, as well as their associations with character. The identified SNPs explained nearly all the heritability expected for character in each sample (50 to 58%). We conclude that self-regulatory personality traits are strongly influenced by organized interactions among more than 700 genes despite variable cultures and environments. These gene sets modulate specific molecular processes in brain for intentional goal-setting, self-reflection, empathy, and episodic learning and memory.","2018","2021-02-15 22:21:32","2021-02-15 22:21:32","","2295-2312","","10","25","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8671687952","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore general practitioners' (GPs') opinions about the potential impact of future technology on key tasks in primary care. METHODS: In June 2018, we conducted a Web-based survey of 720 UK GPs' opinions about the likelihood of future technology to fully replace GPs in performing 6 key primary care tasks, and, if respondents considered replacement for a particular task likely, to estimate how soon the technological capacity might emerge. This study involved qualitative descriptive analysis of written responses (""comments"") to an open-ended question in the survey. RESULTS: Comments were classified into 3 major categories in relation to primary care: (1) limitations of future technology, (2) potential benefits of future technology, and (3) social and ethical concerns. Perceived limitations included the beliefs that communication and empathy are exclusively human competencies; many GPs also considered clinical reasoning and the ability to provide value-based care as necessitating physicians' judgments. Perceived benefits of technology included expectations about improved efficiencies, in particular with respect to the reduction of administrative burdens on physicians. Social and ethical concerns encompassed multiple, divergent themes including the need to train more doctors to overcome workforce shortfalls and misgivings about the acceptability of future technology to patients. However, some GPs believed that the failure to adopt technological innovations could incur harms to both patients and physicians. CONCLUSIONS: This study presents timely information on physicians' views about the scope of artificial intelligence (AI) in primary care. Overwhelmingly, GPs considered the potential of AI to be limited. These views differ from the predictions of biomedical informaticians.

Although this promises to deliver increased speed and accuracy, the future role of AI in relation to radiotherapy should be thought through carefully. There is currently a gap between published developments and widespread adoption, which provides some space to prepare the workforce and to consider the implications on practice. It is rare to find philosophical input into a medical journal, but the advent of AI makes this perspective increasingly important. Philosophical insight can help explore the potential impact of AI, in particular, on human creativity and oversight. Without this perspective, we run the risk of focusing solely on the immediate logistical impact on patients and departments. This commentary identifies three key aspects of radiotherapy that the authors feel would suffer most under AI control: creativity, innovation, and patient safety, which all demand uniquely human attributes. The article also provides insight from a philosophical perspective with regard to human consciousness, ethics, and empathy. Philosophically we should, perhaps, retain ethical concerns about the widening role of AI in radiotherapy beyond simple quantitative interpretation and image processing. As developments continue, we have time to determine how our roles will evolve and to establish a framework for ensuring appropriate human input into patient care. Most importantly, we must start to embed a philosophical approach to adoption of AI technology from the outset if we are to prepare ourselves for the challenge that lies ahead.","2019","2021-02-15 22:21:43","2021-02-15 22:21:43","","27","","4","50","","","Artificial Intelligence in Radiotherapy","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8270569034","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Currently, there are many devices that allow gathering biometric measurements from human beings, such as EEG Headsets or Health Bracelets. The massive data sets generated by tracking of EEG and physiology may be used, among other things, to infer knowledge about human moods and emotions. Apart from direct biometric signal measurement, eye tracking systems are nowadays capable of determining the point of gaze of the users when interacting in ICT environments, which provides an added value research on many different areas, such as psychology or marketing. We present a process in which devices for eye tracking, biometric, and EEG signal measurements are synchronously used for studying both basic and complex emotions. We selected the least intrusive devices for different signal data collection given the study requirements and cost constraints, so users would behave in the most natural way possible. On the one hand, we have been able to determine basic emotions participants were experiencing by means of valence and arousal. On the other hand, a complex emotion such as empathy has also been detected. To validate the usefulness of this approach, a study involving forty-four people has been carried out, where they were exposed to a series of affective stimuli while their EEG activity, biometric signals, and eye position were synchronously recorded to detect self-regulation. The hypothesis of the work was that people who self-regulated would show significantly different results when analyzing their EEG data. Participants were divided into two groups depending on whether Electro Dermal Activity (EDA) data indicated they self-regulated or not. The comparison of the results obtained using different machine learning algorithms for emotion recognition shows that using EEG activity alone as a predictor for self-regulation does not allow properly determining whether a person in self-regulation its emotions while watching affective stimuli. However, adequately combining different data sources in a synchronous way to detect emotions makes it possible to overcome the limitations of single detection methods.","2016","2021-02-15 22:21:43","2021-02-15 22:21:43","","","","","10","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 6810599341","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In social neuroscience, many experiments have sought to first define and then locate 'perspective taking', 'empathy', and other psychological concepts to specific brain circuits. Seldom, bottom-up studies were conducted to first identify explanatory patterns of brain variation, which are then related to psychological concepts; perhaps due to a lack of large population datasets. In this spirit, we performed a systematic de-construction of social brain morphology into its elementary building blocks, involving ~10,000 UK Biobank participants. We explored coherent representations of structural co-variation at population scale within a recent social brain atlas, by translating autoencoder neural networks from deep learning. The learned subnetworks revealed essential patterns of structural relationships between social brain regions, with the nucleus accumbens, medial prefrontal cortex, and temporoparietal junction embedded at the core. Some of the uncovered subnetworks contributed to predicting examined social traits in general, while other subnetworks helped predict specific facets of social functioning, such as the experience of social isolation. As a consequence of our population-level evidence, spatially overlapping subsystems of the social brain probably relate to interindividual differences in everyday social life.","2021","2021-02-15 22:22:36","2021-02-15 22:22:36","","","","1","4","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8881420050","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Internal motivational factors for studying medicine (e.g., care for patients, save lives) coupled with a deep approach to learning have been positively related to empathy in contrast to external motivational factors (e.g., future earning potential, prestige) and surface learning. However, assessments of these assumptions among medical school candidates are scarce. This study examined the relationship between different motivational factors and empathy among students enrolled in a selection year in medicine by testing the mediating role of learning approaches. A sample of 572 candidates for medical studies answered a self-reported questionnaire half way through their selection year. Measures included internal and external motivational factors for studying medicine, deep and surface learning approaches and empathy. Path-analysis tested the mediation effects of deep and surface approaches to learning on the relationship of internal and external motivational factors with empathy. The deep learning approach partially mediated the significant positive association between internal motivational factors and empathy, while the surface learning approach fully mediated the significant negative association between external motivational factors and empathy. These results suggest that learning approaches could be a pathway by which internal and external motives for studying medicine are related to empathy among medical school candidates. Pedagogical strategies and educational environments accounting for individual differences in motivation and learning may contribute to training students to become professional and caring doctors in the future.","2019","2021-02-15 22:22:36","2021-02-15 22:22:36","","287-300","","2","24","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8082508826","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This theory has been originated from the last two decades advancements of systems medicine and digital medicine, science and technology convergence in biological fields and formation of the precision medicine. The transcendent medicine theory that has been derived from Sadr ad-Din Shirazi’s transcendent theosophy looks to medicine with a holistic view.Materials and Methods: In extension of the theory of Transcendent medicine, we discussed paradigm shift in medicine with deep medicine theory and its three components were challenged via the viewpoints of transcendent medicine.Results: The body theosophy which has been derived from the transcendent medicine theory is the counterpart of “deep phenotyping” component of deep medicine. The speculative reason of Ibn-Sins’s science of soul which has been projected in transcendent medicine theory could be compare with “deep learning” component of deep medicine theory. With extraction of Ibn-Arabi’s concept of perfect man and its integration with transcendent medicine, the advanced model this theory could present “deep empathy”, the third component of deep medicine.Conclusion: The transcendent medicine theory expresses all three components of deep medicine in a unique form. Hence, this theory could be used as a tool in the paradigm shift of modern medicine.","2020","2021-02-15 22:22:36","2021-02-15 22:22:36","","70-86","","1","23","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8580238094","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Empathy entails an ability to see and feel the world from another’s perspective—feeling with rather than feeling for. Jake Sully’s identity as shifting, and boundary-crossing, makes him an especially good candidate for empathic cultivation. Sully assumes an avatar identity, stepping into a Na’vi form but also trying on a range of different perspectives, as part of his education in empathy and his spiritual transformation. The film sheds light on the complexity, fragility, and dangers of empathy, as well as its potential as an environmental and humanitarian value. Avatar suggests empathy’s perils, but also illustrates that empathy, properly oriented and cultivated, is an important environmental disposition encouraging appreciation of otherness.","2010","2021-02-15 22:24:01","2021-02-15 22:24:01","","457-477","","","4","","","I See You","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 5847392461","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Analyses focused on the relationship between empathy and two perspective-taking phenomena: Selection between competing perspectives (i.e., perspective-congruence effects) and prioritization of the Self avatar's perspective. Empathy was related to improved overall performance on this task and a reduced cost of selecting between conflicting perspectives (i.e., smaller perspective-congruence effects). This effect was asymmetric, with empathy (i.e., empathic concern) levels predicting reduced interference from a conflicting perspective, especially when adopting the Self (vs. Other) avatar's perspective.

We also studied the impact of the modification of avatar's knee amplitude on kinematic of the knee of healthy subjects. For this purpose, we used an immersive reality treadmill equipment and developed a 3D avatar, with instantly modifiable parameters for knee flexion and extension (acceleration or deceleration). Fourteen healthy young adults, equipped with motion capture markers, were asked to walk at a self-selected pace on the treadmill. A real-time 3D image of their lower limbs was modelized and projected on the screen ahead of them, as if in a walking motion from left to right. The subjects were instructed to continue walking. When we initiated an increase in the knee flexion of the avatar, we observed a similar increase in the subjects' knee flexion. No significant results were observed when the modification involved a decrease in knee flexion. The results and their significance are discussed using theories encompassing empathy, sympathy and sensory re-calibration. The prospect of using this type of modified avatar for stroke rehabilitation is discussed.","2019","2021-02-15 22:24:17","2021-02-15 22:24:17","","e02797","","11","5","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8464682346","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Its first dimension is auto-empathy and refers to an empathetic relationship with oneself: how can a human directing a robot expand the various components of empathy he feels for himself to this robot? The second is direct empathy: what does a human attribute to a robot in terms of thoughts, emotions, action potentials or even altruism, on the model of what he imagines and attributes to himself? The third dimension is reciprocal empathy that consists of thinking that a robot is able to identify with me, feel or guess my emotions and thoughts, anticipate my actions and wear me assistance if necessary. Finally, the fourth dimension, intersubjective empathy, is about thinking and imagining that a robot can inform me of things - emotions, thoughts that I am likely to experience- that I do not know about myself. Each of these four dimensions includes four different components: (1) Action (empathy of action), (2) Emotion (emotional empathy), (3) Cognition (cognitive empathy) and (4) Assistance (empathy of assistance).

A growing number of electroencephalography studies also suggest that it might be useful to assess empathy. The main goal of this study was to use quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) to test whether observation of pain expressed by an avatar (virtual reality) induces a suppression of alpha waves over sensorimotor cortical areas, as it is observed with human stimuli. Not only was it the case, but also the magnitude of alpha suppression was correlated with perspective-taking capacity of participants. Both empathy levels and magnitude of sensorimotor alpha suppression (SAS) were significantly higher in women than men. Interestingly, a significant interaction emerged between levels of individual empathy and specificity of experimental instructions, where SAS in participants with good perspective-taking was higher during passive observation of the distressed avatar, while the opposite was true during an active (trying to understand) condition. These results suggest that: (1) synthetic characters are able to elicit SAS; (2) SAS is indeed associated with perspective-taking capacities; (3) Persons with poorer perspective-taking capacities can show significant SAS when proper instructions are provided. Therefore, qEEG represents a low-cost objective approach to measure perspective-taking abilities.","2018","2021-02-15 22:24:17","2021-02-15 22:24:17","","","","","12","","","Suppression of Sensorimotor Alpha Power Associated With Pain Expressed by an Avatar","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 7787364948","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These claims are based on a moderated mediation model. They reported a three-way interaction between game condition, gender, and avatar identification when predicting masculine ideology in their original study. Masculine ideology was associated, in turn, with decreased empathy. However, there were no main experimental effects for video game condition on empathy. The current analysis considers the strength of the evidence for claims made in the original study on a sample of 153 adolescents (M age = 16.812, SD = 1.241; 44.2% male). We confirmed that there was little evidence for an overall effect of game condition on empathy toward girls or women. We tested the robustness of the original reported moderated mediation models against other, theoretically derived alternatives, and found that effects differed based on how variables were measured (using alternatives in their public data file) and the statistical model used. The experimental groups differed significantly and substantially in terms of age suggesting that there might have been issues with the procedures used to randomly assign participants to conditions. These results highlight the need for preregistration of experimental protocols in video game research and raise some concerns about how moderated mediation models are used to support causal inferences. These results call into question whether use of ""sexist"" video games is a causal factor in the development of reduced empathy toward girls and women among adolescents.","2017","2021-02-15 22:24:46","2021-02-15 22:24:46","","2446-2459","","12","46","","","Are Associations Between ""Sexist"" Video Games and Decreased Empathy Toward Women Robust?","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 7088415745","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The first aim of the study was to assess the beneficial effects of cooperation within a VR scenario, the second aim was to provide preliminary testing of the hypothesis that empathy and political attitudes could contribute to implicit bias about race, while the third aim was to explore the relationship between political attitudes and empathy. We had (Caucasian) participants embodied in a Black virtual body and engaged either in a cooperative (Coop group) or in a non-cooperative (Neutral group) activity with a confederate experimenter embodying another Black avatar. Before and after VR, we measured participants' implicit racial bias by means of Implicit Association Test (IAT) and their perceived closeness toward the confederate experimenter. Before VR we also assessed participants' political attitudes and empathy traits. Results revealed that, as compared to the Neutral group, the Coop group showed lower IAT scores after the social interaction. Interestingly, in the Neutral but not the Coop group the perceived closeness toward the confederate experimenter was associated with the initial racial bias: the more the participants reduced their distance, the more they reduced their IAT score. Moreover, reported traits of empathy and political attitudes significantly explained the variance observed in the initial implicit bias, with perspective-taking, empathic concern, and personal distress being significant predictors of the IAT scores. Finally, there was a relationship between political attitudes and empathy: the more participants considered themselves as left-wing voters, the higher their perspective-taking and empathic concern scores. We discuss these findings within the neuroscientific and social cognition field and encourage scholars from different domains to further explore whether and under which conditions a given manipulation for reducing racial bias could be efficiently transposed in VR.","2020","2021-02-15 22:24:46","2021-02-15 22:24:46","","","","","11","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8698096714","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Participants were exposed to a virtual stranger asking to sit at the table (prosocial behavior) as well as a virtual waiter handing over the false drink (social avoidance). Empathy, interaction anxiety, social and physical presence as well as subjective stress levels were assessed to control for confounding influences. Empathy emerged as a significant predictor of prosocial behavior. Social avoidance, in turn, was not predicted by any of the included variables. Also, there was no effect of agency on social presence, physical presence, social interaction anxiety and stress. Yet, participants showed significantly more social avoidance and prosocial behavior towards avatars.

Grappling with the broad contours of the cultural economy of justice on national television in India, I suggest that the star descends upon television as an avatar promising empathy to a variety of victims of social injustice. In so doing, Khan converts crime news into emotional truths. The show has not only generated public debate, it also invites the public to return to a performative innocence. As television becomes the site of articulating moral authority, ritual participation and demanding social change, the political is re-assembled through Khan's stardom. The paper also enquires how and why the show compels narrative ingenuity towards what Aditya Nigam calls the ‘implosion of the political’-the erasure of the public from the street and its re-inscription in the studio. Equally notable here is the role film-stardom plays in rendering moral authority through the trope of the sacrificial.","2014","2021-02-15 22:24:46","2021-02-15 22:24:46","","239-254","","2","37","","","Satyamev Jayate","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 5594902823","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Digital media has facilitated this trajectory, implicit in the interactive computer interface (Manovich, 2005), but interactivity per se may offer no more than a series of choices put forward by the artist (Daniels, 2011).

Immersed in play they lose a sense of the self (Callois, 2011) and enter a virtual third space where possibilities for creativity and direction of play are limitless.

When this dyad is completed, mind attribution towards intentionally harmed liminal minds is enhanced. However, from a dehumanisation view, malevolent actions may instead result in a denial of humanness. To contrast both accounts, a visual vignette experiment (N = 253) depicted either malevolent or benevolent intentions towards robotic or human avatars. Additionally, we examined the role of harm-salience by showing patients as either harmed, or still unharmed. The results revealed significantly increased mind attribution towards visibly harmed patients, mediated by perceived pain and expressed empathy. Benevolent and malevolent intentions were evaluated respectively as morally right or wrong, but their impact on the patient was diminished for the robotic avatar. Contrary to dehumanisation predictions, our manipulation of intentions failed to affect mind perception. Nonetheless, benevolent intentions reduced dehumanisation of the patients. Moreover, when pain and empathy were statistically controlled, the effect of intentions on mind perception was mediated by dehumanisation. These findings suggest that perceived intentions might only be indirectly tied to mind perception, and that their role may be better understood when additionally accounting for empathy and dehumanisation.","2020","2021-02-15 22:24:46","2021-02-15 22:24:46","","","","","","","","Seeing the mind of robots","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8664634571","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Human perception and performance","","0096-1523","","","It has been proposed that humans possess an automatic system to represent mental states ('implicit mentalizing'). The existence of an implicit mentalizing system has generated considerable debate however, centered on the ability of various experimental paradigms to demonstrate unambiguously such mentalizing. Evidence for implicit mentalizing has previously been provided by the 'dot perspective task,' where participants are slower to verify the number of dots they can see when an avatar can see a different number of dots. However, recent evidence challenged a mentalizing interpretation of this effect by showing it was unaltered when the avatar was replaced with an inanimate arrow stimulus. Here we present an extension of the dot perspective task using an invisibility cloaking device to render the dots invisible on certain trials. This paradigm is capable of providing unambiguous evidence of automatic mentalizing, but no such evidence was found. Two further well-powered experiments used opaque and transparent goggles to manipulate visibility but found no evidence of automatic mentalizing, nor of individual differences in empathy or perspective-taking predicting performance, contradicting previous studies using the same design. The results cast doubt on the existence of an implicit mentalizing system, suggesting that previous effects were due to domain-general processes.

Correspondingly, drift measurements in science are used as a means of rating the intensity of a body-ownership illusion via which a participant in a controlled experiment perceives that an extracorporeal appendage, or virtual whole-body avatar is incorporated as part of one’s own body schema. In this research article, I will examine an applied performance by BeAnotherLab utilising the anti-disciplinary collective’s The Machine to Be Another as part of Good Chance’s Encampment project - this telepresence system produces a VR body illusion intended to increase empathy and reduce proximity between an immersant’s real body and that of a volunteer refugee counterpart. When scientifically-tested body illusions cross a paradigmatic boundary to be framed as immersive art, what are the ethical implications? Furthermore, are these kinds of virtual proprioceptive transactions across different kinds of social and political boundaries symptomatic of radical empathic acts, or a capitalistic desire for the acquisition of another’s experiences by virtual means? This article examines illusory bodily inhabitation through a Levinasian critical lens to consider the ethics of deterritorializing the immersant’s gaze and referring their sense of touch elsewhere to produce ‘narrative immersion’.","2017","2021-02-15 22:24:46","2021-02-15 22:24:46","","30-37","","3","22","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 7138533628","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These games enable the parallel gaming of multiple users in online virtual worlds with or against each other via their graphical agent (avatar). Recent findings suggest online role-playing addicts to have a deficient self-concept. The latter's potential compensation by means of a higher identification with the own avatar might be an etiological factor in the development of an online role-playing game addiction. On a neurobiological level, especially the left Angular Gyrus (AG) seems to be associated with identification and empathy processes. An according fMRI-based study on long-term gamers of online role-playing games indicated increased brain activations in the left AG during the rating of personality traits referring to the avatar relative to self-referencing and the referencing of close others (Ganesh et al., 2011). However, the extent to which these results represent specific neurobiological mechanisms that are associated with self-concept deficits or a stronger identification with the own avatar in the development of online role-playing game addiction remains unknown to date.<br>Methods: N=16 addicted and n=17 regular gamers of online role-playing games (mean age=28 and 26 years, respectively) underwent functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) while 1) completing a Giessen-Test (GT)-derived paradigm assessing participants’ concepts of self, ideal and avatar and 2) while viewing and evaluating images of the own person, the own avatar as well as unknown persons. Additionally, a questionnaire referring to the own body image and a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for the evaluation of the own as well as avatar's attractiveness, sympathy and gender identity were applied.<br>Results: Addicts of online role-playing games rated their body image, gender identity and social response (i.e. social popularity) significantly lower. Neurobiologically, they showed increased left AG activations during the reflection about their avatar (relative to their ideal and/or their self) compared to non-addicted gamers. Furthermore, within-group differences revealed left AG response during the perception of images showing their avatar (relative to images of themselves). In addition, addicted gamers had hypoactivations in the bilateral AG during the perception of images of their own person compared to the perception of unknown persons. The left-lateral AG hypoactivation positively correlated with the degree of the gender identity.<br>Discussion: In line with previous findings, our results indicate self-concept deficits in online role-playing game addicts and a stronger identification with the own avatar, which might neurobiologically be reflected in AG activations. The results could point towards problems in the formation of an own identity as a cause for online role-playing game addiction development.

Impairments of both empathic and visuo-spatial abilities have been observed in patients with schizophrenia. Especially, it has been suggested that schizophrenics are altered in spontaneously simulating another individual's first-person experience. However, there is so far only little evidence regarding the relationship between deficits in empathy and disturbances in spontaneous heterocentered coding in schizophrenia. In the present pilot-study, we tested with schizophrenic patients our behavioural paradigm that enables to measure from the bodily postures and movements whether individuals in ecologically more valid conditions are interacting with another individual by using egocentered - as in sympathy (feeling with someone else) - or heterocentered - as in empathy - visuo-spatial mechanisms. For that, ten patients and ten controls, standing and moving, interacted with a virtual tightrope walker, displayed life-sized, standing and moving as well. We show that patients with higher negative symptoms had, in most cases, deficits in spontaneously using heterocentered visuo-spatial mechanisms and employed preferentially an egocentered referencing to interact with the avatar. In contrast, preserved spontaneous heterocentered visuo-spatial strategies were not linked to a prevailing negative or positive symptomatology. Our data suggest that the severity of the negative symptoms in schizophrenia relates with disturbances of spontaneous (""on-line"") empathic processing in association with lower scoring self-reported trait cognitive empathy.","2014","2021-02-15 22:24:58","2021-02-15 22:24:58","","87-99","","","90","","","Disturbances of spontaneous empathic processing relate with the severity of the negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 5626805970","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the traditional use of didactic lectures for communication skills training is ineffective, and the use of standardized patients is not time- or cost-effective. Given the abilities of virtual patients (VPs) to simulate interactive and authentic clinical scenarios in secured environments with unlimited training attempts, a virtual counseling application is an ideal platform for nursing students to hone their communication skills before their clinical postings. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop and test the use of VPs to better prepare nursing undergraduates for communicating with real-life patients, their family members, and other health care professionals during their clinical postings. METHODS: The stages of the creation of VPs included preparation, design, and development, followed by a testing phase before the official implementation. An initial voice chatbot was trained using a natural language processing engine, Google Cloud's Dialogflow, and was later visualized into a three-dimensional (3D) avatar form using Unity 3D. RESULTS: The VPs included four case scenarios that were congruent with the nursing undergraduates' semesters' learning objectives: (1) assessing the pain experienced by a pregnant woman, (2) taking the history of a depressed patient, (3) escalating a bleeding episode of a postoperative patient to a physician, and (4) showing empathy to a stressed-out fellow final-year nursing student. Challenges arose in terms of content development, technological limitations, and expectations management, which can be resolved by contingency planning, open communication, constant program updates, refinement, and training. CONCLUSIONS: The creation of VPs to assist in nursing students' communication skills training may provide authentic learning environments that enhance students' perceived self-efficacy and confidence in effective communication skills. However, given the infancy stage of this project, further refinement and constant enhancements are needed to train the VPs to simulate real-life conversations before the official implementation.","2019","2021-02-15 22:24:58","2021-02-15 22:24:58","","","","10","21","","","A Virtual Counseling Application Using Artificial Intelligence for Communication Skills Training in Nursing Education","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8293773349","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The behavior that would induce human-like feelings after long exposures is difficult to determine, and it often depends on the cultural background of the observers. Therefore, in this study, we generate an acting performance system for the android, in which an android and a human interact in a stage play in the real world. We adopt the theatrical theory called Contemporary Colloquial Theatre Theory to give the android natural behaviors so that audiences can comfortably observe it even after long-minute exposure. A stage play is created and shown in various locations, and the audiences are requested to report their impressions of the stage and their cultural and psychological backgrounds in a self-evaluating questionnaire. Overall analysis indicates that the audience had positive feelings, in terms of attractiveness, towards the android on the stage even after 20 min of exposure. The singularly high acceptance of the android by Japanese audiences seems to be correlated with a high animism tendency, rather than to empathy. We also discuss how the stage play approach is limited and could be extended to contribute to realization of human-robot interaction in the real world.","2017","2021-02-15 22:25:31","2021-02-15 22:25:31","","","","4","9","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8081433483","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These findings suggest that spontaneous mimicry depends on the salience of humanlike features highlighted by face-to-face contact, emphasizing the role of presence in human-robot interaction. Further, the findings suggest that mimicry of androids can dissociate from knowledge of artificiality and experienced emotional unease. These findings have implications for theoretical debates about the mechanisms of imitation. They also inform creation of future robots that effectively build rapport and engagement with their human users.","2014","2021-02-15 22:25:31","2021-02-15 22:25:31","","","","7","9","","","Bridging the mechanical and the human mind","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 7179929431","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Are mechanisms of action processing in human brain specifically tuned to process biological agents? Humanoid robots can perform recognizable actions, but can look and move differently from humans so they can be used as stimuli to address such questions. Here, we recorded EEG during the observation of human and robot actions. Sensorimotor mu (8-13 Hz) rhythm has been linked to the motor simulation aspect of action processing (and to human mirror neuron system, MNS) and frontal theta (4-8 Hz) rhythm to semantic and memory-related aspects. We explored whether these measures exhibit selectivity for biological entities: for whether the motion and/or the visual appearance of the observed agent is biological. Participants watched videos of three agents performing the same actions. The first was a Human, and had biological motion and appearance. The other two were a state-of-the-art robot in two different appearances: Android, which had biological appearance but mechanical motion, and Robot, which had mechanical motion and appearance. Observation of all agents induced significant attenuation in the power of mu oscillations that was equivalent for all agents. Thus, mu suppression, considered an index of the activity of the MNS, did not appear to be selective for biological agents. Observation of the Robot resulted in greater frontal theta activity compared to the Android and the Human, whereas the latter two did not differ from each other. Frontal theta activity thus appears to be sensitive to visual appearance, suggesting artificial agents that are not sufficiently biological in appearance may result in greater memory processing demands for the observer. Studies combining robotics and neuroscience thus can allow us to explore functional properties of action processing on the one hand, and help inform the design of social robots on the other.","2013","2021-02-15 22:25:31","2021-02-15 22:25:31","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 7181479835","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Even with empathy, non colorblind designers have difficulties to conceive accessible interfaces for colorblind users, because they perceive colors in a different way from users. This work analyses how colorblind simulators and assistive technology can support user interface design. We conduct a search for free software on Google, on Android app store and on Chrome extension store. We identified 4 types of colorblindness simulators (filters of image, screen, sites and mobile device camera) and 3 types of assistive technologies (web sites, mobile app and CSS editor). Secrecy, internet access, time of use and other factors were considered to analyze the use of these simulators and assistive technologies as support for user interface static and dynamic analysis, during formative and summative evaluations.","2017","2021-02-15 22:25:31","2021-02-15 22:25:31","","116-128","","Especial","5","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8864976587","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study aimed to find out the quality of PSC 119 Si Slamet as a prehospital emergency service innovation. The data collection in this study was carried out in a location, namely, Batang Regency, Indonesia, in May-June 2018. The qualitative data collection methods used in this study are in-depth interviews and document reviews. This study was using Service Quality (Servqual) questionnaire. The results show that PSC 119 Si Slamet provides easy access to emergency services to the community 24 hours a day and 7 days a week by simply calling 119 numbers, sending messages via SMS and WhatsApp, or using the Android-based application, with a maximum response time target of 10 minutes. Batang is one of the regencies (rural area) in Central Java province, located on the main coastline, with a hilly geographic condition with many derivatives, climbs, and sharp curves, which is one of the causes of the high number of traffic accidents in the area. This emergency care information systems, with Android-based application, was aimed at improving the quality of services in the health sector, especially emergency services. This service is of good quality as seen from the tangible, reliability, responsiveness, assurance, and empathy dimensions. However, in the implementation, the socialization aspect is not the best to some people. The recommendation given was the need to increase the PSC 119 socialization of Si Slamet not only regionally but also internationally to be massive, especially in developing countries.","2020","2021-02-15 22:25:31","2021-02-15 22:25:31","","75-85","","07","16","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 8615581609","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
