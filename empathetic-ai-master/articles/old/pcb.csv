Many of these decisions are morally salient, including decisions about how benefits and burdens are distributed. Roboticists and ethicists have begun to think carefully about the moral decision making apparatus for machines. Their concerns often center around the plausible claim that robots will lack many of the mental capacities that are indispensable in human moral decision making, such as empathy. To the extent that robots may be robustly artificially intelligent, these concerns subside, but they give way to new worries about creating artificial agents to do our bidding, if those artificial agents have moral standing. We suggest that the question of AI consciousness poses a dilemma. Whether artificially intelligent agents will be conscious or not, we will face serious difficulties in programming them to reliably make moral decisions.","2016-10-01","2021-02-10 15:31:36","2021-02-10 15:31:56","2021-02-10 15:31:36","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Issue: 2 Pages: 313-335 Volume: 30 DOI: 10.5840/ijap201712375","","C:\Users\esben\Zotero\storage\CKY9LXQF\ijap_2016_0030_0002_0313_0335.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is imperative in view of superintelligent Al, which may escape human control. The information age poses quandaries regarding the uses and abuses of technology. A major critique concerns the commercial design of digital technologies that engenders compulsive behavior. All technologies affect humans in a reciprocal way. The new digital technologies-from smartphones to the Internet—where humans are tethered to machines, can impair our autonomy, hijack attention, rewire the brain, and diminish concentration, empathy, knowledge, and wisdom. The remedy is to restore deep reading, human interactions, personal conversations, real friendships, and respect for autonomy and privacy, building a nurturing culture of tolerance, coupled with transcendent norms and ideals worthy of a creature created in the image and likeness of God. This aspiration should be at the center of a new interdisciplinary field of inquiry—a phenomenology of communications.","2020-11-24","2021-02-15 19:38:25","2021-02-15 19:38:25","2021-02-15 19:38:25","","","","","","","Taming the Digital Behemoth","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Issue: 1/2 Pages: 1-16 Volume: 32 DOI: 10.5840/jis2020321/21","","C:\Users\esben\Zotero\storage\HYTGLTLF\jis_2020_0032_0001_0001_0016.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper I will follow Harvey and argue that in order to live a life of moral endeavor, it is not enough merely to know about injustice. Instead, we must engage in the difficult and often painful task of overcoming deep-seated cognitive biases that cause us to fail to perceive the ubiquitous injustice that pervades our world. I will conclude by arguing that education, empathy, and love can each help us to increase our perceptual awareness of injustice and so should be recognized to be crucial parts of a life of moral endeavor.","2015-07-01","2021-02-15 19:38:28","2021-02-15 19:38:28","2021-02-15 19:38:28","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Pages: 129-139 Volume: 31 DOI: 10.5840/socphiltoday20157619","","C:\Users\esben\Zotero\storage\UQ6XBZDF\socphiltoday_2015_0031_0129_0139.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
