Also, human dyadic bonds require some common beliefs such as empathetic behaviour for better interaction. In this sense, research studies involving human-agent interaction should resource on affect, cognition, and memory integration. The developed artificial agent system (SensAI+Expanse) includes machine learning algorithms, heuristics, and memory as cognition aids towards emotional valence prediction on the interacting human. Further, an adaptive empathy score is always present in order to engage the human in a recognisable interaction outcome. [...] The agent is resilient on collecting data, adapts its cognitive processes to each human individual in a learning best effort for proper contextualised prediction. The current study make use of an achieved adaptive process. Also, the use of individual prediction models with specific options of the learning algorithm and evaluation metric from a previous research study. The accomplished solution includes a highly performant prediction ability, an efficient energy use, and feature importance explanation for predicted probabilities. Results of the present study show evidence of significant emotional valence behaviour differences between some age ranges and gender combinations. Therefore, this work contributes with an artificial intelligent agent able to assist on cognitive science studies. This ability is about affective disturbances by means of predicting human emotional valence contextualised in space and time. Moreover, contributes with learning processes and heuristics fit to the task including economy of cognition and memory to cope with the environment.

In Spring 2019, we conducted a web-based survey of 791 psychiatrists from 22 countries worldwide. The survey measured opinions about the likelihood future technology would fully replace physicians in performing ten key psychiatric tasks. This study involved qualitative descriptive analysis of written response to three open-ended questions in the survey. Comments were classified into four major categories in relation to the impact of future technology on patient-psychiatric interactions, the quality of patient medical care, the profession of psychiatry, and health systems. Overwhelmingly, psychiatrists were skeptical that technology could fully replace human empathy. Many predicted that 'man and machine' would increasingly collaborate in undertaking clinical decisions, with mixed opinions about the benefits and harms of such an arrangement. Participants were optimistic that technology might improve efficiencies and access to care, and reduce costs. Ethical and regulatory considerations received limited attention. This study presents timely information of psychiatrists' view about the scope of artificial intelligence and machine learning on psychiatric practice.

A large number of current approaches that address this problem focus on classifying emotion expressions by grouping them into known categories. Such strategies neglect, among other aspects, the impact of the affective responses from an individual on their interaction partner thus ignoring how people empathize towards each other. This is also reflected in the datasets used to train models for affective processing tasks. Most of the recent datasets, in particular, the ones which capture natural interactions (""in-the-wild"" datasets), are designed, collected, and annotated based on the recognition of displayed affective reactions, ignoring how these displayed or expressed emotions are perceived. In this paper, we propose a novel dataset composed of dyadic interactions designed, collected and annotated with a focus on measuring the affective impact that eight different stories have on the listener. Each video of the dataset contains around 5 minutes of interaction where a speaker tells a story to a listener. After each interaction, the listener annotated, using a valence scale, how the story impacted their affective state, reflecting how they empathized with the speaker as well as the story. We also propose different evaluation protocols and a baseline that encourages participation in the advancement of the field of artificial empathy and emotion contagion.","2019-08-30","2021-02-07 22:17:41","2021-02-07 22:17:41","2021-02-07 22:17:41","","","","","","","The OMG-Empathy Dataset","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv: 1908.11706","Comment: 2019 8th International Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction (ACII)","C:\Users\esben\Zotero\storage\3PZPMDQF\Barros et al. - 2019 - The OMG-Empathy Dataset Evaluating the Impact of .pdf; C:\Users\esben\Zotero\storage\MXKBN6TS\1908.html","","","Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science - Human-Computer Interaction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we work towards this goal by bringing together a number of important concepts: empathy, AI planning, and reasoning in the presence of knowledge and belief. We formalize the notion of Empathetic Planning which is informed by the beliefs and affective state of the empathizee. We appeal to an epistemic logic framework to represent the beliefs of the empathizee and propose AI planning-based computational approaches to compute empathetic solutions.

The Utility of Empathetic Parameter Estimation in Multi-Agent Interactions","arXiv:2011.02047 [cs]","","","","http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.02047","Human-robot interactions (HRI) can be modeled as dynamic or differential games with incomplete information, where each agent holds private reward parameters. Due to the open challenge in finding perfect Bayesian equilibria of such games, existing studies often consider approximated solutions composed of parameter estimation and motion planning steps, in order to decouple the belief and physical dynamics. In parameter estimation, current approaches often assume that the reward parameters of the robot are known by the humans. We argue that by falsely conditioning on this assumption, the robot performs non-empathetic estimation of the humans' parameters, leading to undesirable values even in the simplest interactions. We test this argument by studying a two-vehicle uncontrolled intersection case with short reaction time. Results show that when both agents are unknowingly aggressive (or non-aggressive), empathy leads to more effective parameter estimation and higher reward values, suggesting that empathy is necessary when the true parameters of agents mismatch with their common belief. The proposed estimation and planning algorithms are therefore more robust than the existing approaches, by fully acknowledging the nature of information asymmetry in HRI. Lastly, we introduce value approximation techniques for real-time execution of the proposed algorithms.","2020-11-03","2021-02-15 21:06:05","2021-02-15 21:06:05","2021-02-15 21:06:05","","","","","","","When Shall I Be Empathetic?","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv: 2011.02047","Comment: Submitted to ICRA2021","C:\Users\esben\Zotero\storage\WSY7IKJS\Chen et al. - 2020 - When Shall I Be Empathetic The Utility of Empathe.pdf; C:\Users\esben\Zotero\storage\LN4G4JB4\2011.html","","","Computer Science - Robotics; Computer Science - Computer Science and Game Theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One such aspect of the user is empathy. Whereas many studies measure empathy through offline measures that are collected after empathic stimulation (e.g. post-hoc questionnaires), the current study aimed to measure empathy online, using brain activity collected during the experience. Participants watched an affective 360 video of a child experiencing domestic violence in a virtual reality headset while their EEG signals were recorded. Results showed a significant attenuation of alpha, theta and delta asymmetry in the frontal and central areas of the brain. Moreover, a significant relationship between participants' empathy scores and their frontal alpha asymmetry at baseline was found. These results demonstrate specific brain activity alterations when participants are exposed to an affective virtual reality environment, with the level of empathy as a personality trait being visible in brain activity during a baseline measurement. These findings suggest the potential of EEG measurements for development of passive brain-computer interfaces that assess the user's affective responses in real-time and consequently adapt the behavior of socially intelligent agents for a personalized interaction.","2020-03-24","2021-02-15 21:06:06","2021-02-15 21:06:06","2021-02-15 21:06:06","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv: 2003.10886","Comment: 13 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables","C:\Users\esben\Zotero\storage\I5CMYCAE\Alimardani et al. - 2020 - Assessment of Empathy in an Affective VR Environme.pdf; C:\Users\esben\Zotero\storage\V7WL2ADY\2003.html","","","Computer Science - Human-Computer Interaction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(2) Can an empathic robot sustain positive educational outcomes in long-term collaborative learning interactions with groups of students? To answer these questions, we developed an autonomous robot with empathic competencies that is able to interact with a group of students in a learning activity about sustainable development. Two studies were conducted. The first study compares learning outcomes in children across 3 conditions: learning with an empathic robot; learning with a robot without empathic capabilities; and learning without a robot. The results show that the autonomous robot with empathy fosters meaningful discussions about sustainability, which is a learning outcome in sustainability education. The second study features groups of students who interact with the robot in a school classroom for two months.

Therefore, if the mechanism of emotions were elucidated, we could advance toward the essential understanding of our natural intelligence. In this study, a model of emotions is proposed to elucidate the mechanism of emotions through the computational model. Furthermore, from the viewpoint of partner robots, the model of emotions may help us to build robots that can have empathy for humans. To understand and sympathize with people's feelings, the robots need to have their own emotions. This may allow robots to be accepted in human society.

This work presents some effects of users' psychology in mean-field-type games. In addition to the traditional ""material"" payoff modelling, psychological patterns are introduced in order to better capture and understand behaviors that are observed in engineering practice or in experimental settings. The psychological payoff value depends upon choices, mean-field states, mean-field actions, empathy and beliefs. It is shown that the affective empathy enforces mean-field equilibrium payoff equity and improves fairness between the players. It establishes equilibrium systems for such interactive decision-making problems. Basic empathy concepts are illustrated in several important problems in engineering including resource sharing, packet collision minimization, energy markets, and forwarding in Device-to-Device communications. The work conducts also an experiment with 47 people who have to decide whether to cooperate or not. The basic Interpersonal Reactivity Index of empathy metrics were used to measure the empathy distribution of each participant.

Unfair reviews, created when requesters consider factors outside of a worker's control, are known to plague gig workers and can result in lost job opportunities and even termination from the marketplace. Our tool leverages machine learning to implement an intelligent interface that: (1) uses deep learning to automatically detect when an individual has included unfair factors into her review (factors outside the worker's control per the policies of the market); and (2) prompts the individual to reconsider her review if she has incorporated unfair factors. To study the effectiveness of Reputation Agent, we conducted a controlled experiment over different gig markets. Our experiment illustrates that across markets, Reputation Agent, in contrast with traditional approaches, motivates requesters to review gig workers' performance more fairly. We discuss how tools that bring more transparency to employers about the policies of a gig market can help build empathy thus resulting in reasoned discussions around potential injustices towards workers generated by these interfaces.

This study aimed to explore psychiatrists' opinions about the potential impact of innovations in artificial intelligence and machine learning on psychiatric practice. In Spring 2019, we conducted a web-based survey of 791 psychiatrists from 22 countries worldwide. The survey measured opinions about the likelihood future technology would fully replace physicians in performing ten key psychiatric tasks. This study involved qualitative descriptive analysis of written response to three open-ended questions in the survey. Comments were classified into four major categories in relation to the impact of future technology on patient-psychiatric interactions, the quality of patient medical care, the profession of psychiatry, and health systems. Overwhelmingly, psychiatrists were skeptical that technology could fully replace human empathy. Many predicted that 'man and machine' would increasingly collaborate in undertaking clinical decisions, with mixed opinions about the benefits and harms of such an arrangement. Participants were optimistic that technology might improve efficiencies and access to care, and reduce costs. Ethical and regulatory considerations received limited attention. This study presents timely information of psychiatrists' view about the scope of artificial intelligence and machine learning on psychiatric practice.

In order to make such communication possible, the machines need an empathy module in them which can extract emotions from human speech and behavior and can decide the correct response of the robot.

If successful, web-based mental health conversations could improve access to treatment and reduce the global disease burden. Psychologists have repeatedly demonstrated that empathy, the ability to understand and feel the emotions and experiences of others, is a key component leading to positive outcomes in supportive conversations. However, recent studies have shown that highly empathic conversations are rare in online mental health platforms. In this paper, we work towards improving empathy in online mental health support conversations. We introduce a new task of empathic rewriting which aims to transform low-empathy conversational posts to higher empathy. Learning such transformations is challenging and requires a deep understanding of empathy while maintaining conversation quality through text fluency and specificity to the conversational context. Here we propose PARTNER, a deep reinforcement learning agent that learns to make sentence-level edits to posts in order to increase the expressed level of empathy while maintaining conversation quality. Our RL agent leverages a policy network, based on a transformer language model adapted from GPT-2, which performs the dual task of generating candidate empathic sentences and adding those sentences at appropriate positions. During training, we reward transformations that increase empathy in posts while maintaining text fluency, context specificity and diversity. Through a combination of automatic and human evaluation, we demonstrate that PARTNER successfully generates more empathic, specific, and diverse responses and outperforms NLP methods from related tasks like style transfer and empathic dialogue generation. Our work has direct implications for facilitating empathic conversations on web-based platforms.","2021-01-19","2021-02-15 21:10:27","2021-02-15 21:10:27","2021-02-15 21:10:27","","","","","","","Towards Facilitating Empathic Conversations in Online Mental Health Support","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv: 2101.07714","Comment: Accepted for publication at WWW 2021","C:\Users\esben\Zotero\storage\RBCWCEPK\Sharma et al. - 2021 - Towards Facilitating Empathic Conversations in Onl.pdf; C:\Users\esben\Zotero\storage\6C9N8CW4\2101.html","","","Computer Science - Computation and Language; Computer Science - Social and Information Networks","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Emotion analysis of text is increasing in popularity in NLP; however, manually creating lexica for psychological constructs such as empathy has proven difficult. This paper automatically creates empathy word ratings from document-level ratings. The underlying problem of learning word ratings from higher-level supervision has to date only been addressed in an ad hoc fashion and has not used deep learning methods. We systematically compare a number of approaches to learning word ratings from higher-level supervision against a Mixed-Level Feed Forward Network (MLFFN), which we find performs best, and use the MLFFN to create the first-ever empathy lexicon.

Unfair reviews, created when requesters consider factors outside of a worker's control, are known to plague gig workers and can result in lost job opportunities and even termination from the marketplace. Our tool leverages machine learning to implement an intelligent interface that: (1) uses deep learning to automatically detect when an individual has included unfair factors into her review (factors outside the worker's control per the policies of the market); and (2) prompts the individual to reconsider her review if she has incorporated unfair factors. To study the effectiveness of Reputation Agent, we conducted a controlled experiment over different gig markets. Our experiment illustrates that across markets, Reputation Agent, in contrast with traditional approaches, motivates requesters to review gig workers' performance more fairly. We discuss how tools that bring more transparency to employers about the policies of a gig market can help build empathy thus resulting in reasoned discussions around potential injustices towards workers generated by these interfaces. Our vision is that with tools that promote truth and transparency we can bring fairer treatment to gig workers.","2020-04-20","2021-02-15 21:10:30","2021-02-15 21:10:30","2021-02-15 21:10:29","1228-1240","","","","","","Reputation Agent","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv: 2005.06022","Comment: 12 pages, 5 figures, The Web Conference 2020, ACM WWW 2020","C:\Users\esben\Zotero\storage\2UQ4X4DE\Toxtli et al. - 2020 - Reputation Agent Prompting Fair Reviews in Gig Ma.pdf; C:\Users\esben\Zotero\storage\AL95SWRP\2005.html","","","Computer Science - Machine Learning; Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science - Human-Computer Interaction; I.2.7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One such aspect of the user is empathy. Whereas many studies measure empathy through offline measures that are collected after empathic stimulation (e.g. post-hoc questionnaires), the current study aimed to measure empathy online, using brain activity collected during the experience. Participants watched an affective 360 video of a child experiencing domestic violence in a virtual reality headset while their EEG signals were recorded. Results showed a significant attenuation of alpha, theta and delta asymmetry in the frontal and central areas of the brain. Moreover, a significant relationship between participants' empathy scores and their frontal alpha asymmetry at baseline was found. These results demonstrate specific brain activity alterations when participants are exposed to an affective virtual reality environment, with the level of empathy as a personality trait being visible in brain activity during a baseline measurement. These findings suggest the potential of EEG measurements for development of passive brain-computer interfaces that assess the user's affective responses in real-time and consequently adapt the behavior of socially intelligent agents for a personalized interaction.","2020-03-24","2021-02-15 21:12:04","2021-02-15 21:12:04","2021-02-15 21:12:03","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv: 2003.10886","Comment: 13 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables","C:\Users\esben\Zotero\storage\5P9F7THJ\Alimardani et al. - 2020 - Assessment of Empathy in an Affective VR Environme.pdf; C:\Users\esben\Zotero\storage\HEDNKYS8\2003.html","","","Computer Science - Human-Computer Interaction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This work presents some effects of users' psychology in mean-field-type games. In addition to the traditional ""material"" payoff modelling, psychological patterns are introduced in order to better capture and understand behaviors that are observed in engineering practice or in experimental settings. The psychological payoff value depends upon choices, mean-field states, mean-field actions, empathy and beliefs. It is shown that the affective empathy enforces mean-field equilibrium payoff equity and improves fairness between the players. It establishes equilibrium systems for such interactive decision-making problems. Basic empathy concepts are illustrated in several important problems in engineering including resource sharing, packet collision minimization, energy markets, and forwarding in Device-to-Device communications. The work conducts also an experiment with 47 people who have to decide whether to cooperate or not. The basic Interpersonal Reactivity Index of empathy metrics were used to measure the empathy distribution of each participant. Android app called Empathizer is developed to analyze systematically the data obtained from the participants. The experimental results reveal that the dominated strategies of the classical game theory are not dominated any more when users' psychology is involved, and a significant level of cooperation is observed among the users who are positively partially empathetic.","2017-02-25","2021-02-15 21:12:34","2021-02-15 21:12:34","2021-02-15 21:12:34","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv: 1702.05355","Comment: 44 pages","C:\Users\esben\Zotero\storage\B9KNAD2W\Rossi et al. - 2017 - How Much Does Users' Psychology Matter in Engineer.pdf; C:\Users\esben\Zotero\storage\XB7X9CLU\1702.html","","","Computer Science - Computer Science and Game Theory; Computer Science - Multiagent Systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
